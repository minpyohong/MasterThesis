Based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the top cryptocurrency by market cap moved from just under $8,700 at 01:00 UTC to $9,009 around 10:00 UTC – the third attempt to break through this morning.At press time, prices had dropped back to $8,841 – a gain of 1.05 percent over 24 hours. “$9,000 would be a test as it is seen as a key resistance level, both from a technical and psychological point of view,"" wrote Simon Peters, eToro analyst and crypto expert, in a note Friday. ""Such an increase would also see the price challenge the current 200-day moving average, a strong indication that bitcoin is entering into bullish territory."" He added: ""However, there is always the risk of retracement if the community thinks bitcoin is overbought."" The recent rally has not just bitcoin-only movement. Most other cryptocurrencies have also experienced strong gains in the past 24 hours. Coins in the top 10, including ether, XRP and Binance coin, are also coming close to two-month highs. There are also some outliers. Following the launch of Binance futures Thursday, ethereum classic is now trading at just below $10, the highest since October 2018. This strong surge in alternative cryptocurrencies has had a slight effect on the broader dynamics of the asset class. Bitcoin dominance – the coin's share of the total cryptocurrency market – has dropped from nearly 2 percent since last Friday. Bitcoin currently makes up approximately 66 percent of the total market, according to CoinMarketCap. Declining dominance suggests traders are placing proportionally less value into bitcoin, attracted to the possibility of making better returns from bets outside of the original cryptocurrency. Should the bulls be able to push bitcoin firmly back above the $9,000 threshold, the market may face a short squeeze  – a sharp rise in a particular asset's price following a series of mass liquidations. There's some precedent for this. In the space of a few days at the beginning of April last year, bitcoin increased by more than $1,000 after finally moving past the long-fought-over $4,200 resistance line. Data collected by crypto analytics site Skew show that the April move caused more than $500 million worth of short liquidations on BitMEX (see chart below). According to CoinGecko, BitMEX’s BTC/USD derivatives volumes have increased over the past seven days. Daily volumes were approaching $3.5 billion at press time, more than a billion dollars higher than last Friday.Helped along by the hype surrounding Facebook's Libra coin, the April move triggered a bull run that ultimately took bitcoin up to $13,000 by the end of June 2019. Looking at prices today, it's possible that should a short squeeze happen soon, the stars could align for a second time.

That was the highest level since Oct. 26, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $10,130, representing 3 percent gains on a 24-hour basis. The move above $10,000 is accompanied by an improvement in the on-chain fundamentals and looks sustainable. “This breakout is the real deal. Fundamental investment activity is backing this $10k breakout,” Willy Woo, partner at Adaptive Capital, tweeted early Sunday. With the surge above $10,000, the cryptocurrency's year-to-date gains have risen to 41 percent and its market capitalization has increased to $183 billion. The cryptocurrency is now up more than $3,500 from the low of $6,425 registered in mid-December. Bitcoin picked up a bid below $7,000 in early January and has been rising ever since in a textbook bull move: a steady uptrend with regular low-volume pullbacks testing dip demand.Bigger gains for altcoinsA majority of top alternative cryptocurrencies (or ""altcoins"") are outperforming bitcoin, leading bitcoin’s dominance of the overall cryptocurrency market to fall to 64 percent, the lowest level in seven-months.Ethereum’s ether token (ETH) is currently trading at $230, the highest level since August, a 78 percent gain on a year-to-date basis. Prominent names like litecoin (LTC), EOS and binance coin (BNB) are up 70 to 90 percent, and bitcoin cash (BCH) and bitcoin SV (BSV) added 120 percent and 250 percent, respectively, according to data site CoinMarketCap. These coins, however, are lagging bitcoin on a 24-hour basis.

Global Head of crypto trading giant Cumberland,  Chris Zuehlke said institutional investors are seeking traditional risk management tools to support greater entry into crypto.“As with any new financial product, we expect volume will grow organically as investors get more comfortable trading it,”  Zuehlke said.An option on a futures contract gives a holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price on or before the option's expiration date.Joshua Green, head of trading at cryptocurrency trading firm Digital Asset Capital Management, said the rise in BTC’s value was “nothing obvious” citing a potential short-squeeze.“Maybe some negative gamma from spot moving through that strike (of $8,250) or people covering shorts that were put on in a notification of Chinese New Year sell-off,” Green said.  Justin Chow, global head of business development at Cumberland said BTC's recent rally was being led by altcoins, specifically BTC forks such as Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin Cash.""While the CME BTC Options launch corresponded to the move, BTC forked coins and other altcoins that have upcoming halvings are the strongest performers,"" Chow said.BSV and BCH are currently posting a 22.1 and 6.84 percent rise respectively over a 24-hour period.Other notable cryptocurrencies are also up on BTC’s good fortune with ether and XRP both up 2.95 and 2.16 percent, respectively.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","The top cryptocurrency by market value dropped from $10,197 to $9,732 during the Asian trading hours and is currently trading at $9,850, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. The
sharp pullback has blanketed Sunday's ascent from $9,900 to $10,180 and is suggesting
bullish exhaustion.Bitcoin
closed out (UTC) Sunday with a 2.75 percent gain, having risen by 5, 1.4, 0.5 and
1 percent on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, respectively.That is the longest daily winning streak in five months, as seen below. Bitcoin produced five straight green candles (days with net gains) from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3, marking a convincing move higher from $9,350 to $10,783. The rally, however, ended up recharging bears' engines for a deeper slide. The latest winning streak is preceded by a sharp rise from lows near $6,850 observed in early January. Such solid rallies are often followed by corrections. Bitcoin could soon test dip demand by revisiting deeper support levels.Bitcoin ended Sunday with a green ""marubozu"" candle, which comprises a strong body and small or no wicks. It indicates buyers were in control from the open to the close, and is reflective of strong bullish sentiment.So far, however, the followthrough has been negative. In fact, today's red candle has already engulfed Sunday's bullish marubozu. A failed bullish marubozu at multi-month highs, or after notable price rallies, often precedes a deeper pullback. So, a slide to the former resistance-turned-support at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose the Jan. 19 high of $9,188 and the Feb. 4 low of $9,075.  The short-term outlook would turn bearish if prices find acceptance below $9,075, invalidating the higher-lows setup. If the support at $9,586 holds ground, the bulls will likely once more target the Oct. 26 high of $10,350. Bitcoin has lost its upward trajectory, as indicated by the downside break of the ascending trendline. The
ongoing drop looks to have legs as it is backed by an uptick in selling volume,
as represented by red bars. The case for a deeper pullback to $9,586 would be invalidated if prices rise above $10,010 with strong volumes, invalidating the lower-highs setup on the hourly chart.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writingThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,530, representing a 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices are now up nearly 10 percent from lows near $6,850 registered during the Asian trading hours on Friday. Notably, the cryptocurrency picked up a bid at lows near $6,850 after the U.S. launched an airstrike at Baghdad’s international airport, killing top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. Tensions escalated over the weekend, with Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promising revenge and President Trump warning Tehran against retaliatory actions. Through all this, bitcoin remained bid and hit a two-week high of $7,580 earlier Monday. Hence, many in the investor community think the U.S.-Iran tensions are powering gains in bitcoin. After all, the cryptocurrency is considered as digital gold by the likes of Michael Novogratz, the founder of the cryptocurrency asset management firm Galaxy Digital.  Novogratz tweeted on Sunday:Backing Novogratz's view is popular trader Holger Zchaepitz, who expects bitcoin and gold to continue rising on the back of tensions in the Middle East. While Novogratz and Zchaepitz consider bitcoin a safe haven, trader Ran NeuNer believes the cryptocurrency is still an uncorrelated asset and could be the best hedge against risk intensification. With the safe-haven narrative strengthening, bitcoin looks set to scale resistance at $7,580. Bitcoin is forming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart (Bitstamp prices). A UTC close above $7,580 would confirm the breakout (a short-term bearish-to-bullish trend change) and open the doors for $8,735 (target as per the measured move method). The breakout looks likely, with the 14-day relative strength index hovering at a two-month high of 56.00. A reading above 50 indicates bullish conditions. The long-tails attached to the hammer candle created in the seven days to Dec. 22 and the last week's doji candle indicate seller exhaustion and support the case for a breakout on the daily chart. Even so, the bulls are cautioned against being too ambitious, as prominent analysts like @BitBitCrypto and Peter Schiff think the cryptocurrency has rallied since Friday due to speculators buying on the hope that bitcoin will attract haven demand from traditional investors. So, an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout could end up trapping bulls on the wrong side of the market or may remain elusive if that flow dries up. A failure to hold above today's low of $7,342 would validate the bearish view put forward by the descending 10-week moving average and likely yield a re-test of $6,850.

averages eyeing their first bullish crossover since March 2019.","Feb 3, 2020 at 11:15 UTC",Bitcoin printed a three-month high on major exchanges early Monday with key indicator eyeing its first bullish turn in 11 months. ,"Prices rose to $9,615 on
Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange during the Asian trading hours. That was the
highest level since Oct. 28. The top cryptocurrency also hit a three-month high
of $9,628 and $9,615 on Bitfinex and Coinbase, respectively. Meanwhile, bitcoin’s global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), fell $30 short of Friday’s high of $9,633 – the highest level since the end of October. Notably, the move higher happened as China’s stock market fell 8 percent in early trading – likely due to the coronavirus outbreak and its potential impact on the nation's economy. The Chinese equity markets were closed last week for the extended New Year holiday. Futures on the S&P 500, however, remained bid and rose 0.65 percent despite the risk-off mood in the Chinese markets. Traditional safe havens like gold are also facing selling pressure at press time – a sign the broader markets may be done pricing the negative impact of coronavirus on the global economy. Interestingly, bitcoin’s break above $9,600 was quickly undone with a drop back to $9,250. The cryptocurrency was last seen trading around $9,330, representing a marginal loss on a 24-hour basis. Despite the pullback from three-month highs, the overall trend remains bullish with the list of technical indicators calling an upside move growing with each passing week.Soon to join that bandwagon is a bull cross of the 50- and 100-day moving averages (MAs), as seen below.The 50-day MA is trending north and looks set to cross above the 100-day MA in the next day or two. The resulting bullish crossover would be the first since March 2019. MA crossovers are lagging indicators and often trap buyers on the wrong side of the market. For instance, the 50- and 100-day bull cross observed in June and August 2018 has failed to inspire buyers. However, back then the broader market conditions were bearish – bitcoin topped out at $20,000 in December 2017 and had been charting lower highs ever since. Such crossovers, however, are widely followed and tend to attract stronger buying pressure when the broader market conditions are looking bullish. The latest bull cross is accompanied by a bullish higher lows and higher highs setup. Further, key indicators like the weekly MACD histogram and the relative strength index are reporting bullish conditions. Hence,
BTC may see increased chart-driven buying on the back of the bull cross. As for the next 24 hours, the odds appear stacked in favor of a drop to $9,000.The four-hour chart shows bitcoin has been largely restricted to a narrow range of $9,200-$9,600 since Jan. 29. A
convincing move above $9,600 would imply a continuation of the rally from the
Jan. 24 low of $8,213 and open the doors to $10,000.A
downside break would expose the psychological support of $9,000. If that level
is breached, sellers will likely attack the 200-day MA located at $8,874. The RSI on the four-hour chart is trending south, indicating scope for a range breakdown. Supporting the bear case is the long upper shadow attached to today’s daily candle. Dips to the 200-day MA, if any, will likely be short-lived, as longer-term indicators are biased bullish.  Disclosure: The author does not currently hold any digital assets.

Bitcoin is now up by more than 30 percent from the low of $6,425 reached in December 2019. While the cryptocurrency is showing signs of life following the gloomy second half of 2019, a widely tracked technical indicator is about to flash a bearish signal. The 50-candle average on the three-day chart is trending south and looks set to cross below the 100-candle average in the next few days. That would be the first bearish crossover of the two averages since June 2018. However, moving averages are based on historical data and tend to lag prices. To put it another way, crossovers are the result of the price action that has already happened and have limited predictive powers. While bitcoin did drop in the days leading up to and after the confirmation of the same bear cross in June 2018, the broader market conditions were bearish at the time, as seen below. The 50- and 100-candle MAs produced a bear cross in the three days to June 21, 2018 (above left). Prices had fallen from $7,800 to $6,300 in the first two weeks of June and dropped further to lows below $5,800 by the end of the month. A subsequent rise ended up creating a bearish lower high at $8,500 and prices remained below the 50-candle MA till April 2019. It's worth noting that bitcoin had rallied by more than 1,300 percent in 2017 before falling by 50 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Essentially, the market had a hard landing after the staggering annual gain, and the bear cross likely gave traders a reason to unwind their long positions. This time, however, the situation is very different. Bitcoin has recently broken out of a six-month falling channel, signaling a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019 and opening doors for a re-test of October highs above $10,000.Further, the breakout comes four months ahead of the mining reward halving – a process that reduces the supply of bitcoin. Alex Benfield, data analyst at Digital Assets Data, told CoinDesk the event could bode well for prices.Historically, bitcoin tends to hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving, but before the event, according to popular analyst Rekt Capital.  So, the cryptocurrency could rise above the 2019 high of $13,880 ahead of the May 2020 halving. All in all, the impending three-day chart bearish crossover should not be a cause for worry for the bulls. The high-volume bounce from the ascending trendline on the 4-hour chart (above left) indicates the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,853 has resumed. Prices could challenge the 200-day average resistance at $9,097 (above right) in the next few days. The daily chart (above right) also indicates the path of least resistance is to the higher side. For instance, the recent inverse head-and-shoulders breakout and the subsequent rise to two-month highs is telling a tale of a successful transition from a bearish-to-bullish setup. The immediate bullish case would weaken if prices close (UTC) below $8,200 today. That level acted as strong resistance multiple times over the weekend. A UTC close below the higher low of $7,667 created on June 10 is needed to confirm a short-term bearish reversal.

The weekly chart is also aligned in favor ...","Jan 27, 2020 at 11:20 UTC","Bitcoin has erased much of the losses seen in the second half of the last week and looks set to revisit resistance near $8,800.","The number one cryptocurrency found bids near $8,270 during the Asian trading hours on Sunday and rose as high as $8,677 around 01:00 UTC Monday, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. With the $400 recovery, bitcoin has retraced 80 percent of the drop from $8,793 to $8,213 observed during the three days to Jan. 25. Some analysts believe the overnight price rise has marked an end of the corrective pullback from the Jan. 19 high of $9,188 and has put the bulls back in the driver's seat. The argument has merit, as the correction had taken the shape of a typically bullish falling-wedge pattern, which was breached to the higher side 24 hours ago. As a result, bitcoin looks set to challenge higher resistance levels. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands near $8,610, representing a 2 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin activated twin bullish cues on Sunday: the move above $8,350 confirming a wedge breakout, and the break above $8,530 confirming a double-bottom breakout. The latter has been reinforced by dip demand near $8,530, as highlighted by the long tail attached to the current four-hour candle.The falling-wedge breakout indicates the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,850 has resumed, while the double bottom breakout has opened the doors for $8,800 (target as per the measured move method). That roughly coincides with Wednesday's high of $8,793, the level at which bitcoin started to fall. A break above $8,793 would expose the 200-day average lined up near $9,000. If that hurdle is crossed, the recent high of $9,188 would come into play. However, the cryptocurrency may have a tough time forcing a break above $8,793 if trading volumes continue to remain weak.As can be seen on the above chart, volumes haven't picked up post-breakout. Green bars, representing buying volumes, have been smaller than the red bars (selling) observed throughout the pullback from $9,200. The MACD histogram, an indicator used to identify trend changes and trend strength, has crossed above zero, signaling a bullish reversal on the weekly chart for the first time since August. With the shift, the bullish signal provided by the falling channel breakout witnessed earlier this month has gained credence. The immediate bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under $8,530. In that case, sellers may test dip demand by pushing prices to last week's low of $8,200.

began ...","Jan 10, 2020 at 16:50 UTC","Bitcoin likely carved out a major price bottom in December, according to a non-price metric, which has proved to be a reliable price indicator in the past. ","The leading cryptocurrency is currently trading above $7,700, having hit eight-month lows below $6,500 in mid-December. While the bounce is encouraging, the cryptocurrency remains trapped in a six-month-long bearish channel. Thus, the technical bias is still bearish. However, bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment – a measure of how difficult it is to find blocks on the blockchain – indicates the bear market, which began at highs above $13,800 in June 2019, may have bottomed out near $6,500 in December. The mining difficulty fell from 13.7 trillion in November to 13 trillion in December – the first downward adjustment in 12 months – according to data source data.bitcoinity.org. Historically, negative monthly difficulty adjustments have marked major price bottoms, according to popular analyst “Nunya Bizniz.” For instance, the sell-off from the record high just shy of $20,000 seen in December 2017 ran out of steam near $3,100 in December 2018 with the consecutive monthly downward difficulty adjustments at the end of 2018, as seen below (red lines).Going further back, the difficulty dropped from 0.0494 trillion (49.4 giga) in April 2015 to 0.0488 trillion (48.8 giga) in May 2015. Interestingly, bitcoin’s decline from the December 2013 high of $1,153 bottomed out around $200 in April-May 2015. The cryptocurrency traded in a sideways manner for a couple of months before beginning an ascent in October 2015. The peculiar behavior could be explained by monthly declines in difficulty caused by miner capitulation. Note that mining difficulty is adjusted higher or lower every two weeks in correspondence with the amount of the computational power (hash rate) dedicated to mining. The latter is dependent on mining profitability, which is heavily influenced by price. Thus, a monthly mining difficulty decrease is essentially the result of a slide in the hash rate caused by small and marginal miners shutting down operations during sustained market sell-offs and dwindling mining profitability. What’s more, while shutting down operations miners often sell their coins at market price in order to recoup mining losses, accentuating the sell-off. Only when the supply from these miners is absorbed do selling pressures weaken and the cryptocurrency finds a bottom. Meanwhile, remaining miners tend to hold their coins and sell later for profit when prices increase, further decreasing supply in the short term and driving the cryptocurrency higher, Alex Benfield, data analyst at Digital Assets Data told CoinDesk. Also, mining difficulty decreases happen a few months before reward halvings – a process aimed at curbing inflation by cutting rewards per block mined in half every four years. “Reward halvings increase the scarcity of bitcoin,” said Banfield.So, miners who sustained the bear market likely anticipated a price rise on reward halving and held their coins, creating a supply shortage in the short term and driving prices higher. Bitcoin’s 17.48 percent drop in November was caused by miner capitulation, according to market analyst Willy Woo. The argument may have merit because bitcoin fell from $13,800 to $7,500 in three months to September. Such a price drop may have hurt weak miners, forcing capitulation. Interestingly, selling pressures has also ebbed in the last four weeks. Also, the latest downward adjustment in the difficulty happened five months ahead of the reward halving. Therefore, big miners could create a supply shortage in the short term, lifting prices higher. All in all, there is a strong reason to believe bitcoin bottomed out in December with the downward adjustment in difficulty and could regain poise over the coming months. Even so, investors need to observe caution, as noted by Gabor Gurbacs, digital asset strategist and director at VanEck/MVIS. After all, there are additional factors like tax cycles, regulatory actions, cyber security events and derivative expirations that could influence prices significantly.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The percentage of bitcoins lying dormant for over a year is at its highest level since early 2017. “The sheer size of unmoved bitcoin is definitely a sign of the developing community of HODLers,” Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform, told CoinDesk.  The top cryptocurrency witnessed substantial swings last year, rising from $3,693 to $13,879 in the first six months only to fall back to $7,179 by mid-December. Thus, bitcoin just about doubled last year despite the brutal sell-off in the second half. Even so, a large number of bitcoins remained inactive, possibly because investors are expecting a significant price rise following the mining reward halving, due in May. The process, repeated every four years, reduces block rewards by half in order to keep inflation under check. However, if the market doesn’t live up to lofty expectations, some selling could be seen, Stadelmann said. In that case, the sum of bitcoins lying dormant would drop. Another strong reason for the growing number of bitcoins lying dormant could be that a sizable portion of HODLers are doing so at a loss and are holding on to their investments. “Many investors are potentially still underwater with bitcoin that was purchased at higher prices in 2017 and 2018,” said Kevin Kaltenbacher of Digital Assets Data.Prices higher than the 2019 high of $13,879 were observed during the December 2017-February 2018 rally, and many investors may have acquired coins during that bull market frenzy. However, the fact these investors have not sold indicates they are likely betting on long-term growth prospects.

With the surge to multi-month highs,
bitcoin has recovered a significant portion of the ground lost in the second
half of 2019. Bitcoin's bull move from the April 2019 low of $4,100 topped out at $13,880 at the end of June. The bears seized control in July and ended up pushing prices to below $7,000 by the end of November. December, therefore, began on a negative note with prominent analysts calling for a deeper drop to $6,000 or below on miner selling of the digital asset. The decline, however, was cut short at the seven-month low of $6,425 on Dec. 18. Since then the cryptocurrency has risen sharply by more than $3,300.The speed of the ascent has been impressive – nearly 46 percent of the decline from $13,880 to $6,425 seen in the 25 weeks to Dec. 18 has been reversed in just seven weeks. With the bulls in control and momentum looking quite strong, the cryptocurrency could soon rise into five figures. The daily chart looks constructive with the cryptocurrency printing bullish higher highs and higher lows with each passing week. Confirming the uptrend are the ascending five- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) and a bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day MAs. The MACD histogram, meanwhile, is printing higher bars above the zero line, indicating a strengthening of bullish momentum. Importantly, the market is showing no signs of bull fatigue. The 14-day relative strength index is yet to cross into overbought territory above 70 and the cryptocurrency continues to print solid green candles with small wicks, a sign there is no hesitation among buyers while pushing prices higher.So, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to the October high of $10,350. Pullbacks, if any, could find take the support of the ascending five- and 10-day MAs located at $9,526 and $9,445, respectively. Bitcoin has faced rejection near $9,850 two times in the last 24 hours. Another failure might see some buyers opting to take their profits, leading to a minor price pullback to $9,635 (horizontal support line). Acceptance below that level might bring in deeper losses toward $9,500.Disclosure: The author does not currently hold any digital assets.

breakout (bullish reversal) on the weekly chart. The breakout has ...","Jan 13, 2020 at 11:20 UTC","Bitcoin
logged double-digit price gains last week, confirming a reversal from a
six-month downtrend.  ","The top cryptocurrency by market cap gained 11.2 percent in the seven days to Jan. 12, the biggest weekly gain since October, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Prices rallied by 16 percent in the third week of October. Since then, bitcoin has managed to score gains in just three weeks. During the bleak six months to Dec. 31, the cryptocurrency eked out double-digit weekly gains just two times. Further, bitcoin suffered losses in 15 out of 27 weeks, with two weeks ending roughly flat. Clearly, the bears were in control in the second half of 2019. Prices fell from highs above $13,000 to $6,425 during the period, establishing a series of lower highs and lower lows on the weekly chart. That
downward trajectory, however, has ended with last week's 11 percent gain and
the path of least resistance is now on the higher side. Last week's candle closed well above the upper edge of the bearish channel, confirming a bullish breakout. The pattern
indicates the pullback from $13,800 has ended and the bull run from lows near $4,100
seen in the first week of April 2019 has resumed. The 11 percent
rise has also confirmed the bearish-to-bullish trend change signaled by the hammer
candle created in the third week of December. The
activation of twin bullish cues is backed by a rise in buying volumes to the
highest since November. Notably, last week's volume bar violated the descending
trendline, validating the price breakout.The cryptocurrency has also moved back above the bullish ascending 50-week moving average. The odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to $10,350 (October high). A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) below $7,342 would invalidate breakout, although that looks unlikely currently.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,110.With the breakout, the odds of bitcoin repeating history by crossing the 2019 high of $13,880 ahead of the May 2020 mining reward halving have strengthened. Programmed into the blockchain, the halving cuts the amount of bitcoin created every 10 minutes by half. The process is repeated every four years.Historically, bitcoin has hit a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a halving, but before the event, according to popular analyst Rekt Capital.  For instance, bitcoin bottomed out near $150 in January 2015 and rose to a high of $502 in November 2015, confirming a bullish reversal.  Prices then fell back to $365 in February 2016 before hitting a new cycle top $778 in June – a month ahead of the reward halving, which took place in July 2016. Note that the high of $778 reached in June 2016 was the highest price from the bear market low of $150, but was well short of the record high (at the time) of $1,153 reached in December 2013. Similar price action was seen in the 12 months to November 2012, when bitcoin underwent its first reward halving, as noted by Rekt Capital. So, if history
is a guide, bitcoin could clock highs in the range of $13,880 (2019 high) to
$20,000 (record high) before the third halving, due in four months. As for
the next 24 hours, $8,200 is the level to beat for the bulls. A convincing break above $8,200 has remained elusive since Jan. 7. Prices printed a high of $8,463 on Jan. 8 but closed below $8,200. The bulls also failed to secure a daily close above $8,200 on Jan. 11. With the breakout confirmed on the weekly chart, though, bitcoin looks set to scale $8,200 and challenge recent highs above $8,460. Another stronger rejection at or above $8,200 could yield a pullback to $7,667 (Jan. 11 low).  Disclosure: The author does not currently hold any digital assets.

The number one cryptocurrency is currently trading at $7,910 – down 6.5 percent from the seven-week high of $8,463, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).The
pullback began during the U.S. trading hours on Wednesday with gold and other safe
havens losing ground on easing of geopolitical tensions. ""Bitcoin's price dropped down to $8,100 (from $8,300-$8,400 range) right as President Trump announced at 11 a.m. ET that the U.S. will not escalate the conflict with Iran,"" Hong Kim, co-founder and chief technology officer at Bitwise Asset Management tweeted Wednesday. Popular analyst Ran NeuNer also put out a tweet, drawing attention to the fact that both bitcoin and gold moved lower following President Trump's speech. Bitcoin has moved in tandem with gold since Friday.  The cryptocurrency turned higher from lows near $6,850 on Friday after the U.S. attacked Iran and clocked seven-week highs during the Asian trading hours on Wednesday.  During the same time frame, the yellow metal rose from $1,530 to 6.5-year highs above $1,611. So, it appears as though markets are beginning to treat the cryptocurrency as a haven asset, as noted by NeuNer. That makes bitcoin vulnerable to a deeper pullback in gold, which is currently trading at $1,547 per Oz, representing a 4 percent drop from Wednesday's high of $1,611. The
yellow metal could slip further, possibly dragging bitcoin lower, as the
European equities (risk assets) are flashing green and the futures on the
S&P 500 are adding 0.33 percent. That said, bitcoin's short-term bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above key support near $7,600.Bitcoin is flashing red for the second day. However, the former resistance-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders, currently at $7,567, is intact. So,
the bullish breakout confirmed on Jan. 6 is still valid and the path of least resistance
remains to the higher side. Markets usually crowd out weak hands (traders with limited 'HODLing' power) by revisiting former hurdle-turned-support before building on a major breakout. Bitcoin
jumped 5 percent on Tuesday, confirming an upside break of the six-month-long
falling channel. The channel breakout signaled a revival of the bull market
from lows near $4,100 seen in April 2019. Therefore, the 6 percent pullback could be the market's attempt to shake out weak bulls. Also, trading volumes have dropped over the last 18 hours. The price decline is accompanied by a slide in volumes. The red bars, representing selling volumes, have been small compared to the green bars or buying volume witnessed earlier this week. A low-volume price drop is often short-lived. The probability of a slide to the crucial daily chart support of $7,567 would increase if prices find acceptance below the 100-hour average at $7,825 on the back of strong volumes.

","The top cryptocurrency dived out of the $8,460–$8,750 congestion zone during the European trading hours on Thursday, signaling a continuation of the pullback from Sunday's high near $9,200. So far, the follow-through to the range breakdown has been bearish. The cryptocurrency fell to $8,230 soon before press time – the lowest level since Jan. 14, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Notably, bitcoin has now erased nearly 40 percent of the rally from $6,853 to $9,188 witnessed in the 17 days to Jan. 19. Further,
bitcoin is now down 10 percent from the recent high of $9,188 and is reporting
a 3 percent loss on a 24-hour basis. All that said, prices are still up 15 percent on a month-to-date basis. That number, however, could decrease over the next couple of days, as the short-term charts are indicating bearish conditions. Bitcoin fell 3.21 percent on Thursday, its biggest single-day decline in over a month, and closed (UTC) below $8,460, confirming the reversal lower signaled by the big bearish outside day candle created on Jan. 19. The
downturn in price is backed by bearish readings on key indicators. For instance, the MACD histogram is now producing deeper bars below the zero line, a sign of the strengthening of bearish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index has dived below an ascending trendline. All in all, BTC looks set to extend losses toward the psychological support of $8,000. A violation there would expose the 50-day average support at $7,678. The bearish case put forward by Thursday's range breakdown will remain valid as long as prices are held below $8,460, the level which capped downside multiple times in the first half of this week. A bullish revival would require prices to cross $8,750 on strong volumes. That would open the doors for a re-test of recent highs near $9,200.

The big move from multi-month lows warned of an impending reversal of the six-month bearish period – a trend change that was confirmed with last week’s 11 percent price gain. That bullish breakout has been bolstered by Tuesday’s move above $8,463 – passing the resistance of a lower high created on Jan. 8.As a result, the next major resistance – the 200-day moving average (MA) located at $9,100 – could soon come into play. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $8,710, representing a 1.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. While prices have pulled back from Tuesday’s high of $8,900, the technical charts suggest it's nothing more than a temporary correction. Bitcoin rose more than 8 percent and closed well above $8,463 on Tuesday. The breakout above the lower high was accompanied by the strongest buying volumes (green bar) since Nov. 25, according to Bitstamp data. Volumes also rose sharply on major exchanges including Bitfinex and Coinbase, which are included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real 10” bitcoin trading volume listing along with Bitstamp. As a result, further gains could be in the offing, more so as there are no signs of overbought conditions. The 14-day relative strength index is yet to cross into overbought territory above 70.00. Further, bullish momentum is looking strong with the five- and 10-day averages sloping upwards. In the six hours to 05:00 UTC, trading volumes dipped as the cryptocurrency pulled back from $8,900 to $8,555. A low-volume price drop is often short-lived. The RSI has also realigned in favor of the bulls as opposed to above-70 readings seen 24 hours ago. All in all, bitcoin looks set to pass the psychological resistance of $9,000 and test the 200-day MA at $9,100 in the short-term. A UTC close above the
200-day MA would expose key resistances located at $9,400 and $10,350. Popular analyst Josh Rager expects a potential break above $10,350 to set the tone for a major bull run for months to come. The cryptocurrency reversed sharply lower from $10,350 in October, so a move past that resistance could attract keener buying. The short-term bullish view would be invalidated if prices find acceptance under Tuesday's low of $8,105. That level could come into play if the cryptocurrency breaches the former hurdle-turned-support of $8,463 on the back of strong volumes.

Meanwhile, a crossover below zero is taken as a sign of bearish reversal. Further, consecutive higher bars above the zero line indicate a strengthening of bullish momentum and back-to-back deeper bars below the zero line indicate a bearish trend is developing. Seasoned traders would argue the MACD is a lagging indicator, as it's based on moving averages and the upcoming bullish crossover could end up trapping buyers on the wrong side of the market, as it did in 2018. The histogram crossed above zero in September 2018, signaling a bullish reversal.  That, however, failed to inspire the bulls and the cryptocurrency remained sidelined above $6,000 for the next five weeks before falling sharply to below $5,000 in mid-November. Essentially, the MACD's bullish cross turned out to be a bull trap. However, back then, the broader market conditions were bearish. The cryptocurrency had charted a series of lower highs since topping out at $20,000 in December 2017.  The situation is quite different so far in 2020.The sell-off from the July 2019 high of $13,880 ran out of steam near $6,400 in mid-December and the cryptocurrency has been better bid ever since.  More importantly, bitcoin broke out of a falling channel two weeks ago, indicating a resumption of the rally from the April 2019 low of $4,100. Additionally, the historically price-bullish mining reward halving (a bitcoin supply cut) is due in May. As a result, the MACD’s impending move above the zero could bolster the bullish setup, strengthening the case for a rise to the high of $10,350 reached in October. As for the next 24 hours, the Jan. 19 low of $8,461 is the level to beat for the bears. Bitcoin is trapped in a sideways channel on the four-hour chart. A move below $8,461 would imply a range breakdown and open the doors for an extension of the pullback from Sunday’s high of $9,188 toward key support at $8,200 and $8,000.It's worth noting that $8,461 is also the low of the bearish outside-day candle created on Jan. 19. So, a move below that level would validate bullish exhaustion signaled by the candle and invite stronger selling pressure. On the higher side, acceptance above the channel resistance at $8,750 would shift the focus to $9,000.At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,640 on Bitstamp.

The number has more than doubled since early 2015. ""The steady rise is the result of accumulation by retail buyers,"" according to Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data in Denver.Address growth can also come from exchanges and big players, known as  “whales,” though such addresses usually hold large balances and often rank at the top of bitcoin’s ""rich list,” a table of the addresses holding the most bitcoins.For instance, three of the top five addresses on the rich list, published by bitinfocharts.com, belong to prominent exchanges Huobi, Bitfinex and Binance. Topping that list is Huobi's cold wallet, currently holding 255,502 BTC. Meanwhile, the number of addresses with balances between 0.1 BTC and 1 BTC have also risen by 10 percent year over year. These small balances, however, are may be residuals from large transactions or holdings of one time users. ""The rising number of addresses accumulating greater amounts of BTC is a sign that adoption as a store of value is increasing,"" said Connor Abendschein, analyst at Digital Assets Data. Retail accumulation, as represented by the growth in the number of addresses with one or more coins, has remained solid over the years despite price gyrations. Bitcoin prices rose from $3,600 to $13,880 in the first six months of 2019 before falling to $6,430 in December. Even so, the number of addresses with one or more bitcoins rose by 77,000  in 12 months. This type of investor behavior is seen in the gold market. The yellow metal, a classic safe haven asset with a strong store of value appeal, generally finds takers across the globe regardless of the short-term price trends. Yet, many observers, including the likes of billionaire investor and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, are of the opinion that bitcoin is simply too volatile to become a proper alternative as a store of value.""Address balances are a good proxy for potential unique users,” Yassine Elmandjra, crypto asset analyst at ARK Invest, told CoinDesk. “The growth in unique BTC addresses suggests a continued increase in BTC’s wealth distribution.”The market, however, is still dominated by whales. As of December, investors with 1,000 to 1 million bitcoins held 42.1 percent of the total supply compared to 37.9 percent seen during the bull market frenzy of late 2017. Also, the rise in the number of unique addresses does not necessarily mean an influx of new investors into the market. After all, a single investor can hold 1,000 BTC in 1,000 addresses or more, so the metric has its limits. Thus the rise in the number of addresses with a balance of one or more bitcoins does not necessarily imply increased participation in the market. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Even so, the bias remains bullish with support near $8,460 still intact. ","The top cryptocurrency by market value ran past the 200-day average at $9,040 during Sunday’s Asian trading hours, raising prospects of a rise to the next major resistance at $9,400. The ascent, however, was cut short near $9,200 and prices fell sharply by 8 percent to $8,461, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  The majority of the drop occurred around 23:00 UTC. Since then, the cryptocurrency has been largely confined to a trading range of $8,460 to $8,750. With the sharp pullback from near $9,200, bitcoin engulfed the price action seen in the previous four trading days. This type of market action after a notable rally or at multi-month highs is indicative of temporary bullish exhaustion. What matters now is the survival of $8,461 – the level at which the pullback looks to have halted in the last 20 hours. The same level saw bitcoin turn lower on Jan. 8. Acceptance under that key support would confirm
bullish exhaustion and terminate the short-term uptrend. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $8,640,
representing a 4 percent slide on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin charted a big bearish outside day candle on Sunday. These occur when the day begins with optimism but ends on a negative note, engulfing preceding day’s price action. While the pattern is considered a bearish
signal, traders usually wait for confirmation in the form of follow-through,
preferably a move below the low of the candle. Should Sunday’s low of $8,461 be breached, chart-driven selling could gather pace, yielding a deeper drop to last Tuesday’s low of $8,104. However, if the support holds ground, the bulls will likely have scope to inch back toward the 200-day average, currently at $9,027.Bitcoin has dived out of the ascending trendline rising from Jan. 3 and Jan. 10 lows in favor of the bears. The pullback looks to have legs as the breakdown was backed by the highest selling volume (red bar) since Dec. 16. So, a drop through the support at $8,461 can't be ruled out. That would expose the next support located at $8,200 (horizontal line) and the psychological level of $8,000.Bitcoin jumped 6 percent last week, cementing the breakout from the long-term descending channel kicked off by the preceding week’s 11 percent gain. Further, the 5- and 10-week averages have produced a bullish crossover and the MACD histogram is about to cross over to bullish territory above zero. With the longer duration chart reporting bullish conditions, any dip to $8,200 or lower, may be short-lived. The cryptocurrency will remain on track to test October’s high of $10,350, as long as the channel breakout is valid.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average cemented a 1.6 percent loss on Jan. 28 while the S&P 500 index also saw a sharp decline, down 1.5 percent.Both indices are posting modest gains in after-hours trading as they attempt to correct yesterday's selloff.

opened the doors for a move to $10,000. The weekly charts are also ...","Jan 29, 2020 at 11:30 UTC",Bitcoin appears set to register its best January price gain in seven years and could soon rise into five figures. ,"The top cryptocurrency by market cap is currently trading at $9,350 – a hefty 30 percent gain from the opening price of $7,160 observed on Jan. 1, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. If the gain is held through Jan. 31, it would be the best starting month to a year since 2013. Back in January 2013, bitcoin had rallied by 54 percent. From 2015 to 2019, bitcoin has posted losses in January. The cryptocurrency now looks certain to snap that losing streak. The 30 percent rally is the second-best January performance on record. Bitcoin picked up a strong bid at lows near $6,850 in the first week of this month and rose past $8,000, exiting a six-month-long downtrend. Notably, the breakout happened as the U.S. and Iran came close to war, forcing the analyst community to take note of the cryptocurrency's strengthening safe-haven appeal. Since then, we've seen a textbook bull move: a steady uptrend with regular low-volume pullbacks testing dip demand. The price rise is in line with historical data showing the cryptocurrency hits a new market cycle top (the highest point from the preceding bear market low) in the calendar year of a miner reward halving, but before the event, as discussed earlier this month. With history looking to repeat itself, a further rise to levels above the June 2019 $13,880 before the May 2020 halving (supply-cutting event) cannot be ruled out. For now, the technical charts do indicate scope for a move above the psychological resistance of $10,000.The falling channel breakout confirmed in the first week of January validated a bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-week moving averages (MAs) and opened the doors for a test of resistance at $10,350 (October high). Supporting the bullish case are the ascending five- and 10-week MAs.Additionally, the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change, while the relative strength index is on an upward trajectory and is reporting bullish conditions with an above-50 reading.Bitcoin printed a UTC close above $9,188 (Jan. 19 high) on Tuesday, establishing a fresh higher high and signaling a continuation of the rally from the Jan. 3 low of $6,850. More importantly, the move saw bitcoin cross the 200-day moving average (MA) with a positive ""marubozu candle,"" which comprises of little or no wicks and a strong body. The candle indicates buyers remained in control during the 24-hour period and the cryptocurrency closed near the high point of the day. While bitcoin did see a minor pullback to $8.870 during the U.S. trading hours, the dip only ended up recharging the bulls for a strong move higher. The positive marubozu candle indicates that bullish sentiment is strong – more so, in this case, as it shows buyers stepped without any hesitation despite prices trading close to 200-day MA, which acted as stiff resistance on Jan. 19. Some investors may point out that bitcoin's break above the 200-day MA in October turned out to be a bull trap. But back then the overall market sentiment was bearish, with the cryptocurrency trapped in a bearish channel on the weekly chart. Overall, the broader trend is bullish, as noted. The stage now looks set for a quick move into five figures. Pullbacks cannot be ruled out, though, and the case for a quick rise to $10,000 would weaken if prices fall back below the 200-day MA at $8,894 on the back of a spike in trading volumes. The weekly chart will continue to paint a bullish picture as long as prices are holding above $8,000. Disclosure: The author does not currently hold any digital assets.

U.S. stocks fell on the news as investors worried the conflict between the two nations might escalate into a prolonged and damaging war. For some market analysts and investors, bitcoin’s rally served to underscore the digital asset’s perceived value as a hedge against inflation, historically an economic consequence of major wars. Oil prices jumped in the aftermath of the killing, given Iran’s status as one of the world’s major producers, potentially a harbinger of higher gasoline costs at the pump for U.S. consumers.  “Acts of violence and war can create inflation and have demonstrated that in the past,” said Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of Digital Asset Research, which analyzes crypto markets. So heightened violence now could portend higher demand for bitcoin, he said, adding a major caveat: “To the extent that bitcoin is a hedge against inflation.”In traditional investing, a safe haven asset is one where the price typically rises when traders are fearful of increasing risk, or in the face of convulsing stock markets; money is pulled from riskier assets and shifted into “safer” like gold or U.S. Treasuries, expected to be a more reliable store of value.  One theory among bitcoin investors is that while the cryptocurrency lacks gold’s luster or long track record as a store of value, it shares the key property of being difficult to mine; the supply of new bitcoin is strictly regulated by its 11-year-old original programming code.   What’s more, some bitcoin advocates note the private data addresses, or “keys,” needed to spend the cryptocurrency would theoretically be far more portable than gold bars in a tumultuous, war-torn or even simply hyperinflation-racked world.  But even among fully committed crypto traders, it remains an open debate as to whether bitcoin actually trades like a safe-haven asset. Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, which specializes in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, emailed clients a chart from the data provider CoinMetrics showing the correlation between bitcoin and gold - accepted by most investors as a traditional hedge against inflation -   had recently swung from negative to positive. But in a follow-up exchange with CoinDesk, Greenspan said the correlation looks “weak.”“It’s not a very strong correlation at all,” according to Greenspan. Based on data compiled by CoinMetrics, the correlation coefficient over a one-year time period between gold and bitcoin is now a mere 0.15, up from -0.04 back in May 2018. In the case of Iran, there’s speculation locals might try to shift money into bitcoin to shield their wealth from inflation. That might occur as the country becomes more economically isolated from global finance.Even Iran’s leaders are contemplating using cryptocurrency as a way to offset pressure from sanctions. In late December, President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech in Malaysia that Muslims need their own cryptocurrency to “save themselves from the domination of the U.S. dollar and the American financial regime.”    Michael Novogratz, CEO of the investment firm Galaxy Digital and one of the most closely watched investors in the crypto space, tweeted Sunday that the “the more I analyze this Iranian situation,” the more bullish the case becomes for gold and bitcoin. “Mideast less stable,” Novogratz tweeted. “Equals more volatility.” In an email to clients on Friday, Ryan Selkis of the data provider Messari acknowledged some of the most hyperinflationary periods of modern history occurred around the end of major violent conflicts like World Wars I and II and the Cold War.However, Selkis argues bitcoin is a “risk asset” and would be among the first things investors liquidate “in the event of an uptick in global economic and regulatory uncertainty.”“That cyclical pain could be exacerbated by further crackdowns on the industry,” Selkis wrote.  Not all cryptocurrency observers are convinced tensions with Iran have anything to do with the recent rally. Adam Vettese, U.K. market analyst for trading platform eToro, noted Monday in an email that while some market observers say the recent rally “affirms bitcoin’s status as a safe haven,” the price reaction might have simply been “a technical move off support at $7,000.” That means the price was essentially just bouncing off a perceived price floor of $7,000, as determined by traders scrutinizing price charts for patterns, using a subjective practice known as technical analysis.“There’s no way” the term safe haven applies “in the same sense as gold,” according to Vettese. “Cryptoassets in general are considered high risk and therefore such a description is a contradiction in itself.”   The safest bet is this debate in the bitcoin market won’t be settled anytime soon.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

That’s the lowest level since November 2016 and comes after topping out at 58,925 at the end of June 2019, according to crypto analytics firm Glassnode. The number has since inched up to 27,289 as of Feb. 4.Notably, the count of deposits dropped by 60 percent in the second half of 2019 even as prices collapsed from $13,800 to $6,425. During violent price drops, investors usually move their coins to exchanges to sell them in the market. However, investors held onto their coins during the second half of 2019 despite the price slide. It indicates increased “HODLing,” a sign of strengthening belief in the long-term viability of the cryptocurrency, according to Ashish Singhal, CEO and co-founder at CRUXPay and CoinSwitch.co. “HODLers are not in it for a ‘get rich quick’ mentality and are now less fazed by micro factors that previously led to an exodus or panic sell,” Singhal told CoinDesk. Nicholas Pelecanos, advisor to NEM Ventures, sees the slowdown in trading and on-chain transaction volumes as indicative of a not-so-healthy market in the short-term.“A divergence between on-chain transaction volume and price appreciation has typically been a bearish signal,” Pelecanos told CoinDesk.  Bitcoin’s price rallied by 30 percent in January, diverging higher from the the count of transfers to exchange addresses, which remained near multi-year lows hit on Jan. 1. Although the number of transfers to exchanges declined, the number of transactions recently saw an upswing along with price. The seven-day average of transactions jumped rose from 290,200 on Jan. 6 to a three-month high of 324,745 on Feb. 3.That investors hoarded coins in January amid a price rally suggests strong bullish sentiment among investors; if they had doubted the sustainability of the recent price gains, they would have moved their coins to exchanges to sell them at market price, leading to a rise in exchange deposits. Bitcoin will undergo mining reward halving in May 2020. The process aims to curb inflation by reducing rewards per block mined by 50 percent. When it occurs, the block rewards will drop to 6.25 BTC from the current 12.5 BTC. Bitcoin has picked up a bid ahead of the supply-cutting event. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $9,400, representing a 46 percent gain on December’s low of $6,425. Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, expects exchange deposits to rise should the price of the cryptocurrency continue to do so ahead of the halving and in the following months. That’s because some investors may decide to book profits, he said.  The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

At the current price of $9,350, bitcoin is up 30 percent on a month-to-date basis – its best January performance since 2013. Additionally, the cryptocurrency is on track to register a double-digit monthly gain for the first time since June 2019, when prices had rallied by 26 percent. January’s 30 percent rally is its best monthly performance since May 2019.This month's rally marks a sharp reversal higher from a six-month downturn when prices collapsed from $13,880 to $6,425. With the bulls still leading the price action, February may again turn out to be a good month for the cryptocurrency. The popular narrative for February's good record is Chinese investors tend to liquidate their crypto holdings ahead of the New Year holiday in January and reinvest in February, causing prices to rise. This time, however, the supposed post-holiday reinvestments may be delayed due to coronavirus outbreak, leading to a weakening of the bullish momentum. That said, the bitcoin market is currently showing no signs of bull fatigue. “It's difficult to have a bearish argument,” popular trader and analyst @filbfilb tweeted on Thursday. The analyst is drawing attention to the monthly chart, where the MACD histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. The bullish bias will strengthen if prices print a monthly close (Friday, UTC) above $9,158, establishing a higher high. The shorter duration charts are also reporting a strong bullish bias. Bitcoin has broken out of a falling channel, indicating a resumption of the rally from lows near $4,100 observed in early April 2019. The breakout is backed by bullish readings on both the MACD histogram and the relative strength index. The weekly chart is aligned in favor of a rally toward $10,350 (October high).While the daily candle is red, the losses may be reversed later today as the odds are stacked in favor of the bulls. Bitcoin defended the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188 on Thursday with a bullish engulfing candle. That solidified the preceding day’s breakout above that level and signaled a continuation of the rally from $8,213 (Jan. 24 low). Momentum is still strong, as suggested by the ascending five- and 10-day averages. The cryptocurrency could test and possibly break above resistance at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) and rise toward $10,000 over the next few days. The RSI has produced lower highs or bearish divergence on the four-hour chart. As a result, a quick pullback to $9,000 cannot be ruled out before the move into five figures suggested by the daily and weekly charts. The bias will remain bullish as long as prices are holding above $8,213. The odds of bitcoin falling all the way back to levels below $8,000 are quite low, according to renowned analyst Josh Rager.

Buyers, however, absorbed the selling pressure at $9,188, keeping the former resistance-turned-support intact. Bitcoin had reversed lower from the same $9,188 hurdle on Jan. 14, aborting the short-term bullish view. So as the cryptocurrency bounced up strongly from $8,250 earlier this week, traders wondered whether bitcoin will again fail at $9,188 and form a double-top bearish reversal pattern or cross the hurdle with conviction.The latter case won the day and the bulls managed to push prices well above $9,188 on Wednesday, flipping the resistance into support and establishing a new higher high. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,350, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin is moving in a sideways channel on the hourly chart. A move above channel resistance at $9,452 would likely accelerate the recent rally and open the doors to $9,600 (channel range added to breakout price). A violation there would expose the psychological resistance at $10,000.The RSI is no longer reporting overbought conditions and is currently in bullish territory above 50. With the longer duration charts also biased bullish, the odds appear stacked in favor of a range breakout. Should the range be breached to the downside, a deeper pullback to the 200-day average at $8,900 may be seen.   BItcoin rose past $9,188 on Wednesday with a positive ""marubozu candle,"" indicating that bullish sentiment is quite strong.Further, the five- and 10-day averages are trending north so dips, if any, are likely to be short-lived.A bearish reversal would be confirmed only if prices print a UTC close below $8,213 (higher low created on Jan. 24).

Tether's treasury website currently reads a value of $4,776,470,463.76 in total assets, securing $4,656,898,280.75 of liabilities.However, archived versions of the page show similar readings over the past few days, suggesting CoinMarketCap's data did not capture the full supply previously. USDT runs on several different blockchain networks, including Omni, ethereum, Tron and Liquid.  Traders can deposit U.S. dollars with Tether Ltd., the issuer of USDT, and receive the stablecoin in return. Since USDT is pegged 1:1 to the dollar and is used to move money quickly between crypto exchanges, a swelling of its market cap could have been interpreted as an increase in demand for digital assets. It remains unclear, then, exactly why bitcoin jumped late Monday. Talks surrounding BTC’s use case as a safe haven asset are dominating investor channels amid the backdrop of the Iran/US tensions that have been ongoing since Jan. 3.  At the time of writing the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is up 0.25 percent while the S&P 500 (SPX) is up 0.35 percent. Crude oil (USOIL) has taken a small hit and is down 0.35 percent so the narrative of BTC being a safe haven asset during times of uncertainty remains unclear at this stage.

The surge, which appeared to follow gains in oil and gold prices, pushed bitcoin into positive territory for the year-to-date, now up 2.2 percent.Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency-focused research firm Quantum Economics, noted in an email that the U.S. attack drove up prices for gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset whose value is expected to hold in times of geopolitical or economic instability. Many investors speculate that bitcoin bears similarities to gold, in terms of its perceived resistance to inflation. Higher oil prices could make investors nervous about future economic growth while also potentially pushing up consumers’ costs at the gas pump, stoking faster inflation. Another consideration is whether the escalating tension might spur demand for bitcoin among Iranians, who have shown an appetite for cryptocurrencies in recent years as the Middle Eastern economy faced a host of sanctions ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. In late December, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech in Malaysia that Muslims might need their own cryptocurrency to “save themselves from the domination of the U.S. dollar and the American financial regime.”    Iran has “long been seen as one of the hotbeds for bitcoin adoption” due to U.S. sanctions on money transfers stemming from the country, not to mention a “very unstable economy,” according to Greenspan. But the news likely precipitated purchase orders from some investors who were already planning to buy bitcoin, Greenspan wrote. “The Iranian market in and of itself is likely too small and slow to have caused this move single-handedly,” according to Greenspan. “More likely, one or several players have been waiting on the side for a good buying opportunity below $7,000 per coin, and it seems one has presented itself.”Bitcoin prices surged 94 percent in 2019, making it one of the world’s best-performing assets, with roughly triple the total return charted by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A UTC close below that level would invalidate an inverse ...","Jan 10, 2020 at 11:00 UTC","Bitcoin is flashing red for the third straight day, with a major portion of the recent price gains now erased. ","After a drop back to below $7,800, the cryptocurrency has erased nearly 45 percent of the rise from $6,850 to $8,463 witnessed in the six days to Jan. 8, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. At press time, the biggest cryptocurrency by market value is currently changing hands near $7,757, representing a 1.5 percent drop from the day's opening price (UTC) of $7,875. Bitcoin shed 1.4 percent and 2.9 percent on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. The cryptocurrency did show signs of life with a move higher from $7,780 to $8,000 during the early U.S. trading hours on Thursday. However, the bulls lost momentum near the $8,000 psychological resistance and the minor bounce was quickly reversed. The rejection likely invited stronger selling pressure, yielding a drop to a low of $7,676 earlier today. Looking
forward, a deeper drop to key support below $7,600 cannot be ruled out. Bitcoin has dived out of an ascending trendline on the hourly chart, violating the bullish higher -lows pattern. Further, it has found acceptance under the widely-tracked 100-hour average, with the relative strength index (RSI) reporting bearish conditions below 50. Bitcoin created a spinning top candle on Wednesday, signaling indecision in the market place.That ended with bears coming out victorious, as indicated by Thursday's 2.9 percent drop. Put simply, the odds of a slide to $7,555 – a former hurdle-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline – have increased over the last 24 hours. The breakout, however, would be invalidated only if BTC prints a UTC close above $7,555.As seen on the four-hour chart, selling volumes, as represented by the red bars, have dropped throughout the pullback from $8,463 to $7,700.A
low-volume pullback is often short-lived. Hence, the bears need to observe
caution despite signs of weakness in the hourly and daily charts. A move above $8,000, a level that acted as a strong hurdle on Thursday, will imply an end of the pullback and will likely yield a re-test of recent highs above $8,400.

“doji” candle. The case for a notable pullback will strengthen if prices ...","Jan 16, 2020 at 11:00 UTC","The bitcoin market is
telling a tale of bullish exhaustion with indecisive price action following a
rise to the highest point since November. ","The top cryptocurrency witnessed two-way business on Wednesday. Prices rose from lows near $8,550 seen during the Asian trading hours to a two-month high of $8,903, only to end the day (UTC) on a flat note at $8,808, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Essentially, bitcoin created
a “doji” candle, which is widely considered a sign of indecision in the
marketplace.In this case, however, the candle could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion, as it has appeared following a sharp rally from $6,850 to $8,900 and suggests the indecision is predominantly among the bulls.The price action seen so far today is telling the same story. The cryptocurrency fell from $8,800 to $8,575 during the Asian trading hours and has struggled to chart a strong bounce ever since. This is in contrast to the quick reversals from sub-$8,600 levels seen in the previous two days. At press time, bitcoin is trading near $8,600, representing a one percent drop on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin now risks a deeper pullback below Wednesday’s low of $8,555. A drop through that support would validate buyer exhaustion signaled by the doji candle (above left), attracting selling pressure. It would also confirm a double-top breakdown on the hourly chart (above right). That would open the doors for $8,210 (target as per the measured move method). That said, the short-term outlook would turn bearish only if any pullback ends up violating the bullish higher low of $7,667 created Jan. 10.That, however, looks unlikely with the five- and 10-day averages continuing to trend north. These averages, currently located at $8,508 and $8,276, respectively, tend to reverse pullbacks when they are on an upward trajectory.  Further, the longer duration charts have recently turned bullish. Wednesday’s high of $8,903
will likely come into play if prices violate the lower high of $8,705 seen on
the hourly chart in the next few hours. A break above $8,900, a level that has acted as strong resistance in the last 48 hours, would likely invite stronger buying pressure, yielding a quick move to the 200-day average at $9,100.Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

its recent trading range, opening the doors for a pullback to deeper support
levels. ","The top cryptocurrency ran into offers around $8,580 at 08:35 UTC and fell through the long-held support of $8,460 in a few minutes to hit a low of $8,340 – a level last seen on Jan. 14, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  The drop to nine-day lows confirmed a downside break of the recent trading range of $8,460 to $8,750. The cryptocurrency had entered consolidation mode during Sunday’s U.S. trading hours after the sudden reversal lower from highs near $9,200 range out of steam at $8,460 – the level, which saw bitcoin turn lower on Jan. 8.So it seems safe to say the pullback from $9,200 has resumed with the range breakdown and a deeper drop to support at $8,200 and $8,000 could be in the offing. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $8,415, representing a 2.72 percent drop on a 24-hour basis. The range breakdown has created room for a drop to at least $8,170 (target as per the measured move method). Bitcoin charted multiple four-hour candles with highs around $8,200 in the Jan. 11-13 period. As a result, $8,200 is a key support to watch out for. On similar lines, the psychological level of $8,000 is also crucial support. On the higher side, $8,750 is the level to beat for the bulls. A sustained move at that level would revive the short-term bullish view and allow a re-test of recent highs near $9,200.However, a break above $8,750 looks unlikely, as the short-term indicators have made a bearish shift. The MACD histogram, which is widely used to gauge trend strength and trend reversals, has crossed below zero, confirming a bullish-to-bearish trend change. The five- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) have produced bearish crossover. Bitcoin has lost its upward trajectory, as indicated by the ""ascending pitchfork"" breakdown. The ascending pitchfork is a trend channel tool consisting of a median line in the center with two parallel equidistant lines on either side. These lines are drawn by from three points, representing a bottom, a correction high and a higher low. All in all, the odds
appear stacked in favor of a drop to $8,200 and possibly to $8,000.Bitcoin broke out of a six-month-long falling channel two weeks ago, confirming a long-term bullish reversal.

The 1994 Times report described the web as “already showing signs of suffering from its own success, as crowds compete for access to popular databases.” Yet, people were already starting to think about subscription paywalls for content distribution. Industry insiders were so bullish on the commercial potential that in the December 1995 issue of Wired magazine, Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy predicted the rise of “disposable word processors and spreadsheets” priced per use and delivered via Java software. Within the first decade it was clear the internet could be used for commerce, interpersonal communications, marketing and education. There were established companies using it to turn a modest profit. Blockstream alumnus and founder of the Blockchain Commons, Christopher Allen, said he is “concerned” about the lack of bitcoin adoption at this stage, which is why he is so optimistic about scaling solutions like the lightning network. “Lightning does have the potential to be where you buy your steak and bread,” Allen said. “Until you buy your bread or steak with bitcoin, you’re going to have to convert to some other currency, no matter how good it is as a censorship-resistant medium.”  To be fair, cryptocurrency has already proven its usefulness through cross-border collaboration. For example, the Decred treasury has distributed roughly $3.5 million worth of cryptocurrency to more than 60 contributors, according to the community’s press representative. Roughly 30 percent of these contributors hail from Latin America and 15 percent are from Africa, a more global distribution than comparable Silicon Valley startups. Even so, such experiments are a far cry from the “mainstream adoption” many fans predict bitcoin will undergo in becoming a global, self-sustaining currency.Bitcoin may be behind the internet’s timeline in terms of commercial use cases, but it has already achieved comparable social functions.By 2001, the New York Times was describing internet services like email as a platform for relationship-building with former coworkers and classmates, while startups pioneered video and music streaming services. One such Yahoo group reportedly included 600 people “exchanging hundreds of messages a month about the bankruptcy proceedings, health insurance and the fate of their retirement plans.” This may be comparable to crypto communities today, which rely on forums, GitHub and social networking platforms like Twitter. According to Allen, who focused earlier in his career on core internet protocols, the internet was also designed to offer more freedom of choice to the users – even though, through big-tech consolidation, the industry eventually failed to reach that vision. Zcash co-creator and Electric Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox agreed that the early software projects he worked on were supposed to offer “freedom” and “end wars,” because people would just talk things out over the internet.Wilcox said, looking back at his time in the 1990s working on bitcoin’s predecessor, Digicash, that he idealistically underestimated the importance of economic incentives.  “What I would tell myself, if I could use a time machine, it just being compatible [with commercial use] isn’t good enough,” Wilcox said. “This was a fatal flaw in the overall design of the [open software] movement, that is relied on ongoing volunteers or donations. It didn’t have a built-in economic feedback loop.”Listen to Leigh's full interview with Zooko WilcoxIn this regard, bitcoin has a great track record during this first decade. Yet, it remains to be seen if bitcoin’s ecosystem provides a self-sustaining model.Some coders believe early advocacy for strong legal frameworks that protect freedom, coupled with forward-thinking precautions, could help the decentralized “Web3” avoid or minimize early mistakes.“Protocols would have a lot of flexibility in terms of what types of security you need, etc., and along the way we ended up creating the central Certificate Authority (CAs) business … not quite realizing that 20 years later all the CAs all got consolidated,” Allen said. “We were supposed to be able to choose which CA we trusted. Centralization crops up in odd ways.”Marco Peereboom, a Dell alumnus and Linux veteran who is also currently the Decred community’s New Systems Development Lead, agreed with Allen that the internet was built by idealistic young men who wanted to “uplift humanity.” (Not unlike crypto adherents today.) “I’m extremely disappointed with where we are today,” Peereboom said. “The amount of snooping the government is doing, I didn’t anticipate. … More cryptography early on would have done the internet a lot of good, and more advocacy as well.”   Along these lines, Allen is focused on work related to user-friendly-yet-secure key management and blockchain identity standards. Meanwhile, Peereboom is working to refine Decred’s open source funding experiments, which is how he earns a salary today. Much like the altcoin project Dash, Decred pays freelancers through public votes and grants collected from the network itself. Plus, Decred developers can earn money anonymously based on the merits of their contributions.  “Until the internet moves away from the ad-sponsored model, it will only get worse,” Peereboom said, referring to potential surveillance and corporate dominance via upcoming Web3 models.“I think anonymous payments are a must-have feature for any cryptocurrency to be around,” he said. “I hope I’m not making the same mistake twice. But I really do believe cryptocurrencies have the potential to change the world.”From the perspective of veteran bitcoiners like Peereboom, many of whom are now focused on altcoin projects, bitcoin’s weakness is how difficult it is to update the software. He said there must be a middle ground between constant changes and nearly impossible changes.   “Writing bug-free software just doesn’t happen,” Peereboom said. “You need a mechanism to deal with consensus changes.Plus, bitcoiners like Peereboom and Wilcox are both prioritizing the privacy-enhancing aspects of cryptocurrency. Is it possible for governance mechanisms to resist centralization over several decades? That’s what Wilcox is trying to figure out. “It would be dishonest and overselling to tell people this is inevitable,” Wilcox said. He added Linux failed, in his opinion, because the movement “redefined success” to match corporate adoption rather than broader social change. As larger institutions profit from or leverage bitcoin, just like with the internet, the risks to users’ personal freedoms increase.“There’s going to be a lot of challenges along the way, and harm. I’d like to mitigate the harm as much as possible,” Allen concluded. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Forward. Jan 24, 2020 at 00:45 UTC Updated Jan 24, 2020 at 15:38 UTC.","Jan 24, 2020 at 00:45 UTC",A privacy and scalability upgrade that could turn out to be one of bitcoin's largest to date has passed a couple of milestones that were little noticed outside technical circles. ,"On Tuesday, Pieter Wuille, a Bitcoin Core contributor and the brains behind the update known as Taproot, submitted a work-in-progress code change to GitHub in what's known as a ""pull request,"" showing the code is ready for more developer eyes. ""Merging this is obviously conditional on getting community support for the proposal. It's opened here to demonstrate the code changes that it would imply,"" he wrote.Submitting a pull request to the code for Bitcoin Core (the reference implementation, or standard version of bitcoin software from which others are derived) does not mean the change is official. But it's a key step. While many in the bitcoin community are excited about the upgrade, the process of turning the idea into code has been mostly happening behind-the-scenes. Wuille's ""pull request"" pushes it into the spotlight, signifying the code is closer to ready.Though Wuille submitted the pull request just a couple of days ago, several bitcoin developers, including John Newberry, Ben Woosley and Adam Ficsor, have already left review comments, in another sign of how highly anticipated the change is. In another key, if more symbolic milestone, the three Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIP), which are like blueprints of the changes, have also been assigned numbers on GitHub.A key part of the proposal is Schnorr, a cryptographic signature scheme for proving ownership of coins. It's better than what bitcoin has right now in that it paves the way for scalability improvements and allows developers to build new technologies on top of bitcoin. Using Schnorr, Taproot adds smart contract capabilities to bitcoin that would strengthen privacy. For example, the transactions that open and close payment channels on the lightning network, allowing speedier transfers of small amounts, would not look much different from normal transactions (at least, up to a point). So it would be harder for blockchain voyeurs to discern what a user is doing.As a decentralized cryptocurrency, bitcoin doesn't have a single leader who can push through changes. As such, a major change like this (called a ""soft fork"" in bitcoin) can only get absorbed if just about everyone agrees with it. If no one in the community comes up with any valid objections to Taproot (such as uncovering a security vulnerability) it could become the biggest change the digital currency has seen since 2017, when scaling upgrade SegWit was locked in after a long and often savage debate. So far, it looks like the change has all but unanimous approval from developers. Bitcoin Core contributor Anthony Towns organized a review group where developers scrutinized the BIPs, submitting comments and suggestions. Any developer who wanted to join could.This ""army"" of developers finished their review of the protocol change earlier this month. Of those, 16 submitted a ""survey"" at the end outlining their feedback, including whether they think the upgrade is a good idea. All 16 approved of the changes.There's still a lot of work to do. While many scrutinize the code looking for improvements or errors, some developers are debating the best way for the decentralized, global network to adopt the change with as few bumps as possible – which SegWit's heated debate showed is far from a given.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, the breakout above the lateral resistance of $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) was short-lived and the cryptocurrency ended the day (UTC) on a flat note at $9,288. Put simply, the day began with optimism but ended on a pessimistic note, with buyers failing to establish a strong foothold above price resistance. This type of price action at multi-month highs and after significant rallies is indicative of bull fatigue and often precedes a reversal. Bitcoin is feeling the pull of gravity at press time. The cryptocurrency is currently trading below the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188 (Jan. 19 high). The global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index, is seen at $9,170 – down 1.5 percent on a 24-hour basis. Bitcoin created a classic doji candle with a long upper shadow on Monday, marking a bull failure at $9,586 (Nov. 4 high) and aborting the immediate bullish view. The five-day moving average has topped out and is beginning to trend south, indicating a temporary bearish shift in momentum.The MACD histogram is producing smaller bars above the zero line – also a sign of ebbing of bullish momentum. Monday’s rejection above $9,200 reinforced the lower highs, or bearish divergence, of the RSI. Additionally, the RSI has now dipped into bearish territory below 50 and the negative bars on the MACD histogram are indicating a downside move is about to gather steam. Bitcoin risks falling to the 200-day average, currently located at $8,867. A UTC close lower could cause more sellers to join the market, leading to a deeper slide toward $8,500. The overall trend, however, will remain bullish as long as prices stay above $8,000. The case for a pullback to the 200-day MA would weaken if the four-hour chart RSI crosses the descending trendline, in which case the cryptocurrency could have another go at $9,600.   Disclosure: The author does not currently hold any digital assets.

A weekly close ...","Jan 8, 2020 at 11:00 UTC",View,"Bitcoin jumped to seven-week highs early on Wednesday and appears on track to confirm a significant price breakout similar to that seen by gold. According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the number one cryptocurrency by market value rose to $8,463 – the highest level since Nov. 18 – during the Asian trading hours as Iran launched retaliatory attacks on the American bases in Iraq. While bitcoin rallied to multi-week highs, gold, a classic haven asset, jumped above $1,600 for the first time since 2013. Other anti-risk assets like Japanese yen, Swiss franc and U.S. bonds also drew bids. The safe-haven narrative surrounding bitcoin has strengthened with the cryptocurrency gaining ground in tandem with gold since Friday. The yellow metal found takers near $1,530 on Friday after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military commander and rose to a high of $1,611 earlier today. Meanwhile, bitcoin turned higher from lows near $6,850 on Friday and has gained more than 20 percent since. The cryptocurrency now looks set to take a page out of gold’s book and confirm a falling channel breakout on the weekly chart. As can be seen, both assets had a tough time in the second half of 2019. Gold (above right) topped out at $1,557 at the end of August and fell to lows below $1,450 in November, creating a falling channel on the weekly chart. The channel was breached on the higher side in the last week of December with a convincing move above $1,483. The breakout signaled a resumption of the rally from lows near $1,270 seen in April and since then, the yellow metal has rallied by more than 8 percent. Bitcoin’s weekly chart (above left) also shows a falling channel, which represents the sell-off from the June 2019 high of $13,880 to the low of $6,425 reached in December. The cryptocurrency is currently trading above the falling channel resistance of $7,960. A breakout would be confirmed if prices close the week (Sunday, UTC) above $7,960. That would imply a continuation of the rally from April 2019 low of $4,100 and open the doors for a re-test of $13,880.A breakout looks likely with bullish developments on key technical indicators. Bitcoin’s rise to seven-week highs has confirmed seller exhaustion signaled by multiple long-tailed weekly candles and the bullish divergence of the MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and identify trend changes. A bullish divergence occurs when an indicator produces higher lows, contradicting lower lows on price and is considered an advance warning of an impending bullish reversal. The MACD has charted higher lows since early December. Meanwhile, the daily chart is reporting an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout, also a bullish reversal pattern. The recent rally looks to have legs, as buying volumes (not shown) have risen over the last few days and the MACD is charting higher bars above the zero line, signaling a strengthening of bullish momentum. All-in-all, the odds appear stacked in favor of a rise to $8,626 –
the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from $10,350 to
$6,425. The odds of bitcoin confirming a channel breakout this coming
Sunday would drop if prices find acceptance below $8,000 with high
volumes. That said, stronger buying pressure could emerge in the subsequent weeks, yielding a breakout, as miner reward halving (supply-cutting event) is due in May.  At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $8,340, representing a 5.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.

","The top cryptocurrency by market cap started picking up bids at lows below $9,100 late on Tuesday and rose sharply above $9,400 soon before press time, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. Bitcoin was facing selling pressure yesterday and had looked likely to slide to the 200-day average at $8,867. After all, bitcoin had dropped below the former resistance-turned-support of $9,188, validating the bull fatigue, signaling by Monday's doji candle. The decline, however, was cut short near $9,075 as noted above and the 3.5 percent bounce seen since has neutralized the case for a deeper drop. Further, the cryptocurrency has broken out of its two-day long downward trajectory, as seen below. Bitcoin has found acceptance above the upper edge of the channel. The breakout indicates the pullback from Monday's high of $9,615 has ended and the rally from the Jan.24 low of $8,214 has resumed. Supporting the breakout is the relative strength index (RSI), which has violated the descending trendline in favor of the bulls. The MACD histogram, too, has crossed above zero confirming a bullish reversal. Bitcoin has now erased Tuesday's losses, weakening the bearish doji reversal confirmed on Tuesday and validating the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day averages confirmed earlier this week. The cryptocurrency has also moved back above the five- and 10-day moving averages, while the RSI is hovering in the bullish territory above 50.00. A UTC close above Monday's high of $9,615 would likely cause more buyers to join the market, leading to a quick rise to $10,000.On the downside, Tuesday's low of $9,075 is now the level to beat for the sellers.

The bulls have defended the $8,460 level multiple times since late on Sunday. Tuesday's bounce was the third successful defense of the former resistance-turned-support of the last 72 hours (bitcoin had dropped back at the same level on Jan. 8). This morning's spike to $8,793 in the Asian trading hours was short-lived, and the cryptocurrency is currently trading near $8,630. Similar price action has been seen in the last 48 hours. Essentially, bitcoin is generally trapped in the $8,460-$8,750 trading range and only a sustained break above $8,750 would imply bull revival. The range-bound trading is taking place following a convincing downside breach of the ascending trendline over the weekend. An hourly close below $8,461
would confirm range breakdown and signal a continuation of the pullback from
$9,188, opening the door to support at $8,200 (horizontal line) and possibly to
$8,000.On the other hand, an hourly close above $8,750 would confirm an end of the pullback and could fuel a rise to recent highs near $9,200.An upwards move looks the more likely path ahead, as the longer duration charts are reporting bullish conditions. Bitcoin created a bullish outside-day candle on Tuesday, which occurs when prices close the day on a positive note, engulfing preceding day's trading range. The candle is widely considered as an early warning of an impending bullish move. Further, the higher lows on the 4-hour chart's MACD are signaling a weakening of bearish momentum. The weekly chart, too, is indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

Levine: On today’s episode, bitcoin bounces on Iranian aftermath, happy Proof of Keys Day and 2020 plans from big exchange Binance.Adam B. Levine: It’s January 3, 2020, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours. Adam: With geopolitical bombshells dropping in the overnight, Brad’s got the story...Brad Keoun: Bitcoin prices are jumping today after the U.S. government confirmed that President Donald Trump authorized a drone strike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian military commander.Since midnight London time bitcoin is up 5.5 percent, erasing a price slide we saw during the first two days of 2020, and leaving prices just slightly positive during the year so far.It’s tough to state with precision exactly how the strike could affect bitcoin prices in the long term, but in the short term the U.S. military action appears to have pushed up global oil prices, given Iran’s status as one of the world’s biggest oil producers, and the potential for an escalation of the conflict between the two countries.Higher oil prices could potentially contribute to inflation and, according to Ian Shepherdson at the forecasting firm Pantheon Macroeconomics, a sustained oil-price increase could make traders nervous about future economic growth.This plays into one bitcoin price narrative, since many investors view the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation, a so-called “store of value” like gold.Adam: Turning to the news, BlockFi, a cryptocurrency lending firm backed by investors including Galaxy Digital and the Winklevoss twins, says in a blog post that it plans to offer a new BTC rewards card that will pay out rewards in bitcoin when users make purchases, as an alternative to airline miles or cash back.According to the company, the new credit card could provide a ""novel way to introduce crypto to non-owners in an easy, familiar way."" And CoinTelegraph reports that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a court order on Thursday seeking to compel the messaging platform Telegram into releasing details on how it spent some $1.7 billion from an initial offering of its gram tokens.It’s the latest volley in the SEC’s case against Telegram over an allegedly improper unregistered securities sale.Telegram has pushed back against the charges, and legal analysts say the outcome of the case could set an important precedent for future capital-raising in the crypto industry.Brad: Bitmain, the giant Chinese maker of computers used to mine bitcoin, reportedly plans to cut about 50 percent of its staff in the next several months.The news comes via Cointelegraph, which in turn cited Chinese news media.Bitmain, which saw both a slew of management changes in late 2019 as well as some aggressive sales initiatives like limited price guarantees for big wholesale customers and even rental options, describes the latest move as a ""personnel optimization plan.""According to Cointelegraph, the layoffs are expected to be completed prior to bitcoin’s upcoming “halving” expected in May, when the rewards for mining data on the bitcoin blockchain will be reduced by 50 percent, in accordance with the network’s 11-year-old design.And in a twist of gallows humor, Dovey Wan, co-founder of Primitive Ventures and a prominent observer of China’s crypto industry, joked on Twitter that the Bitmain layoffs appeared to be the first halving of 2020. Adam: And for today's featured story, it’s Jan. 3, known in the community as Proof of Keys Day. The movement behind this community holiday celebrates January 3rd each year as the date on which all cryptocurrency users should take custody of any coins kept on an exchange, check your long-term token storage, or anywhere else outside your direct control. The argument here is that blockchain tokens, unlike a bar of gold or a physical stock certificate, can be easily retrieved and verified, even if just temporarily. And if there’s one thing we’ve seen in the markets over the last half dozen years, it’s that keeping your tokens in a custodied exchange isn’t a sure, or even necessarily safe, bet.   While the tradition is currently followed by a relatively small percentage of cryptocurrency holders, its purpose is both unique and pretty smart given the space. Done en masse, this is effectively a regularly scheduled “run on the bank” except the bank is the entire cryptocurrency exchange system. As the saying goes, when the tide goes out you get to see who's swimming naked, or in this case is an exchange who looks insolvent. In traditional finance, bank runs are often seen as apocalyptic as the interdependent financial system can potentially lead to one seemingly insignificant failure dragging down much larger and even more deeply connected counterparties. But in crypto, things don’t have to be that way. So this movement takes the perspective that the only way you can ensure that your exchange can survive a mass wave of withdrawals akin to a bank run is if in real life they can survive an annual exercise where that actually happens. Think of it as the equivalent of the annual stress tests that the Federal Reserve makes the biggest banks undergo.Now, for many traders, the idea of holding tokens anywhere besides an exchange can make them anxious, and it’s not without reason. One of the clarion calls of bitcoin and many early cryptocurrencies has been the opportunity to “Be your own bank,” which is about as powerful as you’d imagine but which comes bundled with a level of responsibility and related fear that you’ve got it wrong, which makes this something of a mixed blessing in practice. For those who have looked at their tokens primarily as an investment which they hold on an exchange like everything else, Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins presents a reminder today, or really on any day of the year, that while blockchains give you the ability to completely control all of your coins and really put your exchange to the test, you can also just take the opportunity to learn the basics, set up a simple wallet on your phone and take possession of a single token.  It can be nerve-wracking to truly be responsible for your investments, we’re just not used to it, and why would we be? Before tokens it really wasn’t possible.  Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins is a low-impact, low-stress way to get a firsthand look at the personal control and related responsibility which, underlying everything, this industry is really about.If you’d like to learn more, visit ProofOfKeys.com, and if you have any questions or thoughts send us an email at podcasts@coindesk.com.Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at 2020 predictions published in recent days by the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Brad: As we move into 2020, there are a lot of predictions flying around on what the new year promises for the crypto industry, from a potential price rally linked to bitcoin’s so-called halving, to the potential flowering of new lending and trading platforms in what is known as decentralized finance, where the functions of financial firms are essentially replicated on platforms that are distributed across many users and computers.Today we’re going to highlight a couple of predictions made in recent days from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its colorful CEO, known to his fans as CZ.He’s a charismatic and sometimes polarizing figure in the crypto world, epitomized by the fact that some of the company’s top executives have gotten Binance tattoos to match his own.CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen in late December described the almost cult-like following as a “bromance.”Well, in a blog post on Thursday addressed to Binancians, CZ wrote that one of Binance’s key goals for 2020 is to ""bring crypto to the masses."" He predicted that by 2030, cryptocurrencies will be used to pay for self-driving rides on Uber, in addition to funding biotech research.   And in a separate post early Friday, Binance said it plans to allow customers to trade bitcoin, ether, ripple and a few other tokens against the euro for the first time.This move by Binance comes as some investors and economists are speculating whether the dollar might lose some of its mojo in the 2020s as the dominant global reserve currency, especially in the face of challenges from rapidly advancing digital-asset technologies.In his blog post, CZ wrote that he sees Binance’s core mission as spreading the freedom of money.And while the company’s most high-profile success has come from its centralized cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.com, he said that the company’s leaders QUOTE strongly believe in decentralization END-QUOTE, embodied in recent efforts to create a decentralized exchangeTying back to the crypto industry’s potential to replace cash, CZ wrote that he believes fiat will co-exist with crypto for a long timeAccording to the post, ""more than 99.9 percent of the money supply is still in fiat, and we need to build bridges, gateways, teleport portals, or whatever you call it, to bring them into crypto.""  Who knows what the future will bring, and Nostradamus he’s not, but given CZ’s cult-like following, a lot of people in the crypto world may pay attention.Adam: Join us again on Monday for the next Markets Daily from CoinDesk.  To make sure you never miss an episode, you can subscribe to Markets daily on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and just about any other place you’d like to listen. If you’re enjoying the show, we really appreciate you leaving a review.

long-term ...","Jan 20, 2020 at 14:00 UTC","Industry veteran Jonathan Wilkins, a co-founder of bitcoin tech start-up Blockstream, is joining up-and-coming bitcoin brokerage River Financial as chief security officer (CSO). ","River is a bitcoin-only financial institution for buying and selling the digital currency (emphatically not an exchange; it says it's ""for the long-term investor""). Currently available only to testers who have received invites, the San Francisco-based outfit is working on an interface it hopes will be as slick as Jack Dorsey's Square Cash, equipped with automatic recurring buys.Wilkins brings C-level gravitas and cypherpunk bona fides to River. He was the CSO at Blockstream, an outfit dedicated to improving bitcoin technology with projects such as Liquid, for faster payments between exchanges and a system of satellites used to broadcast bitcoin block data from space. Early in his career he worked at Zero Knowledge Systems, which built a forerunner to the anonymizing Tor network. (His title there was ""adversary,"" according to his LinkedIn profile.) Later he was a security architect at Microsoft, Zynga and Yelp. Compared to other Blockstream co-founders who are outspoken on Twitter or often appear in the media, Wilkins has laid low. He's joined River to shepherd the company's security model, a particularly important part of the business, since it is custodial, taking care of users' private keys.""By focusing on simplicity and what is best for users in the long term (dollar-cost averaging and holding) instead of pushing altcoins and encouraging more active trading in order to increase fees, River is closer to the historical ideal of a bank,"" said Wilkins. ""I wanted to be part of a company concerned with helping its community grow its wealth and providing an alternative to today's more predatory financial institutions""River Financial has built its infrastructure from ""the ground up,"" founder and CEO Alexander Leishman said. ""We're in this in the long term,"" Leishman said, adding that River has already made a couple of big decisions based on Wilkins' ""guidance,"" such as not relying on third-party cloud computing services. ""It's a lot of work to not do that but we can build a system that we fully control,"" Leishman said.River Financial differs from many services used to buy and sell cryptocurrency in that it's focused solely on bitcoin. ""We believe bitcoin is going to be the most dominant cryptocurrency. If anything becomes a world money, it's going to be bitcoin,""  Leishman said.Even adding one cryptocurrency significantly increases the complexity of engineering a system, he said. Other companies managing many tokens are constantly ""putting out fires.""Plus, working on bitcoin exclusively has allowed River to adopt some cutting-edge technology that other companies don't have the time and energy to look into, Leishman said.  ""Bitcoin-only lets us take it to another level no one has ever taken things before.""River Financial is one of the earliest companies to adopt the lightning network, a speedier payment system that's widely considered a key part of bitcoin's future. In addition, Leishman said River relies ""heavily"" on Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions (PSBT) so that each user in a multi-signature transaction can sign it from a different hardware device.For those interested in the nitty-gritty, River Financial software engineer Philip Glazman tweeted a thread outlining many of the technologies it's using and the decisions it made.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

against one another to find hidden treasure and receive a bitcoin ...","Feb 3, 2020 at 16:00 UTC",A new Minecraft server allows players in the blocky universe to compete against one another to find hidden treasure and receive a bitcoin reward.,"Known as SatoshiQuest, the challenge is to find the hidden loot within ""vast Minecraft landscapes."" Users pay $1 in bitcoin for an in-game life. Entry fees are collected and most will go towards a specific treasure wallet address, which is awarded to the player who finds the loot first. In order to participate, users set up their own in-game wallet they can use to pay for lives and receive their winnings. Should they wish, they can also connect an external wallet to the Minecraft game server. More than 180 million copies of Minecraft have been sold since late 2019, making it the single best-selling video game in history. It allows users to create their own worlds on their own servers. The game has already featured bitcoin, with the BitQuest and PlayMC servers, from 2014 and 2015 respectively, which both integrated the original cryptocurrency to test and educate users about digital currencies. The first round of SatoshiQuest began on Jan. 26 and the game resets once treasure has been found. The server checks the bitcoin spot price every 15 minutes, automatically updating the participation fee to keep it at $1. The project is open source, with the code available on GitHub. Ninety percent of total game fees go towards the treasury address, with the remaining 10 percent going towards developer costs. After finding the treasure, winners receive 85 percent of the balance, while the remaining 5 percent is kept the wallet until the next round. The reward is only paid out if the treasury wallet balance exceeds the transaction fee. The Minecraft contest comes after another more real-world bitcoin treasure hunt was launched last April. Called Satoshi’s Treasure, the game's developers hid the keys to $1 million-worth of bitcoin across the globe.The keys to the bitcoin wallet containing the prize were divided into 1,000 fragments, requiring a minimum of 400 key fragments to access and transfer the funds. Players are able to collect and unravel clues any way they want, and can even sell leads.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

top cryptocurrency by market value crossed the 200-day moving average at $9,000
during Tuesday's Asian trading hours and rose to a high of $9,150, pushing the
cumulative month-to-date gains to over 25 percent. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $9,061. Despite the minor pullback from the morning's high, the cryptocurrency is still reporting a 4.8 percent gain on a 24-hour basis, and is up roughly $700 from lows near $8,250 observed over the weekend, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index. While bitcoin has kicked off the week on a positive note, stock markets across the globe are facing selling pressure. Notably, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by more than 450 points on Monday with travel-related shares suffering sharp losses on fears the coronavirus outbreak in China could spread globally, hurting worldwide economic growth. The virus, which first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan, is spreading fast. It has so far claimed more than 100 lives in China and the number of confirmed cases increased to 4,515 on Tuesday from 2,835 on Monday, according to the National Health Commission.With bitcoin outperforming stocks amid the coronavirus scare, a few experts are convinced the cryptocurrency is drawing haven bids – more so, as classic safe-haven asset gold has risen by just 0.65 percent so far this week. The safe-haven argument, however, is not strong, according to prominent analysts like Alex Kruger. ""Keep in mind that until Friday the narrative was 'Coronavirus pushing bitcoin lower'. It now is 'Coronavirus pushing bitcoin higher.' Some people try very hard to create narratives,"" he tweeted Tuesday.Moreover, bitcoin picked up a strong bid below $7,000 at least two weeks before Chinese authorities placed Wuhan under quarantine on Jan. 23, sending equity markets into a tailspin, and has extended the rally over the last two days. In fact, the virus outbreak could ultimately have a negative impact on crypto markets, Jason Wu, CEO and founder of non-custodial crypto lender DeFiner, told CoinDesk earlier this week. Many Chinese crypto retailers tend to cash in on cryptocurrencies right before the Chinese New Year holiday and reinvest in the market in the next year, Wu said. With the virus outbreak, that money may not return to crypto markets, possibly leading to a price drop.From a technical perspective, bitcoin is looking heavy and could suffer a minor pullback in the next 24 hours. The relative strength index charted a bearish divergence (lower highs) earlier on Tuesday, signaling bullish exhaustion, and dived out of an ascending trendline to indicate an end to the rally from lows near $8,250. The MACD histogram is printing deeper bars below the zero line, indicating a strengthening of downside momentum. The current four-hour candle is flashing red, validating the buyer exhaustion signaled by the preceding inside bar candle, which occurs when the specific period's price action falls within the preceding period's trading range. The RSI has also rolled over from the overbought (above-70) region, signaling scope for correction. Both the hourly and four-hour charts are indicating the cryptocurrency could revisit the former resistance-turned-support at $8,793-$8,750 (horizontal lines on the four-hour chart). A violation there would expose the next support at $8,530. If that level holds, bulls might breathe a sigh of relief and another attempt higher could be initiated targeting resistance at $9,000.The odds of a pullback to $8,750 would weaken if the cryptocurrency finds acceptance above $9,150 during the U.S. trading hours. In that case, the recent high of $9,188 will likely be scaled. It's worth noting that longer duration charts are aligned in favor of the bulls. So, pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived.

the first time in over two months. An inverse head-and-shoulders ...","Jan 7, 2020 at 11:00 UTC",A long-term bitcoin price resistance has come into play for the first time in two months. ,"The widely-tracked 100-day moving average (MA), currently located at $7,945, was breached in the early Asian trading hours, according to Bitstamp data. The move, however, ran out of steam at $8,000 and prices soon fell back below the major hurdle. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,870 on Bitstamp, representing a 14.8 percent gain from Friday's low of $6,853. The global average price, as calculated by CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, currently stands at $7,860 – up 4.6 percent on a 24-hour basis. The 100-day MA last came into play at the end of October. Back then, a UTC close above the average line had remained elusive for three straight days, starting from Oct. 26 to Oct. 28, as seen below. The sharp rise from Oct. 26 lows near $7,400, which many linked to China's President Xi's encouraging comments on blockchain technology, ended with rejection above the 100-day average (marked by a circle). Essentially, bitcoin charted a bearish lower high with the failure at the average hurdle and ended up falling to lows below $6,500 in December. Hence, the 100-day MA at $7,945 is the level to watch out for in the next 24 hours. A UTC close higher will likely invite stronger buying. Technical charts indicate the odds are stacked in favor of a
convincing move above the crucial average resistance. Bitcoin jumped 5.52 percent on Monday, confirming an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart. The bullish reversal pattern has opened the doors for a rise to $8,735 (target as per the measured move method).The breakout is backed by ascending (bullish) 5- and 10-day averages. Further, the 14-day relative strength index is hovering at 63.51, the highest level since Oct. 27, indicating strengthening bullish bias.The short-term bullish case would weaken if prices find acceptance under the former resistance-turned-support of the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline, currently at $7,586, although looks unlikely at press time.The head-and-shoulders breakout on the daily chart has confirmed the seller exhaustion signaled by a hammer candle created in the seven days to Dec. 22 and last week's doji candle. A bullish breakout on the weekly chart would be confirmed only if and when the six-month falling channel is breached to the higher side. Currently, the channel resistance is located at $8,000.

""We accept bitcoin as the most secure blockchain in the world. We ...","Feb 6, 2020 at 16:00 UTC",Blockstack is giving its long-term holders a new way to earn bitcoin.,"Announced Thursday, the decentralized-web startup is rolling out a consensus mechanism that essentially presents a fresh use case for the world's most popular cryptocurrency. When version 2.0 of Blockstack's Stacks blockchain comes out, miners on the network will need to post BTC to mine a block. That BTC will then get shared with nodes maintaining a copy of the ledger.""We accept bitcoin as the most secure blockchain in the world. We accept a world where this will continue to be the case,"" Blockstack CEO Muneeb Ali told CoinDesk in a phone call.The Stacks blockchain, which aims to put user data in the hands of users, is designed so apps can be built without central data storage. Apps can point to where to look for user data, and these pointers are stored on the Stacks blockchain. STX tokens are needed to participate in the chain.To prevent spamming, or Sybil, attacks, all cryptocurrencies require some cost for writing new blocks. Bitcoin did this first by essentially requiring miners to spend electricity to participate, with its Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. By requiring miners to buy bitcoin and turn that over to the network to participate, Blockstack thinks it has found an ample cost to help prevent malicious entries.Called Proof-of-Transfer (or PoX in the new Blockstack white paper describing the mechanism), the new consensus protocol has two kinds of participants: miners and stackers. ""PoX can help to solve a bootstrapping problem for new blockchains,"" the white paper states. “Participation rewards in a separate, potentially more stable, base cryptocurrency can be a better incentive for encouraging initial participation than offering participation rewards in a new cryptocurrency.”Miners write blocks and earn STX tokens in exchange for their BTC – at a rate of 500 STX per block. That BTC will be distributed among the stackers, who will be keeping a copy of the blockchain and also voting on which version of the chain miners should mine on. Blockstack distinguishes this new approach from Proof-of-Stake (PoS) because node participants don't have to put any of their assets at risk to participate, beyond the opportunity cost of agreeing to lock up their STX for some set amount of time.""Proof of Transfer is a proposed design that uses Bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) to launch new blockchains that are anchored in Bitcoin’s security,"" Blockstack wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk in advance. ""Further, PoX can give incentives to earn Bitcoin rewards to participants of such new blockchains. Such Bitcoin rewards were not possible before PoX. These rewards can potentially be used for use cases like consensus participation, ecosystem developer funds, incentives for specific players, etc.""To serve as a stacker won't be cheap, though. It will take roughly $10,000 in STX to participate, Ali said, but like other chains with similar arrangements users won't need to actually have that much. They can delegate to a service that maintains the node, in exchange for agreeing to lock up STX in collaboration with the node operator.Tezos has this with its “bakers” and EOS has effectively turned staking eos to vote for validators into a money-making proposition as well, as we previously reported.What's new with PoX, though, is participants in the network locking up the native token don't earn the native token for doing so. They earn BTC.""I think the market and the entrepreneurs are starting to recognize that bitcoin is the strongest computing network in the world and therefore you can build things on top of it,"" Anthony Pompliano, partner at Morgan Creek Digital, told CoinDesk.But, given the rough outline of the proposal, Pompliano wasn't sure the bitcoin community would get behind it.Mining the Stacks blockchain will be possible with a normal internet connection and computer, Ali said. Miners will just need to watch the price of STX and the price of BTC to assess whether continued participation fits their risk profile.""In our process of mining, the miners can model PoX mining as almost as an exchange,"" Ali said. This should have some sort of arbitrage advantage early on but if all goes well that difference should shrink as participation increases, he added.Miners’ income opportunities will also go up when Blockstack is ready to release its smart contract language, Clarity. Once miners activate it, they will start earning smart-contract fees. Ali argues Stacks may be attractive for developers looking to use smart contracts because they will be able to get extremely precise cost estimates for their code.Blockstack will not participate in mining. The current plan, Ali said, is that once 20 miners activate the new version of the software, Blockstack 2.0 will go live. Miners will continue to have the ultimate decision about upgrades on the network. The current version of Stacks operates atop bitcoin with the vision to eventually migrate out as its own PoW chain. This completely changes with version 2.0.""With this thing, we basically need to never migrate from bitcoin,"" Ali said.Update (Feb. 6, 18:29 UTC): The headline of this piece has been changed for accuracy.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Dorsey calling for it to become part of the universal web standard.","Feb 3, 2020 at 10:49 UTC","Twitter has activated a new bitcoin-branded hashtag, with founder Jack Dorsey calling for it to become part of the universal web standard. ","Dorsey announced Sunday Twitter users could now use the bitcoin symbol as an emoji, appearing automatically after ""#bitcoin"" or ""#btc.""His tweet also tags the Twitter account for Unicode – the computer text and emoji standard for the internet – possibly pushing for the administrating consortium to introduce an emoji that can be used across all web platforms.So far, the branded bitcoin hashtag works only for conventional tags and not for the ""$BTC"" tag that is also popular among Twitter users when talking about cryptocurrency trading.The bitcoin symbol has not been Recommended For General Interchange (RGI), meaning there is no existing emoji that is widely supported across major internet platforms, including the likes of Facebook, LinkedIn as well as Twitter. Dorsey's tweet Sunday suggests he is trying to push Unicode into turning it into an RGI emoji. Unicode has supported the bitcoin symbol as one of its currency signs since 2017. But there is currently no emoji version, meaning the symbol only appears as a black and white glyph, and not in the orange it is frequently portrayed in.  Twitter charges companies up to $1 million for them to add a branded emoji or symbol after a designated hashtag to help differentiate their branding from that of their competitors, helping to create a buzz amongst consumers. Popular branded hashtags in the past have been #PokemonLetsGo, which was purchased in late 2018, as well as #Coca-Cola during a marketing campaign in 2015. These are generally temporary, though, lasting only until the end of the marketing campaign.Dorsey has been a high-profile advocate of cryptocurrency. His payments platform Square has supported bitcoin trading since 2014 and patented a new fiat-crypto payment gateway last month.Last March, he also set up Square Crypto, a small team dedicated to assisting with development of bitcoin.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Based on a ...","Jan 6, 2020 at 12:15 UTC",Bitcoin's hash rate reached record highs this week amid rising prices and anticipation of the miner reward halving later this year.,"Based on a rolling seven-day average, the hash rate has risen sharply from approximately 93 exahashes per second (EH/s) on Dec. 30 to more than 106 EH/s on Jan. 5. The best day overall was Jan. 1 when the hashing power exceeded 119 EH/s, surpassing the previous record of 114 EH/s set back in October. Bitcoin's hash rate has increased considerably over 2019, rising from a weekly average of 40 EH/s at the beginning of the year to 80 EH/s by September. That shift corresponded with the rise in bitcoin's price from roughly $4,000 to more than $10,000 over the same timeframe. The hash rate first crossed the 100 EH/s milestone on Sept. 26, but it wasn't until late October that it stayed above 100 EH/s for more than a day. A plus-100 EH/s rate has become an increasingly frequent sight, with only one day so far this year reporting under the new benchmark. Hash rate is a measure of the processing power dedicated to a blockchain. A high hash rate means more miners are working on the bitcoin network, suggesting it is increasingly economically viable at both the current bitcoin price and difficulty level. A report published in September predicted bitcoin's two-week average hash rate would cross 100 EH/s at the end of 2019.  Bitcoin's difficulty level automatically adjusts to ensure block time stays broadly at around the 10-minute mark, regardless of how many miners are working on the network. It adjusts every two weeks, the last being on Jan. 1 when it increased by 6.75 percent, the largest since September. Plummeting cryptocurrency prices in 2018 forced many miners to shut up shop, with only the largest able to remain profitable. The industry faced an existential crisis as recently as last April when a government agency in China – home to more than two-thirds of all bitcoin mining operations – called mining ""undesirable."" However, the situation looked brighter for miners last year as the bear market faded. More than half a million new application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) rigs are estimated to have come online in Q3 2019, following a summer in which the bitcoin price more than doubled. In recent days, bitcoin prices have taken an upturn, rising nearly 10 percent from lows near $6,850 seen on Friday. The rise may have set the cryptocurrency up for a bullish trend shift, charts suggest, further encouraging miners.2020 is set to be a crucial year for many miners looking to increase their capacity. Bitcoin's block reward is expected to halve to 6.25 BTC in the coming months. While Bitmain is expected to make job cuts in anticipation of a drop in revenue, according to Chinese media, other companies are significantly scaling their operations.  U.K.-listed mining firm Argo Blockchain announced Thursday it had acquired more than 3,600 new bitcoin ASICs, more than quadrupling its total mining capacity. The news caused the company's share price to rise by 6 percent on the London Stock Exchange.

Likewise, a Coinbase spokesperson said Coinbase Commerce processed $135 million worth of cryptocurrency payments for thousands of merchants in 2019, which represents a 600 percent increase in the number of unique transactions via Coinbase Commerce since 2018. Ether and various stablecoins make up a small percentage of both of the above-mentioned totals, with Chainalysis reportedly estimating roughly $4 billion in bitcoin alone was sent through payment processors in 2019. As such, Coinbase is looking to build out its merchant services in 2020.Of course, the number for credit card payments is much higher, dwarfing bitcoin’s $4 billion purchasing power. Credit card purchase volume in 2018 was $3.7 trillion, according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.“In 2020, we’re hyper-focused on providing a complete merchant experience with business features and insights, better serving other geographies with internationalization, adding more currencies, and building seamless integrations that leverage other Coinbase products,” Coinbase Commerce lead Sahil Amoli told CoinDesk.  Among consumer-facing companies, Fold CEO Will Reeves said his shopping app processed more than 2,000 purchases during the 2019 holiday shopping season, out of which 80 percent were Lightning Network transactions. “Amazon, Starbucks, Sephora were the most gifted brands by lightning users,” Reeves said.Another option for merchants also emerged on the scene last week, in the form of Zap’s Strike, an application that lets users make U.S. dollar payments via the lightning network.All things considered, there’s ample reason to be cautiously optimistic about bitcoin usage beyond speculative trading in 2020. However, Lola Luna boutique owner Jean-Michel Daumas, a Coinbase Commerce customer who runs a luxury lingerie business in Paris, warned it’s still too soon to describe bitcoin payments as routine or trendy.“People are not ready to pay with crypto. They prefer to keep it rather than spend it,” Daumas said. “I prefer to receive payments in crypto because they are more secure for me. For example, when I receive payments from PayPal, some people cheat and say they didn’t receive the goods.”Daumas said his boutique received more than 90 bitcoin payments since early 2018, never more than four bitcoin payments a month. His customers are 80 percent men spending bitcoin on lingerie as a status symbol, an insight that aligns with BitPay’s findings that jewelry, precious metals and high-end tech products garner the most bitcoin buyers.“It’s a very high level of fabric, couture-level,” he said. “We sell much more during the Christmas holidays, for example, [which] has much more influence [on the store’s sales trends] than the price of bitcoin.” Indeed, Lola Luna is best known for statement pieces such as open G-string bottoms with dangling feathers to tickle sensitive areas. Perhaps some shoppers may choose to pay with bitcoin so that a “naked bra” and lace collar set doesn’t show up on a credit card bill. But, given French lingerie culture, Daumas said it’s “too early” to conclude why some shoppers prefer using bitcoin. For broader context, BitPay’s Zielke said Europe and the Middle East are generally home to the most high-value merchant transactions, while there are more North American shoppers in terms of unique transactions. In the meantime, Daumas prefers to simply transfer the bitcoin earnings to a hardware wallet and hodl.“I was one of the first global lingerie boutiques on the internet because I’ve always been interested in technology. I remember it was so difficult to build a website,” Daumas said. “It’s the same thing with crypto, that’s where we are now.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The Android version of the game had been live on the Play Store since May 2019, CEO Amy Wan told CoinDesk. Within that time, she said, it amassed 800,000 users, 20,000 ratings and 13,000 written reviews, placing it at the top rank for “bitcoin rewards” searches.“We worked hard to try to get to where we were,” Wan said of Bling's five-person developer team.But shortly after Bling submitted a Bitcoin Blast update that featured new marketing taglines (“Earn Free Bitcoin!” “Cash Out Free Bitcoin!”), which Wan said better reflected the current app experience, Google axed it for “deceptive practices.” A Google Play Store spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment by press time. The Bling team is now unsure how to proceed with future updates; Wan said they still do not know what needs to change. “If we don’t know what [Google] thinks is deceptive about the game, how can we possibly stop being deceptive?” she said. “We know the game inside and out, and Google is spending maybe a minute reviewing it.”Google’s relationship with the cryptocurrency community has been tenuous for months. The search engine giant, owner and operator of YouTube, Chrome and Android OS has blacklisted crypto content with an often shoot-first mentality, only to then go back and rectify apparent mistakes.A reporter played the iOS version of Bitcoin Blast for about 25 minutes on Jan. 28, earning slightly more than 1,000 loyalty points – the minimum amount users can convert into bitcoin. Attempts to convert the points were successful; the reporter’s newly made Coinbase account received 103 sats on Jan 29.But Bling, and the app, may now have to reset. Wan said Google would not let her team fix Bitcoin Blast without submitting an entirely new version under a fresh bundle ID – deleting the game’s amassed history and user reviews. Google has already rejected the company’s first appeal, Wan said.Google further informed Bling, “Additional suspensions of any nature may result in the termination of your developer account, and investigation and possible termination of related Google accounts,” according to screenshots reviewed by CoinDesk.If that were to happen, Wan said, it would effectively throttle Bling's entire tech infrastructure, including its iOS app hosted on Google Cloud. “For us, that was a very serious threat because our business runs on Google,” she said. After taking news of the suspension to Twitter, Wan said the Google Play developer Twitter account informed her it would grant the appeal and “escalate” her case. But she has not seen any meaningful changes in the Play developer console and is unsure what, if anything, will change.“I think it is a black box for all app developers, but I think in particular crypto apps are probably more sensitive,” she said.Wan said the unexplained suspension carries hallmarks of other recent Google actions against crypto programs, services and content. Late last year, YouTube deleted hundreds of crypto-related videos before reinstating most. Chrome also suspended the MetaMask wallet on suspicion it enabled crypto mining. That, too, has been reinstated.Wan noted the Apple version of the game is still live.“I feel like [Google] is worse for crypto companies because the moment they see crypto or bitcoin, I think Google's red flags just go off,” she said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The private bank Falcon Group, for example, launched bitcoin management services in 2017. Matthew Blake, the World Economic Forum's monetary systems lead, described crypto-friendly, fully licensed banks as an emerging trend.""It's something institutions can do to hedge,"" he said.Likewise, the Swiss crypto startup Bitcoin Suisse has also applied for a universal banking license with the goal of offering everything from staking services to loans. “We're not applying for a banking license just to be like every other bank. We are pioneers at heart,” Niklas Nikolajsen, founder and chairman of Bitcoin Suisse, said via spokesperson. “We will, of course, offer cash accounts for our clients, in their own name. ... We will be able to start trading crypto securities, stablecoins and synthetics, such as mini-futures and products to short the major crypto assets.” However, among such banks so far, SEBA offers a unique ability to hold a variety of many fiat currencies, including American dollars, Hong Kong dollars and Singaporean dollars, then instantly trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether and Stellar lumens. “You can open an account over the phone in 15 minutes for an accredited investor, you don’t have to go to Switzerland,” Bühler said. “There’s always going to be aspects that banks are required for, and the first one is the storage of your private key.” For Schwarzenbach, who described himself as a libertarian who runs his own Lightning Network node he made using a Raspberry Pi, bitcoin banking makes sense for the physical security benefits. He wouldn’t want the risk of someone hurting him to get at his bitcoin stash.Bühler said the young bank already serves high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors from all over the world, excluding the United States, plus a few blockchain startups. Schwarzenbach added that open source decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms inspired by MakerDAO could eventually offer comparable financial infrastructure to both the general population and the proverbial 1 percent. “My hope is that we will be able to develop and adopt that [DeFi] infrastructure,” Schwarzenbach said. “And it is my expectation that standards will present themselves with market maturation.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

If bitcoin’s price climbs, traders lose. If it falls, they win.“If you’ve ever tried trading options or futures, you’ll see that it’s pretty difficult,” Amun CEO Hany Rashwan said in a phone interview. “It's not the easiest thing which is why it's just easier to say ‘I think bitcoin price will go down, I'm going to buy this stock.’”Compared to entering short trade positions on bitcoin – wherein an investor expects the price to fall and bets against an asset’s value rising by buying and selling a position on loaned funds  – Amun’s Short Bitcoin ETP does not require loaned capital. Rather, the product captures bitcoin’s price movement inversely in one stock purchase akin to a synthetic exchange-traded note (ETN) comprised of short positions. Furthermore, all positions reset at the end of the trading day with performances not rolling over to the next day.Rashwan noted the rise of crypto derivatives, particularly from lightly or completely unregulated exchanges, which are taking up to 99 percent of the bitcoin derivative market’s volume compared to legacy providers such as CME Group or ICE’s Bakkt. Indeed, crypto derivatives platform FTX traded some 2,405 options contracts traded on its inaugural day, Jan. 13, versus 54 options contracts on CME which opened the same day, according to financial publication Micky. Options on CME are constructed at 5 bitcoin per contract while FTX allows users to draft their own.Responding to consumer demand, Rashwan said Amun has positioned itself to provide new forms of crypto exposure in just a few clicks. “We hope to bring the easiest and most regulated user experience to short or leverage crypto exposure and this is the first step towards that vision... You don’t have to figure out how to open and shut the contract. You don't need to deal with what a perpetual swap is. Nothing of that sort. You just buy a stock,” Rashwan added.Amun, with some $50 million in assets under management, offers 10 crypto-based ETP products on the Swiss SIX and Boerse Stuttgart. The firm recently garnered approval from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (SFSA) to extend its offering into other European retail markets. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

An options contract gives the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the specified amount of the underlying on or before the expiration date. A call option gives the holder a right to buy, while the put option gives the holder the right to sell.New York-based Bakkt launched the first regulated bitcoin options contract on Dec. 9, having rolled out a cash-settled futures and physically settled futures November and September, respectively.The physically delivered product, which went live on Sept. 24, was well received by the markets. Trading volumes quadrupled to $4.8 million in one month after launch, as noted by Bakkt Volume Bot, a Twitter account that tracks the exchange’s trades. The solid growth likely motivated Bakkt to offer option contracts on bitcoin.So far, however, the uptake for its options product has been weak. Bakkt traded a little over $1 million worth of options in the first four weeks since the launch on Dec. 9. The highest contract, worth $500,000, was initiated during the second week.These numbers appear weak when compared to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's (CME) first-day options trading volume of $2.3 million. Trading activity on Bakkt has dwindled particularly since the launch of options on the CME. The CME listed options on Jan. 13, a month after Bakkt's launch. Even so, the Chicago-based exchange is witnessing higher trading volumes; while Bakkt saw no activity last week, the CME traded 59 lots of options.For now, institutional investors seem to be preferring CME over Bakkt, which isn't surprising as the CME's two-year-old bitcoin futures are among the most liquid derivative products in the cryptocurrency space. While Bakkt futures witnessed a record trading volume of 6,600 contracts on Dec. 18, the CME futures registered an average daily volume of 6,400 in 2019. However, the difference is substantially more pronounced given that Bakkt’s contracts are for one bitcoin each while the CME futures’ contract size is five bitcoin. It remains to be seen if Bakkt volume will pick up with a potential rise in price volatility ahead of the mining reward halving due in May or if the CME will continue to dominate the derivatives space.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

For ""bitcoin halving,"" that happened in 2016, when the last such event occurred. Bitcoin prices doubled that year and surged by 13 times in 2017.  The halving was codified into bitcoin’s underlying software code when the cryptocurrency was launched just over a decade ago. Every four years, the bitcoin network undergoes a 50 percent reduction in its ""mining rewards"" - essentially the number of new units of the cryptocurrency issued as rewards to computer operators that are working to confirm data on the underlying blockchain network.Some crypto investors say the event could boost bitcoin’s price because the pace of new issuance will decrease at a time when more investors are considering getting into, or increasing their allocations of, the cryptocurrency. As an investment, bitcoin has outperformed traditional assets like equities, with a price jump of 94 percent in 2019 that was roughly triple last year’s gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks.Analysts for the German bank BayernLB predicted last year the halving could send bitcoin to a new record around $90,000, but some investors maintain that the event is so well telegraphed and understood that it’s likely already reflected in the market price, currently around $8,500.Within the crypto industry, the halving is highly anticipated. Some enthusiasts have even created a dedicated website to count down the remaining days, hours, minutes and seconds until it happens. According to the site, bitcoinblockhalf.com, the event will take place on or around May 12 - now just 108 days away. But while it appears more are interested in what the term signifies, Arcane Research noted “bitcoin halving” still garners far fewer searches than just “bitcoin.” According to Google Trends, “bitcoin” by itself garnered at least 30 times more searches than “bitcoin halving.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

While some of the bitcoin was converted into fiat currency, the remainder appears to have been sent to an address on the Bitfinex platform. The court ordered Bitfinex to freeze the address and share its know-your-customer (KYC) information about the account's owner.The victim, an unnamed firm, had been told to pay $1.2 million in bitcoin after its computers were hijacked by ransomware. The company's insurer, which filed the court claim, ultimately paid $950,000 in the form of 109.25 BTC, according to the filing. While some of these funds were converted into fiat and are not traceable, 96 BTC (worth $861,200 at press time) were sent to an address owned by Bitfinex. New Money Review claims this ruling marks the first instance of the U.K. High Court endorsing bitcoin as property.In a statement, Chainalysis Director of Communications Maddie Kennedy said that ""a leading cyber insurer used Chainalysis software to investigate ransomware payments made on behalf of their clients and trace the flow of funds from the point of extortion to known services such as exchanges.""""A significant amount"" of this ransom was tracked to a user on Bitfinex, and the insurance firm's lawyers were able to successfully petition for a freeze on these funds, she said. The filing confirms Chainalysis assisted in tracking the bitcoin. Bitfinex and its parent firm, iFinex, are listed as defendants (""D4"" and ""D3,"" respectively) in the filing. However, the exchange said in a statement it has been working with the claimant to trace the bitcoin and it is not now seen as being involved with the crime.""Bitfinex has robust systems in place to allow it to assist law enforcement authorities and litigants in cases such as this,"" the statement said.

Peter Wall, Argo CEO, said: ""Our mining operations continued to generate industry-best mining margin in the last quarter despite a softening in market conditions from the previous quarter. Our state-of-the-art mining platform is performing as expected and with the expansion of our mining network on pace, along with the recent rise with the price of Bitcoin, Argo is well-placed for a strong year ahead.""The firm has been ramping up its mining capacity ahead of the reward halving event due in May, and currently has 13,364 devices. That includes 6,375 Bitmain Antminer T17s installed since Jan. 1. Argo said it is ""on track"" to have another 3,625 T17s up and running by the end of this quarter.By the firm's estimates, the full expected capacity of 17,000 miners will see the power it contributes to the bitcoin network rise from 380 petahashes to over 650 petahashes.At the time of writing, Argo's stock price has risen following the announcement, up 3.55 percent at £7.30.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

2015: Report",https://www.coindesk.com/palestinian-militant-group-has-received-3370-bitcoins-in-donations-since-2015-report,"The Bitcoin Abuse Database linked the wallet to Hamas in February 2019, 
saying it had been used for ""collecting donations to a terrorist ...","Jan 20, 2020 at 13:00 UTC","A Palestinian militant group took millions of dollars' worth of bitcoin donations to finance its operations, according to a new report.","Obtained by the Jerusalem Post and reported Sunday, the report from the Israeli International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT) found the al-Nasser Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), used bitcoin sent from overseas as a means of funding operations in and out of the Gaza Strip. ICT researchers linked the group to the bitcoin wallet address, ""1LaNXgq2ctDEa4fTha6PTo8sucqzieQctq,"" which showed ""an irregular increase in the scope of activity"" with more than 4,500 transactions over the past four years. The report claims the group – which the Jerusalem Post says has links to Hamas – used bitcoin to avoid sanctions, offer a degree of anonymity to donors from overseas and enable cross-border money transfers. The wallet, which had received a total of nearly 3,370 BTC (almost $29 million at current prices) between October 2015 and July 2019, was also linked to financial website ""cash4ps.""  Digging a little deeper, researchers found cash4ps had a bank account with the Islamic National Bank, designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization in 2010 for its connection to Hamas. The Bitcoin Abuse Database linked the wallet to Hamas in February 2019, saying it had been used for ""collecting donations to a terrorist organization.""The PRC is a coalition of various armed groups, affiliated with Hamas, that has fought for the total reclamation of a state of Palestine from Israel since 2000. Through the al-Nasser Brigades, it is generally considered to be one of the strongest factions in Gaza, with close links to Hamas and Hezbollah. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by both Israel and the U.S. The al-Nasser Brigades has been active in numerous conflicts with Israel. It was part of a broader group, including Hamas, responsible for the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Shalit was released in 2011 following a prisoner exchange deal. This isn't the first time Palestinian militant groups have been found to be using cryptocurrencies. One Israeli blockchain analytics firm reported in February 2019 that Hamas may be using a Coinbase wallet address to help with fundraising. The New York Times previously said bitcoin had been used for “tens of thousands of dollars” worth of illicit transactions. Iran has historically been one of the primary backers for many armed groups in Palestine. The country reportedly donated as much as $23 million every month to Hamas following the group's 2006 victory in the Palestinian legislative elections. But much of this funding was cut in 2013 after Hamas continued supporting the revolution against the Iranian-backed Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.  The ICT researchers connected the bitcoin wallet to various Facebook posts from the al-Nasser-affiliated al-Baraq media, which appealed for support ""due to lack of resources and Iran’s rejection to their request for support.""As opposition efforts in Syria have faded, Iranian relations with Palestinian armed groups have begun to warm over the past year. Just over a month after the last transaction on the identified bitcoin wallet, Iran increased its monthly payments to Hamas to $30 million in return for assistance gathering intelligence on the missile stockpiles of their ""common enemy"" Israel. It's unclear if Palestinian militants are continuing to focus on bitcoin as a fundraising mechanism now that many have re-developed stronger ties with Iran.Economic isolation has also forced many Palestinian businesses to use cryptocurrency to send and receive international payments. CoinDesk previously highlighted that there were up to 20 bitcoin dealers operating in Gaza, each processing as much as $5 million to $6 million per month for clients including charities based overseas as well as domestic businesses or entrepreneurs. One source at the time said that Hamas' use of bitcoin may very well have helped raise awareness of bitcoin among Palestinians.

CoinDesk. Like futures, the launch of bitcoin options on major exchanges ...","Jan 31, 2020 at 21:17 UTC",Richard Rosenblum is co-founder and co-head of trading at crypto liquidity provider GSR. The opinions below are the author's and do not reflect the position of CoinDesk.,"Like futures, the launch of bitcoin options on major exchanges has been met with anticipation.Hopeful observers believe the CME's and Bakkt’s entry into the burgeoning options market will further encourage institutional participation. It will – but not necessarily in the way they expect.For major institutions, miners and other corporates involved in the space, options open a new, powerful tool for managing risk and volatility. But, as we can see from other financial markets, these capabilities won’t come from the listed options themselves. Instead, the real action will take place in over-the-counter hedges. While these corporate-focused products will rely on vanilla option liquidity, they will not take place on exchanges.Before we explain why this is the case, it’s worth highlighting the growing demand for options as a means to hedging. Options have been the fastest-growing product segment of the crypto market in 2019, with the trajectory of volumes likely to accelerate in 2020. Crypto derivatives volumes are nascent compared to the spot market and the size by which some financial derivatives dwarf their respective spot markets. Nonetheless, the emergence of a variety of derivatives should have a significant influence on the growth of the space. Now, to understand how the options market will serve as the foundation for corporate risk management, I can draw upon my experience managing hedging programs at Goldman Sachs for some of the world’s biggest corporations. There, the focus was on helping entities with natural exposures hedge their risks. On the supply side, the biggest yearly trade in commodities was when Mexico would buy puts to hedge their royalties on the country’s oil production. On the demand side, airlines and shipping companies would come to market to lock in forward prices to hedge their consumption. However, these entities rarely traded ""listed"" exchange products directly. Characteristics of listed options products are not a good fit for corporate risk, they are more meant for specialists and speculation. Corporate entities prefer to trade products that are specifically built for them, that utilize the liquidity of the exchange-listed products. In the crypto world, the single-day expiration date of these products means traders need to deal with the volatility of the expiry day, which could be prone to emotional sentiment or other non-economic factors. A single-day hedge is likely too short in duration for a corporation like a miner to properly protect the value of their outputs or market exposure. Instead, custom-built swaps and options strategies provide a better solution for many in the ecosystem as a hedge, as they would allow the parties to hedge ratably each day as they balance out exposure over longer periods.  Further parallels can be drawn between oil producers and bitcoin miners. Mining costs vary as new equipment comes to market and electricity prices fluctuate. Bitcoin volatility also eats at profitability. With major miners having gone public and/or reporting to a group of shareholders, the pressure to maintain a good balance sheet is growing. Additionally, margin compression resulting from the upcoming halving is likely to push miners to better manage the risk of volatility. More risk will lie in the hands of fewer miners as the market consolidates. Like oil producers, these companies will increasingly look towards hedging solutions to ensure the costs of mining will not outpace market pricing of the resulting digital assets. Lenders will also begin to mandate that miners hedge so they will still be able to meet their obligations as borrowers in the event of a bear market. Corporates - whether they be oil companies or bitcoin miners - usually do not trade directly on exchanges. They require a different product offering and manner of doing business. In addition to the temporal mismatch resulting from hedging daily risk with a single-day ""bullet"" expiry, futures exchanges are difficult to connect to, as entities must trade through an FCM (Futures Clearing Merchant). This creates space for hedging products tailor-made for crypto-native firms. However, these products still need to hedge the core volatility risk somewhere, so it is first necessary for liquidity to build on listed products. The emergence of liquidity in the listed options market will be the foundation for these types of hedges.Once companies can hedge these listed products, the risk that is left is more of a residual nature. Market makers are primed to take on these risks and be the trading counterparty for these hedges.  The existence of listed vanilla options on mainstream exchanges is only the beginning. For corporates, miners and others, the excitement lies in what can be done once saturation of underlying liquidity in volatility arrives. This is the base on which a whole host of other volatility-related products can be built, particularly as it relates to corporate hedging and risk management. Ultimately, this helps reduce unwanted exposures and enables more investment. In this way, listed options serve as the starting point for a whole new array of products and services.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

their bitcoin trades,” Silvergate CEO Alan J. Lane said. In this 
scenario, ...","Jan 30, 2020 at 22:00 UTC",Silvergate Bank is venturing even further into a field where few financial institutions dare to tiptoe.,"The La Jolla, Calif., lender made a name for itself providing hard-to-come-by U.S.-dollar banking services for businesses that deal in cryptocurrency. But now Silvergate wants to handle digital assets themselves.While the bank has no such services on its roadmap yet, it has applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto. One example of this might look like “providing settlement services for their bitcoin trades,” Silvergate CEO Alan J. Lane said. In this scenario, Silvergate would be the intermediary ensuring settlement of a fiat-for-bitcoin exchange between two participants on its Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a payments platform that allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between crypto exchanges. ""In order for us to be able to be that trusted intermediary, we have to be able to touch the digital assets ourselves,” Lane said. ""Think about it as if Silvergate also had the ability to be the SEN for bitcoin.""The service, almost certainly the first of its kind offered by a U.S. commercial bank, wouldn’t apply to retail investors or institutional investors that are already comfortable with bitcoin as an asset class.“It’s folks that aren’t quite ready to be in the business, and part of the reason is because this doesn’t exist,” Lane said, emphasizing the bank doesn’t yet have a product in mind to solve the problem. “Our current customers, they’ve already figured out a way to get comfortable with this, but they tell us there are other counterparties out there that they’re not yet doing business with because they don’t have a trusted way to settle.” Lane spoke to CoinDesk Wednesday after Silvergate’s first conference call as a publicly traded company. Earlier in the day it had reported fourth-quarter results, including a 6 percent increase in crypto clients and a 4 percent decrease in deposits from those clients. Silvergate Bank’s 2020 will be characterized by staff getting the bank’s bitcoin-collateralized margin lending running well and solving other pain points in the digital asset industry, Lane said.Salary expenses climbed nearly 6 percent from a year earlier to $8.7 million in the fourth quarter. The majority of this went toward customer service and software engineers, Lane said when asked what share of the expenses was from compliance costs. The bank does spend money on compliance, of course: Silvergate uses both Chainalysis and Elliptic, Lane said. These vendors analyze the public blockchains to flag suspicious activity, which banks are required under Federal Reserve regulations to report.With $2.1 billion in assets, Silvergate is a relatively small institution, 0.07 percent the size of JPMorgan. The asset side of its balance sheet looks like a traditional community lender, composed mainly of real estate loans. But that may start to evolve soon.In the immediate future, Silvergate's biggest focus is its pilot of the SEN Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin.Since the 90-to-180-day pilot will include only SEN participants, the bank will be able to monitor SEN Leverage loans more closely than it could other types of loans. “We will be able to monitor the loan, the collateral underlying the loan and the balance of the loan, 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Lane said. “We’ll be able to monitor this much more closely than we can monitor just about any other loan we make.”In response to questions from analysts in the company’s earnings call about yield on SEN loans, Lane said, “The way we’ve thought about this initially is this would likely be a high single-digit type of cost to the borrower.” In the interview, Lane emphasized the bank wouldn’t take advantage of crypto customers on SEN loans just because other banks aren’t offering the same product. “We’re certainly not going to poke their eyes out on what we’re charging them,” Lane said. Silvergate is also working to increase the number of fiat currencies it supports for foreign exchange transactions on the SEN to include at least the top five to 10 major global currencies. From fourth-quarter 2018 to fourth-quarter 2019, volume on the SEN increased by 150 percent to an all-time high of 14,400 transactions handling $9.6 billion.  “Our customers are saying, ‘We’d love to have the SEN for the euro and the SEN for the yen,’” Lane said. “That involves having correspondent banking relationships with banks in those areas where those currencies are predominant and then being able to create a similar type of network as to what we’ve created with the SEN.” Taking Silvergate public has given the crypto industry a clearer window into the bank's business. It also positions Silvergate to more easily raise capital should the need arise.Currently, Silvergate has a 10.5 percent leverage ratio, meaning the bank has more than twice the amount of capital required by banking regulators (5 percent). ""On that metric alone, we could double the size of the bank and not run out of capital,"" Lane said. ""That's just one metric, and I'm not suggesting we would do that … but if we saw that leverage ratio going down to 8 percent, we would look to raise additional capital.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Jimmy Nguyen, president of the Bitcoin Association and bitcoin SV advocate, tweeted, adding the ""historic moment"" had been confirmed at block 620539. By rolling out the original bitcoin protocol first released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, the Genesis fork removes the default hard cap for block sizes, reportedly removing limits for transaction capacity and  increasing on-chain scalability. Doing away with the hard cap allows businesses to build ""large-scale applications"" on BSV, the project said Tuesday. A change in the bitcoin scripting language, they add, will enable the protocol to perform functions – like smart contracts – and potentially allow the project to compete with blockchain projects such as ethereum.Genesis is designed to be the last significant update on the BSV blockchain; the implementation has been ""locked-in irrevocably,"" according to an on-chain message in the first post-fork transaction from the BSV developer team. An unchanging base protocol saves developers and companies from having to undergo frequent technical changes, the team says.BitMEX Research tweeted there were still ""a significant number of nodes [that] have not upgraded for the hardfork and are stuck on the pre-hardfork block,"" an hour or so after the Genesis implementation.Initially there appeared to be no signs of a chain split – where a blockchain splinters into multiple active versions – but BitMEX research reported just a few hours later the pre-Genesis chain had been ""extended by one block.""A BSV spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk the split had been caused by one miner – ""which in the scheme of things is very good"" – the Bitcoin Association was trying to contact. Nguyen said this was not a ""persistent chain split"" but what appeared to be a miner ""who did not update their software to Genesis."" None of the mining pools so far contacted by the association had been responsible for the ""inadvertent block,"" he added. ""A single block inadvertently mined on the wrong chain will not be extended - just the way Nakamoto consensus is supposed to work as described in the Bitcoin white paper. Nodes consider the longest chain as valid and extend that branch,"" Nguyen said.BSV has been at the center of controversy since it forked from bitcoin cash in November 2018. One of its main proponents, Craig Wright, has claimed to be bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto since 2016; many industry figures have disagreed with his claims, however. Further, the cryptocurrency's proponents commonly hold the belief that BSV is the true bitcoin. ""Bitcoin can finally be Bitcoin again and the miners can continue to write the Chronicle of everything,"" stated the on-chain post-fork message.Emotions still run high on this issue. For instance, after announcing Monday that Twitter added a bitcoin emoji to its platform, billionaire and BSV advocate Calvin Ayre tweeted founder Jack Dorsey he is backing the ""wrong side.""""BTC is not Bitcoin and with the lawsuits that I know are coming related to this issue, this year.  Your putting your finger on the scale on the wrong side of facts is not going to end well for Twitter,"" Ayre wrote.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, IIG's Amir Hossein Saeedi Naeini said that although there are now licensed cryptocurrency mining operations in the country, the new regulations have not attracted much foreign investment, according to a Financial Tribune report citing Ibena.""Our studies show that the crypto mining industry has the potential to add $8.5 billion to the economy,"" he said to local media. ""[But] most potential investors have left for neighboring countries, because they offer incentives for crypto miners.""The Iranian mining industry has grown significantly in recent years, with many operators attracted to the country because of state-subsidized electricity tariffs. Some of the most popular online Iranian crypto mining channels have thousands of members. In 2019, the Iranian government proposed legislation that would officially recognize cryptocurrency mining as a legitimate business activity. Under a draft proposal, operators have to submit detailed information about their mining activities in return for a license that would need to be renewed on a yearly basis. The licensing regime, which received formal approval from the Minister of Industry, Mine and Trade last summer, only applies to mining farms with equipment that consumes more than 30 kilowatts of energy, shutting out smaller household operations. Prior to the licensing system, some mining operators told CoinDesk they operated within a climate of fear as the penalties for non-compliance were high. Those caught were likely to face fines, the confiscation of their equipment and even jail time. Some said they felt forced to consider moving to neighboring countries. Last June, officials confiscated more than 1,000 mining rigs from two operators after the government blamed a sudden 7 percent surge in electricity consumption on the mining industry.

Shafik Gabr, chairman of the ARTOC Group for Investment & Development, some Middle Eastern nations are already exploring the possibility of settling oil contracts in bitcoin. But he declined to specify which, and most of the leaders gathered in Davos for the annual conference that wrapped up Friday are adamant they see bitcoin’s post-sovereign nature as anathema. Fellow Egyptian investor Ahmed Heikal, CEO of Qalaa Holdings, said he’s not bullish on bitcoin because it “doesn’t have the legal framework” for such wholesale deals. If nations or energy enterprises are to use bitcoin, he argued, it won’t be for at least another decade. Delegates from Oman to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia all expressed similarly dismissive views about bitcoin as an asset, often referring to it as a gambling conduit. But when asked if it could still be used to settle oil contracts – especially considering the United States’ aggressive economic pressure on energy exporters Iran and Iraq – one Omani politician, who did not want to be identified, teased, “It depends on who's asking.” U.S. sanctions are top-of-mind across the region, as when President Donald Trump urged Europe not to trade with “unfriendly” energy suppliers. Iraqi President Barham Salih pushed back with a speech on Wednesday that asserted it was Iraq’s sovereign right to have relations with neighbors on its own terms. Saudi Arabian businessman Hamza Alkholi, CEO of Al-Kholi Group, dismissed the idea that bitcoin-denominated oil contracts could ever be more than an outlier. “We’ve been trying for 30 years,” he said, referencing efforts to move beyond the U.S. dollar by settling oil contracts in euros. “Until bitcoin is regulated like the stock market, I don’t see that happening.” Crescent Enterprises CEO Badr Jafar, who is heavily invested in the oil and gas industry, agreed there’s no urgency among most players in his industry to move away from the dollar. Leaders and businessmen still don’t “trust” cryptocurrency, Jafar said, and he expects central banks would push back if bitcoin gained more significant usage.However, if oil contracts were to be settled in currencies beyond the dollar, Jafar said that might be driven by political factors related to Russia and China.And soon there will be a digital currency issuer eager to help dollar-weary energy suppliers find alternative settlement systems. Equally concerned about “trust,” China is hyper-focused on both compliance and global market opportunities. Chinese businesspeople see Eurasian crypto ventures as a stepping stone toward addressing more complex commodities markets.China Blockchain Delegation Chairman Danny Deng said China’s blockchain-based currency, which he expects the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to launch on a limited scale in 2020, could offer a backbone for energy markets. “Bitcoin has a larger and larger ecosystem, but it still can’t afford the trading volume of such a commodity,” Deng said. “The traders of oil and gas are using leverage. That leverage must be backed by financial systems. Regions, like Iran … may use bitcoin or other payment systems. But other countries that don’t have this problem may play an important role in national [cryptocurrency] settlements.”From his perspective, fiat currency has become too political, rather than a strictly commercial tool. One of China’s most revered bitcoiners, Wang Wei, a leader of nearly a dozen associations from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Advisory Committee to the China Mergers and Acquisitions Association, said bitcoin lost its chance to be the dominant currency for settlements and will instead primarily be a store of value.Several Chinese businessmen who work with the government and PBoC agreed the bank could offer an alternative to dollar settlement systems by 2021. For example, Zhang Shousong, secretary general of the China Blockchain Application Center, said by the next Davos conference PBoC’s digital currency will be operational “not only in China, but all over the globe.” Given the tenor of public officials’ statements, Deng said cryptocurrency rails are “on a fast track.” Shousong added it’s “not like Libra, it’s certainly going to launch,” referring to the Facebook-initiated global currency project whose debut remains uncertain. In the meantime, Wei has taken Chinese-speaking Kazakhstani entrepreneur Tilektes Adambekov under his wing and helped the latter establish the licensed EBX crypto exchange in Kazakhstan, the world’s 10th-largest oil exporter. Adambekov joined the Chinese delegation for lunch in Davos to discuss the future of global markets over foie gras and fig chutney in a mountaintop restaurant with a panoramic view. Adambekov quoted Mao Zedong in a thank you speech to the delegation, which prompted resounding applause. From the delegation’s perspective, Adambekov is a perfect fit for China’s aspirations. He spent eight years working in China before returning home to focus on serving Russian-speaking crypto markets across borders. Plus, Kazakhstan has an open regulatory framework and is strategically situated along the path of China’s “Belt and Road” initiative. Adambekov said his exchange aims to support tokenized oil and gas options, settled in national cryptocurrencies yet offering bitcoin liquidity. From China to Oman, all businesspeople and diplomats agreed the dollar will remain king in commodities markets for the near future. But alternative options may already be on the horizon. When asked if such options could usurp the greenback by 2025, Matthew Blake, the World Economic Forum's monetary systems lead, said the dollar’s role is so pronounced that “to displace it in a meaningful way would take longer than four years.”  Bitcoin may, or may not, participate in that shift. “Bitcoin has demonstrated some of the qualities that a distributed currency can possess,” Blake said. “It’s also had challenges too. The role of a currency is to have a store-of-value with an inherent level of stability. There needs to be liquidity. In the case of bitcoin, it hasn’t had those qualities thus far.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""It's not a means of payment. It just isn't.""","Disparte spoke at the Digital Money Forum at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, making his argument to gadget fans and technology's early adopters.""The bottom rung of the ladder of economic mobility is payment access,"" Disparte said. And so far, he said, crypto just isn't cutting it on payments. Disparte said that's why he became interested in what Facebook was building with Libra. The Libra Association is a consortium of large companies that aims to eventually launch the Libra stablecoin, a federated cryptocurrency designed by Facebook for the millions of people who don't have access to banking services. Each company involved would run a node, but only those approved by existing members can join. Though it is more decentralized than existing finance, it is not permissionless, like bitcoin or ethereum. Libra is trying to solve a complex problem. ""How do you drive mass adoption?"" Disparte said. ""How do you remove insidious levels of friction that basically make it cost-prohibitive to give people access to payments?""""I'm not convinced that a council of self-interested companies can do money better than a decentralized system,"" Akin Sawyerr, a strategy lead on the Decred project, said on the Tuesday panel. ""The only way to really get there is to empower the individuals to have some base-level sovereignty.""By sovereignty, Sawyerr meant a level on which a person has uncensorable control of their money. In bitcoin terms, as long as a person controls their keys, no one can take away their bitcoin.

Late last month, Rosatom State Atomic ...","Jan 8, 2020 at 17:15 UTC","UDOMLYA, Russia – A state-owned nuclear power plant in Russia may soon fuel a bitcoin mining hub.","Late last month, Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation opened a venue for a mining farm near the Kalinin nuclear plant in Udomlya, 200 miles northwest of Moscow. The company spent more than $4.8 million building the 30-megawatt facility, according to Sergei Nemchenkov, the head of data centers and digital products at Rosenergoatom, a Rosatom subsidiary.Rosenergoatom isn’t planning to mine itself, Nemchenkov said. Rather, it will capitalize on the opportunity to sell additional electricity to heavy users and rent space for their equipment, similar to a data center the firm built near the plant. ""Both data centers and miners are large energy consumers with a stable demand,"" Nemchenkov said. ""For us, it's a way to diversify.""Rosatom is the first big government-related entity to embrace miners in Russia, the world's eleventh-largest economy, according to the IMF and the World Bank. And with plans to eventually open 240 megawatts or more of its power from several locations to the industry, the company could become a notable player on the global market.To put that number in perspective, Chinese mining giant Bitmain's facility under construction in Rockdale, Texas, is expected to start with a capacity of 25 to 50 megawatts and eventually expand to 300 megawatts. Another facility being built in the same town would start at 300 MW and eventually go up to 1 gigawatt; both are claiming the title of world's largest.The Kalinin plant (built in 1974 and named after a statesman who was the formal head of the Soviet state from 1919 until 1946) is another example of miners in Russia nesting close to old industrial sites, like the abandoned factories in Siberia that are attracting miners from all over the world.In Udomlya, a rectangular field of about 215,000 square feet is expected to fit up to 30 containers, each with room for almost 400 individual mining computers. Electricity for miners will cost 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt-hour – not the cheapest price you can find around the globe, as rates lower than 4 cents can be found in some regions of China and Kazakhstan. But Rosenergoatom wants to market the project, first of all, as a legitimate, reputable way to mine cryptocurrency, right on the energy producer’s property.“It’s a totally white deal,” Nemchenkov said. To find clients, Rosenergoatom partnered with ECOS-M, a mining hotel firm that serves as an intermediary between the venue and miners. Founded in 2017 in Armenia, ECOS-M started by building a mining venue near the country’s Hrazdan thermal power plant. So far, ECOS-M has set up two containers in Hrazdan, but hopes to expand significantly as the potential capacity of the site is up to 200 megawatts, ECOS-M managing partner Ilya Goldberg said. But the partnership with Rosenergoatom, which he says is “very comfortable” for ECOS-M, is even more promising.If ECOS-M manages to fill the field in Udomlya fast, Rosenergoatom will open other venues for mining, said Nemchenkov. “This is the company we’re planning to go a long way with,” he said.According to the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by ECOS-M and Rosenergoatom in February, in addition to Udomlya, four more Rosatom venues might be filed with miners in the coming years, two of them in Siberia, one in the northern region of Murmansk and one in the Kaliningrad exclave in the West.  One of these venues, located in the Siberian town of Seversk, is an especially ambitious project, Nemchenkov said: With a potential capacity up to 200 megawatts, the site is expected to fit 84 containers for one megawatt each at the beginning, after construction is finished, tentatively scheduled for late 2021. Some 130 more megawatts of available electricity are waiting for miners near the Kolskaya and Baltic nuclear power plants and Angarsk Electrolysis Chemical Plant, according to the MOU. For Rosenergoatom, building mining venues for rent is a by-product of the company’s ambition to become a large data center provider. The political situation is conducive to this business: in early December, Russia passed a law prohibiting storage of Russian citizens’ personal data abroad. This means any company dealing with Russians’ personal data will have to store it on servers inside Russia or pay up to $290,000 in fines and get blocked in the country. Another law, passed in 2016, requires all telecom companies to store their clients’ communication data for up to three years, further stimulating demand for storage. The data center in Udomlya has a backup diesel generator, which ensured uninterrupted service for clients during a brief outage at the Kalinin power station last year caused by a short circuit in a transformer outside the plant, Nemchenkov said. While the mining field doesn’t have such generators, an outage there in extreme conditions would only last one or two minutes, he said.Rosenergoatom seems serious about working with miners: According to Nemchenkov, there will be an option to hire the nuclear giant’s personnel to take care of the mining containers and leverage its engineering and industrial safety expertise. It might also provide the metal containers in the future, Nemchenkov said. However, the infrastructure the company is building can serve various use cases, Nemchenkov said. If one day Russia bans crypto, or mining in particular, the venue can be upgraded and turned into a normal data center, he said.“For the time being, we can host miners. If the mining story is over, we can host something else,” Nemchenkov said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

CTO Jameson Lopp will remain in his current position but will join the board along with Neuman.Welch’s decision to step away from his position was linked to personal matters and not the firm’s product decisions, Welch and Neuman said.Meanwhile, Casa is getting rid of its node; well, at least its physical implementation. Neuman told CoinDesk in an interview the firm will ditch its purple-and-white hardware product in favor of bolstering its subscription service. Welch told CoinDesk in October the company had shipped more than 2,000 devices to buyers in over 65 countries.Casa Node will now be run on open-source software available on most any computer which can be paired with a $10 monthly subscription to its key service. As Neuman said, it’s equivalent to bitcoin key management for the cost of a Netflix subscription.When asked about possible revenue concerns – given that the lowest Casa Node package currently runs for just under $400 – Neuman said the firm is looking to capitalize on a strong 2019. For Casa, that means learning from its customers.“A lot of people weren't coming to us for the cost. They were coming to us for the security, the peace of mind,” Neuman said. “We don’t expect this to materially affect our revenue as a company.”As for other Casa Node features, Neuman said the firm is close to integrating with Coldcard, a bitcoin-only wallet. Generational bitcoin payment plans via inheritance services and different service accounts similar to a checking and savings account are also in the lineup, he said.“Our main focus is around the success that we’ve seen so far and the growth that we expect to continue to see through this year,” Neuman said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

(Open Privacy founder Sarah Jamie Lewis cheekily refers to herself as a cyberpunk witch on Twitter.) “I think witchcraft and crypto are deeply involved with each other,” Gallant said.After all, Gallant said, technology is “a little bit magic to us,” something that is spoken (and coded) into existence. Beyond that, cryptocurrency can enhance witches’ power by letting them transact beyond the grasp of restrictive mainstream commerce platforms.“Whether it’s ritual objects or access to birth control in various places around the world … that whole scale applies to crypto as it applies to cash,” Gallant said, describing her interest as primarily feminist. “If you don't have privacy and security, you don’t own yourself anymore. So cryptocurrency is important for that.”Although witches often use TikTok and Instagram to share spells and recipes, they have not always been welcome on e-commerce platforms. Etsy temporarily banned witchcraft-related sales in 2015, just as eBay did in 2012. Taboo or occult religious practices can sometimes be subject to financial censorship due to potential reputational risks. In 2017, witches reported being banned by Square for selling “occult” items. That’s why feminist author Sophia Digregorio publishes manifestos about “How Witches and Occultists Can Use Bitcoin and Altcoins for Privacy and Anti-Discrimination.”From Gallant’s perspective, the right to purchase objects for her own personal use is crucial. Even as these issues apply to all religious minorities, they are more likely to be censored if the person violating social norms is a woman. Open Privacy’s Lewis found a similar motivation herself. She and Gallant are among the many crypto enthusiasts who incorporate spirituality into their tech experiments.“When someone asked if I was an activist or a researcher, I told them I was a witch,” Lewis said. “We’ve delegated what is ‘appropriate’ to sell, advertise or even believe to some extent to these platforms,” Lewis added, referring to platforms like eBay that have temporarily banned or penalized occult shops. For a more recent example, the organizers behind the witchcraft pen-pal project Witch Swap, which helps witches share books, crystals, tarot cards and other ritual tools, said they created a backup Instagram account after the original account wrongly triggered the platform’s community standards enforcement. On the other hand, Kelsey Lester-Perry, the entrepreneur behind KVLT Kreations online shop, said she accepts bitcoin although Etsy and Instagram still work for such sellers and novice learners most of the time. “I get the best information from just having a dialogue with my community on Instagram,” Lester-Perry said. “There are certain keywords that you shouldn’t put in an Instagram post, like you shouldn’t use dollar signs. Their bots will catch those if you say the word ‘giveaway.’”Yet, as the Witch Swap instance shows, accounts that promote witchcraft but don’t sell or directly distribute occult products can still attract scrutiny. All things considered, many tech-savvy witches believe the types of systems-thinking used in astrology or tarot deck readings can also apply to cryptocurrency ecosystems. And they see this technology as crucial to ensuring their future rights to freedom of religion, both in terms of commerce and self-expression.“The acceptable norms are shrinking,” Lewis said. “We need these technologies and avenues to push back against that shrinkage. Without them, we live in a much smaller word.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

summer-long ...","Jan 13, 2020 at 21:15 UTC","Craig S. Wright, one of crypto’s most litigious engineers, struck a minor victory in court last Friday. ","United States District Judge Beth Bloom said facts previously established in the trial were now in dispute, according to a court document filed Jan. 10 to the District Court of Southern Florida.This is the latest turn in an ongoing trial brought by Ira Kleiman, brother to Wright’s deceased business partner David Kleiman. Kleiman is suing for half of an $8.87 billion fortune (1.1 million bitcoin), said to be encrypted in a “Tulip Trust.” Concluding a summer-long sanctions and contempt hearing, District Magistrate Bruce Reinhart found the nChain chief scientist in contempt of court for failing to produce a full list of his bitcoin holdings acquired before Dec. 31, 2013. Reinhart awarded Kleiman $650,000 in legal expenses, and deemed it a fact that the plaintiff retains a 50/50 ownership in Wright’s assets and intellectual property, developed jointly with David Kleiman. Reinhart also questioned the validity of Wright’s testimony, describing it as “contradictory.” Wright called these sanctions “draconian.”Justice Bloom now says the facts are unsettled. The previous hearing was focused solely on the amount and location of Wright’s bitcoin, she said, so Wright’s partnership with David Kleiman was beyond Judge Reinhart’s remit. She also asserts the amount of bitcoin at the center of the case “remains an issue.” Wright was granted a request to extend a period of discovery so that a “mysterious” bonded courier can unlock the encrypted Tulip Trust. Wright claims the trust is currently inaccessible because several keys are held by an unnamed intermediary. Wright has until Feb. 3 to file a notice with the court that the courier “has appeared from the shadows.” “The Court questions whether it is remotely plausible that the mysterious ‘bonded courier’ is going to arrive, let alone that he will arrive in January 2020 as the Defendant now contends,” Bloom writes. Wright previously testified it would be “impossible” to comply with the court order to identify his bitcoin before the bonded courier returned 100 percent of the assets to his control on Jan. 1, 2020.Wright has not confirmed publicly whether the courier arrived and has not moved bitcoin said to be held in the trust.One day before Justice Bloom’s reversal, evidence of a third Tulip Trust entered the public court record, which could overturn much of what was previously known about the case. In the original Trust document, it’s claimed Wright entrusted all his cryptographic assets to David Kleiman in 2012, to be returned in full eight years later. This directly challenges Ira Kleiman’s allegation that Wright expropriated his brother’s bitcoin. Elsewhere, Kleiman has submitted communications from Wright showing he's owed 30 percent of the trust's holdings.Questions over the legitimacy of the Tulip Trust document have been floated, as it contains a font type created in 2015. Wright said this is due to a court scanner using a newer version of the font.Buried among 428 other documents, the Tulip Trust III filing may contain evidence as to who actually has ownership over bitcoin mined jointly by Wright and the late Dave Kleiman. The document’s details are unknown, and Wright has requested it remain sealed. He was granted 10 days to produce a redacted version.Wright submitted the document “without any explanation as to its late disclosure, or even an email” signaling its production, according to plaintiff's counsel Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP.In the most recent filing, Judge Bloom upheld a view that Wright willfully obstructed the court proceedings, and upheld a sanction for Kleiman’s legal fees.“[Wright] was evasive, refused to give and interpret words in their very basic meanings, was combative and became defensive when confronted with previous inconsistencies,” Bloom writes. Kleiman is represented by Kyle Roche and Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP, while Wright is represented by Rivero Mestre LLP. Neither party had responded to a request for comment by press time. Having offered to resolve the dispute amicably, Wright reignited the trial on Oct. 31. Since then, both sides have produced a bevy of pre-trial filings, working under a compressed schedule. In December, Wright’s counsel produced 18,669 documents to the plaintiff.The case continues this week with depositions from Wright, his wife Ramona Watts and Andrew O’Hagan, who interviewed Wright at length for an essay in the London Review of Books.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

When a user transfers tokens, the bridge's smart contract locks the originals and mints a corresponding amount of new tokens on the other chain. Using the system, ether-based tokens can be transformed into RSK's RRC20 tokens, which conversely can be turned into ethereum ERC777 tokens. Interoperability protocols make it easier for projects to operate on different blockchains. Decentralized apps (dapps) can cater to a broader base of users, who would otherwise remain siloed in closed networks, and projects can leverage specific characteristics of different blockchains simultaneously. “Interoperability has been a cornerstone of the RSK vision from the start,"" explained Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at IOV Labs. ""We believe being able to offer Bitcoin’s benefits to Ethereum users and to connect these respective developer communities is a crucial step for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.""There are other protocols offering interoperability between bitcoin and ethereum: Wanchain launched a token bridge between the two networks in 2018. Edelman told CoinDesk that while Wanchain focuses on connecting blockchains by being a ""middleman,"" RSK is different in that it actually combines the networks, allowing both ecosystems to leverage the other's strengths.Bitcoin stablecoin protocol Money on Chain, which uses bitcoin as collateral for new tokens, has already said it will use the new RSK bridge to cross its stablecoins onto the ethereum ecosystem. The project's co-founder Max Carjuzaa said the new interoperability would combine the security and ""global recognition of Bitcoin with the vibrant DeFi ecosystem currently developed in Ethereum.”Last September, IOV labs said it would integrate RSK tokens into its newly acquired Spanish-language social media network, Taringa. Further information regarding any possible integrations with the interoperability bridge will be released in the coming months, a spokesperson said.

While most blockchain projects rely on Amazon Web Services and other behemoths for essential infrastructure, Urbit goes back to first principles. And 2020 could be Urbit’s big moment. After years of trickling development, and not a little controversy owing to its connections to an online fringe movement, the project finally plans to ship. Urbit quietly has built bitcoin integrations and added an iconic crypto personality to its roster of developers: Bitcoin Sign Guy. B.S.G., also known as Christian Langalis, made headlines as a 22-year-old holding up a “Buy Bitcoin'' sign behind then-Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. Captured on C-SPAN, a screenshot became a widely circulated meme across the crypto space, and Bitcoin Sign Guy an inadvertent hero. After years of laying low, Langalis wants to see bitcoin gain mass adoption and thinks his work with Urbit is the way to do it. “Sound money deserves a sound computer,” Langalis is fond of saying.Urbit enables anyone to run his or her own server, with far more ease than current available options. Instead of handing personal data to Facebook and Google for the privilege of using their platforms, users maintain ownership for themselves. It’s built as an alternative to the centralized web, where nearly all activity is managed by a handful of monoliths. At its core, Urbit is a way of marrying all online services – including a user’s social graph, messages and photo collections – to a stable identity.“We've built Urbit to be a cloud-native computer that you can use for your whole digital life,” Galen Wolfe-Pauly, CEO of Tlon, the startup primarily responsible for developing Urbit, said in an email. “To really satisfy that, Urbit users have to be able to transact with one another.” Sound money deserves a sound computer.Langalis is a project lead at Tlon, where his main remit is to integrate bitcoin into the ecosystem. If Urbit needs a currency to fulfill its aims of complete digital citizenship, Langalis thinks bitcoin needs a decentralized platform to be used “safely and effectively.”Bitcoin and Urbit, he thinks, form a symbiotic pair (and a nice portmanteau), representing a move towards a fully realized, decentralized existence. At the heart of both bitcoin and Urbit is the notion of digital sovereignty, meaning users aren’t beholden to the coercive effects of a higher authority. “Much as bitcoin seeks a return to neutral monetary systems, Urbit seeks neutral computing infrastructure,” Langalis said in a phone call. Though Tlon is moving slowly with the integration – the firm placed a single bounty to add bitcoin to the Urbit wallet on Dec. 9 – bitcoin will ultimately serve as “money primitive” for the ecosystem looking to out-compete the internet. After the wallet will come a node implementation, lightning capability and user-designed apps denominated in the cryptocurrency. There will also be an Urbit storefront page.“The litany of bitcoin stuff we’re working on is growing by the day. It started with a bitcoin node and is moving to custodying keys like MacOS and creating an atomic swap between bitcoin and Urbit address so you won’t need to own anything but bitcoin to purchase an Urbit address,” he said. The features should ship in Q2. Langalis approached Tlon over the summer and suggested its developers integrate bitcoin. At the time, Langalis had been attending Urbit Meetups in San Francisco for a year and half. His interest in the operating system stemmed from his obsession with bitcoin. A self-defined “bitcoin maximalist,” Langalis fell down the rabbit hole searching for virtual liberty. He started using virtual privacy networks (VPN) to cloak his internet activity but was frustrated by their unreliability. He  invokes American whistleblower Edward Snowden when saying, “Privacy protections might have a minor effect, but you’re still being tracked.” After failing to spin up his own email server – it was beyond his technical knowledge – Langalis searched and found that “all the things I wanted to do, that I couldn’t, are possible with Urbit.”Namely, Langalis wants to own his data and make sure it never leaks. “People have strong affinity with Urbit if they value digital sovereignty, demand secure and robust systems, and prefer that systems are as simple as possible from a ‘dev’ perspective,” he said. In this sense, Langalis said bitcoin proves itself again and again to be the most secure chain. “It’s the only credible option for cryptocurrency being money.” Money – at least on the internet – is just another form of data. One of bitcoin’s major breakthroughs was in solving the double-spend problem, removing the need for a trusted third party to verify if a sequence of bytes is legitimate. That means bitcoin is as the code says.However, a decade after the protocol was first released, bitcoin is rarely used as the peer-to-peer payment system for which it was theorized. Bitcoin exists on exchanges, in custodial wallets, and on platforms that run on third-party servers. This reintroduces the risks – of security and coercion – that bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, sought to mitigate. “Bitcoin itself is quite hardened, but all of the tools we use to interact with it are questionable,” Nic Carter, co-founder of the VC Castle Island Ventures, said in a Telegram exchange. He's said previously he knows of a number of exchanges that run on centralized cloud servers but wouldn’t name them. Langalis, too, is skeptical of bitcoin infrastructure that relies on a centralized server or service, which could theoretically expose users to “state coercion.” “Feds will limit the control you have over your BTC, enforce KYC, expropriate it, etc,” he said.Urbit and bitcoin are only the beginning of the mouse war against the cat called the authoritarian internet.In this sense, Urbit, as a decentralized computing system, is a way to return security to bitcoin, by returning it to its peer-to-peer state. “The less systemic we can make bitcoin usage, the more stable it is,” he said. “Making it easier for people to run Bitcoin nodes, sign Bitcoin transactions, and engage in online commerce is part of how Urbit will address this objective.”Still, Alexander Bard, the Swedish cyber-philosophist, sees a bumpy road ahead for such endeavors.   “Urbit and bitcoin are only the beginning of the mouse war against the cat called the authoritarian internet, exemplified by Xi Jinping's idea of himself as the Chinese Messiah and the NSA as its infantile mimicry,” he said.There are 13 servers that run the domain name system (DNS) hierarchy, the backbone of the internet as most know it. Like other components of the web, this decision was a contingency of the internet’s haphazard development over the past half century. “We’re inundated by a technical debt of large mainframe computers and networks that were bolted together,” said Kenny Rowe, a consultant for Tlon, working on integrating ethereum to Urbit, and early contributor on MakerDAO. The history of the internet is essentially one of rapid development being outpaced by growing demand. Protocols like Unix and HTTP, the foundational blocks of the web, are arguably ill-equipped to meet the strain of modern computing. These systems have been patched and hacked over time, leading to inefficiencies and vulnerabilities, he said. And the problems will only compound as more and more of daily life goes digital.Urbit’s designers made the choice to throw everything away and build a new stack. “A reboot was needed because you can’t reform the centralized system. You can only build on top of it,” Rowe said. The new stack starts with a bespoke programming language, Hoon. They also built a virtual machine, an operating system, and a peer-to-peer network. “This is like inventing the personal computer, the internet, email, and FTP [File Transfer Protocol, a way to send files] all at the same time. The goal is nothing less than a complete overhaul of the personal computer and internet,” Rowe said.Though Urbit is a complete reworking of personal computing, there are parts that closely mirror the conventional web. Urbit’s routing system is composed of 255 galaxies, 65,000 stars and four billion planets, with 4.3 trillion moons, which, in turn, function similarly to DNSs, ISPs, personal computers and devices that connect to them. The difference “is that Urbit IDs are owned cryptographically by many different people,” according to a company blog. In other words, there’s not a centralized unit that distributes network participants. Galaxy Urbits distribute star Urbits, and star Urbits distribute planet Urbits, forming a communication and identification layer over the network of personally run servers. But it’s not an immutable arrangement; each Urbit is free to move to other parts of the universe if it wants. And, despite the cosmological address hierarchy, communication between network participants is designed to be peer to peer. Individual Urbits are represented by a human readable namespace and have a cryptographic passkey to log in to the operating system. These Urbit IDs are stored on the ethereum blockchain. Like other cryptographic assets, Urbit IDs have value. Users are expected to pay a nominal fee for them so the network isn’t inundated by low-effort trolls or spammers. Reputation is highly valued by the developers. Though bad actors cannot be kicked off the platform at large – as is possible in a centralized client/server relation, like Twitter disabling an account associated with making threats – Urbit’s galaxies or stars can refuse to validate these users, essentially leaving them floating in space. Isolated, but not deplatformed, these users will still maintain complete ownership over their data. And unlike the traditional internet where namespaces, URLs and webpages are mutable, a user’s Urbit preserves an immutable record of their communications, similar to how reputations follow you around in meat-space.Urbit was conceived in 2002 by Curtis Guy Yarvin, a contentious figure in the tech scene for his political writings, under the nom du plume Mencius Moldbug, that argue for the replacement of democracy with an authoritarian, neo-monarchist order. Yarvin’s sprawling, esoteric blog posts are thought to have inspired the alt-right, and have been read by some as supporting race science and slavery. For the next 11 years, Yarvin built the guts of Urbit, all while blogging about CEO-kings ruling a patchwork of nations. In 2013, he raised $1.1 million from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, and launched Tlon (named after a parallel universe in a Jorge Luis Borges story). A team of five began turning Yarvin’s vaporware into an operational cloud computing system. Then, in early 2019, shortly after Urbit ID was deployed to the ethereum blockchain, Yarvin announced he would step down from the corporation and project. “I'm a thinker, not a doer; an explorer, not a leader; an author, not a maintainer. My goal was always to fire myself at the first possible opportunity. I'm super happy to reach it,” he wrote at the time. Unlike Satoshi, who also walked away from a functioning system, Yarvin left behind a divisive legacy that still follows the project.“Curtis had the audacity to try to tackle the problem of building the whole stack,” Wolfe-Pauly, who came to the project in 2013, said. “Most of the people who have come to work on this project, myself included, had dreamed about doing this. Curtis' original designs worked well to motivate other people to actually realize them. He was never the guy to actually see it through.” In Yarvin’s own words, “For me, there are always two Urbits: the Urbit that exists, and the Urbit that should exist.” Yarvin did not respond to a request for comment.“Urbit has evolved quite some distance from Curtis' original sketch. It's sort of like Urbit in 2013 was a PhD thesis — and we've taken it from a paper to a reality,” Wolfe-Pauly said. According to him, the system has been almost entirely rewritten by the current Tlon team, in preparation of onboarding the general public. Under Yarvin’s stewardship, the working directive was to ship a basic model and encourage only the technically proficient to begin playing with the system.In the first quarter of 2020, Tlon plans to ship the first complete release of Urbit. The designers have called it the “Nokia 3310 of cloud computers,” perhaps an oblique reference to Yarvin’s work developing microbrowsers for cell phones, early in his career. At launch, the system will essentially function like Slack, a place for communities of people to chat and share links. Tlon has been using this feature day to day, and is working on a G Suite-like service for Urbit.This version of the operating system will exist on an internet browser, until an app is launched as a part of OS 2 in the second quarter. It’s with this second upgrade that peer-to-peer cryptocurrency payments in bitcoin and ethereum will be possible. “Think CashApp for Urbit,” Langalis said.Considering the slow pace of development and that Urbit has yet to be audited, not everyone in the early ecosystem is convinced this is a good thing. “Urbit is definitely not a sound computer, and won't be for a while yet. I'll trust it with my bitcoins after I trust it for everything else. It has to succeed at its own mission before it can succeed as a wallet,” said Brenton Milne, an Urbit hobbyist or “Martian.”Urbit is often explained as a digital homesteading experiment. It’s a way to drop off the grid and return to the basics of computing. Today, a handful of corporate entities control most of the activity online. MEGACORP, as these commercial entities are called in Urbit’s parlance, set the parameters of discourse and often have total say over a user’s experience. Platforms like Facebook, Google and Medium offer users a tradeoff: use our servers in exchange for your data, often without limits on what they can do with it. “I think it's been very damaging to society to have our means of communication be optimized for the profit of platform owners rather than the interests of their users, and I think that this has led to mass psychology being damaged – outrage and conflict keep people clicking,” said decentralized web enthusiast Dave Kammeyer, CEO of Mentality.io, a machine learning startup. Rowe, the Tlon consultant, doesn’t think the traditional web is going anywhere, but that Urbit offers users a chance of setting up a geodesic dome insulated from some of the more pernicious features of the “surveillance web.” Milne thinks Urbit has a ""long-shot potential to upend the internet,"" but another likely scenario is it merely develops into a sustainable ecosystem for geeks and hackers. “What bitcoin is to paper money, Urbit is to land,” said Justin Murphy, an author and political scientist interested in internet subcultures. “The more bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies penetrate our everyday lives, I think, the more people will want their entire computing experience to be similar.”  Carter sees the circle running in the opposite direction: If Urbit provides a meaningful identity ""disentangled from meatspace"" it will become ""a vital tool in catalyzing the closed-loop bitcoin economy.""Speaking to his years of pseudo-anonymity as Bitcoin Sign Guy, Langalis said he never wanted his reputation to overshadow his work for bitcoin. “It was an identity I enjoyed being, but I didn’t want to get typecast as that guy.” Two years on, he’s just as tenacious about building bridges and evangelizing for bitcoin. “Urbit is the way I can contribute.” The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Who are the mysterious big players behind this magical technology that allegedly solves all of bitcoin's problems?  ","Lightning is one of the most promising technologies in the space right now, even drawing in Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Given current technical constraints, blockchains don't support many users, let alone the world's population. Lightning could multiply the transactions possible, while making transactions faster (like a millisecond) and cheaper. Nerds have eagerly been putting the technology to the test. A range of lightning games has come out, such as one channeling the hit game Fortnite. And it's possible to buy Domino's pizza and Amazon gift cards with this new internet money. But while, yes, lightning sort of works, there's a lot of work to be done. The technology is still risky and not easy to use. Although the theory's there, how it plays out in practice remains to be seen. Here's a breakdown of the big players across the globe tinkering with the underlying technology every day, trying to improve it so it doesn't ""suck"" anymore.The lowest-level coders are working on so-called lightning implementations, the code that puts the payment network into practice. Each has its own approach to the network.The best-known of these is LND, created by Lightning Labs, with CEO Elizabeth Stark at the helm. Dorsey invested in the firm early in 2018.Behind the scenes, there are many more developers working on implementations such as Blockstream's c-lightning and France-based Acinq's Eclair. While the developers behind each of these softwares tend to focus on different features, and they're written in different programming languages, all three are interoperable, meaning transactions can be sent between them with no bumps. To this day, developers from these three groups continue to hold bi-weekly IRC chats to discuss future changes to the protocol specifications.To confuse matters further, there are still other lightning implementations on the fringe. With a decentralized payment network, anyone can make their own version.Rust-lightning is a security-minded implementation headed by Square Crypto engineer Matt Corallo, who's been writing bitcoin code since he was a teenager. Japan-based startup Nayuta has built a lightning implementation specifically geared toward the Internet of Things. As more and more devices, whether toasters or TVs, connect to the internet and gather data, these same devices may need to make tiny payments, too, to say, automatically charge an electric car, the company contends. And bitcoin's lightning may be the only payment system in the world that allows for payments that small. None of these coders is flashy. They put out announcements about how they've successfully created ""multi-path payments"" or ""watchtowers"" from time to time. While clouded in esoteric tech-speak, these announcements essentially mean that the technology is improving, and hopefully getting easier to use. This is all happening in the background. But what about actually using lightning, even if it's risky? Right now it's not easy. Most of the most-used wallets out there, such as Coinbase and Blockchain.info, don't support lightning payments yet because the technology is still experimental. (There are exceptions, such as Electrum, a long-standing light-client wallet that added support for lightning last year.)For the most part, a parallel ecosystem of daredevil developers have been creating completely separate bitcoin wallets that allow users to send and receive lightning payments. There's a lot to choose from. Acinq's mobile wallet Phoenix is one of the oldest and most-employed non-custodial wallets, meaning users have full control of their private keys.Lightning desktop wallet Zap started as a one-person side project by young developer Jack Mallers. One feature of the wallet power users love is that it hooks up with what's known as a ""bitcoin node."" This stores every on-chain bitcoin transaction made in its 11 years, the most secure way of using bitcoin. Zap lets you make lightning transactions from your smartphone, while running one of these clunky full nodes at home.Wallets like Breez and BlueWallet are taking different approaches to building a slicker interface for lightning. And that's just the tip of the lighting bolt.All this assumes users already have bitcoin.If they do, they can use one of these wallets to send to a lightning ""channel,"" like a separate specialized bitcoin account secured by a smart contract that lets you start making lightning payments.But if users want to buy lightning-powered bitcoins directly with USD, skipping a step, they enter a highly experimental realm. Most other major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase and Huobi don't have that capability yet while the technology is still maturing. BTCC, for example, told CoinDesk that ""[m]ost people do not understand Lightning Network at present. We will support Lightning Network a bit later to acquire more user adoption.”Exchange Bitfinex is the largest exchange so far to adopt lightning, meaning users can deposit or withdraw payments in the experimental form of the digital currency. But this makes up a small overall percentage of its transactions so far. Meanwhile, Breez lets users in 35 countries buy and sell lightning directly with a credit card.While adoption across bitcoin companies is minimal for now, the goal for many of these players on the vanguard fringe of bitcoin is that once lightning is mature enough, most bitcoin wallets and exchanges will absorb it. If user experience challenges don't get in the way, lightning could one day become the dominant method of bitcoin payments. It offers cheaper and faster payments, after all. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The initial 300 MW of power was expected to come online in the first quarter, with 1 GW planned to be achieved late in the year.Soon after Whinstone broke ground on its Texas project the company was acquired by Germany-based Northern Bitcoin, which already runs a bitcoin mine in Norway that harnesses renewable power. Similarly, Texas may have been chosen as the site for this major venture in part due to its availability of cheap wind power, according to Bloomberg.

It's a variation on the so-called sabotage attack, in which malicious miners try to wreak havoc on bitcoin for the sake of wreaking havoc, rather than for profit.“Purge attacks probably don’t constitute a bigger risk than other known forms of sabotage attacks, but seem like an interesting spin,"" he wrote. In the dystopia of the ""Purge"" films, the U.S. government legalizes all crime for one night every year to unleash a sort of national catharsis. Hasu said he chose the name ""because the attacker doesn’t (primarily) steal money himself, he makes theft legal in the network for a short period of time.""In short, the attack opens the possibility that in very particular circumstances some users could spend their bitcoins more than once, something the unique technology behind bitcoin is supposed to prevent.To be clear: The scenario is hypothetical, like many others bitcoin researchers have identified in their efforts to steel the network against real-world sabotage attempts. Anticipating the danger is a first step toward preventing or at least mitigating it.In order to execute a purge attack, a rogue miner would replace an already accepted block with an empty one, pushing transactions that were previously seen as final back into the ""mempool,"" which is like a waitlist for transactions. Then, anyone who sent a transaction during that time can spend the same coin twice.The new type of sabotage could be used to ""undermine trust in bitcoin's assurances,"" such as the assurance that transactions are after a time ""final,"" meaning irreversible.  ""Possible attackers could include nation-states hostile to bitcoin as well as terrorist organizations,"" Hasu added.Further, Purge is different from other sabotage attacks because the users who are suddenly allowed to double-spend could get incentive to go along with the attack. ""Because Purge gives normal users a way to benefit from the attack, the attacker hopes that it will be harder to coordinate a response quickly because whoever benefited from the attack has an incentive to defend the attack chain,"" Hasu told CoinDesk.But while Purge is a new idea, it’s not necessarily worse than other known attacks. Hasu also points to a couple of lines of defense: One, the risk to the attacker of losing block rewards, which are expensive to win and could decline in value if the attack shakes confidence in bitcoin; and two, the “strength of bitcoin’s pre-coordination.”The full report (on bitcoin futures exchange Deribit's blog) dives into much more detail.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitmain ...","Feb 5, 2020 at 19:10 UTC",The coronavirus outbreak in China may impose a longer-term impact on the bitcoin network’s mining activity at a time when an estimated 65 percent of its computing power is located there.,"While Chinese miner manufacturers see rising demand for new equipment ahead of bitcoin’s scheduled halving in May, they estimate the disease may limit growth in bitcoin mining power if the situation isn’t resolved in the near future because it is difficult to expand or build new machines, according to Kevin Shao, general manager of Canaan Creative's blockchain arm. Shao told CoinDesk that while there is little doubt miners can maintain the current level of computing power, there is a shortage of new mining machines.So far, almost every bitcoin miner maker in China – Bitmain, Canaan, MicroBT and InnoSilicon – faces delays in production and delivery. Bitmain and Canaan, the world’s top two miner makers by market share, have published notices saying the delay of after-sale services until Feb. 10. Customers want new, top-of-the-line mining models to expand existing mining facilities and replace older machines in anticipation of the bitcoin halving, currently expected to occur sometime in May 2020.“One of the most affected businesses is our mining machine production,” Abe Yang, chief operating officer at PandaMiner, told CoinDesk.Founded in 2013, the Shenzhen-based firm makes mining machines and provides computing power services with nine mining farms. “Not only us, most miner makers have been affected by the outbreak since their factories are based in cities like Dongguan and Shenzhen in Guangdong province,” Yang said. “During the extended vacation until Feb.10, almost all the production will be halted.” Meanwhile, the lockdown of the city of Wuhan has had a more direct impact on InnoSilicon, whose headquarters is located in the outbreak’s epicenter.“The delay currently has not affected our businesses that much since the extension [of the holiday break] will only be several days,” Shao said. “However, the impact could be much more significant if the outbreak continues for a longer period of time.”  According to data from BTC.com, bitcoin’s mining difficulty – a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards on the bitcoin network – posted 6.57 percent and 7.08 percent growth on Jan. 2 and Jan. 15, respectively. The growth rate dropped to 4.67 percent on Jan. 28 and is estimated to decline to 3 percent in about three days. Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts itself about every 14 days – it goes up or down in positive correlation to whether there are more or less participants racing on the network.“The coronavirus outbreak timespan overlaps with bitcoin’s halving event. The dual factors are apparently affecting the maintenance of mining equipment as well as the delivery of new miners,” Wang Xin, marketing director of WhatsMiner maker MicroBT said in an interview. “As such, the recovery of bitcoin’s hash rate growth will be delayed.”Hash power has more than doubled from around 50 EH/s compared to the same period of last year as bitcoin’s market price climbed over $9,000, according to Shao. “Second-hand miners [mostly older models like Bitmain’s AntMiner S9] that are aiming at a faster payback period, now have a larger risk as they enter a shutdown period ahead of the halving, compared to more powerful new models [like WhatsMiner M20 or AntMiner S17],” said MicroBT’s Wang.Based on f2pool’s profitability index, models like the most widely used AntMiner S9 would have a 30 percent gross margin at bitcoin’s current price with an electricity cost of $0.05 per kWh.However, a lower number of new miners could be good news for those that have already invested in mining equipment with facilities up and running. Existing miners could see more steady mining rewards because there wouldn’t be more competitors to enter the market due to the lack of new mining machines, Canaan’s Shao said. But he added that one way the outbreak would affect existing miners is that many mining machine providers might not be able to offer timely post-sale services to fix malfunctioned devices. Wang said assembly factories have delayed their return-to-business schedule, citing the Chinese government's extension of the Lunar New Year. Businesses in the country have been ordered shut until at least Feb. 10.This is not a crypto-specific issue either. Reuters reported Monday iPhone sales may take a hit because of the coronavirus, if the health emergency can not be contained in the near future. Shao said one of his company’s concerns is slowing logistics, adding, “while we can make all the plans to prepare for the outbreak on our part, logistics is something we can’t control.”Local infrastructure now prioritizes distributing necessities and supplies to those who are affected by the virus over less important deliveries, Shao said. Therefore, some of the customers who pre-ordered miners might not be able to receive the machines on time, and it will take longer to deliver new orders if the outbreak continues, Shao said. Even if employees all return to work, they cannot assemble miners unless their suppliers provide the necessary parts.“If the supplies can not be delivered on time, miner makers are not going to be able to assemble the production,” Shao said. One way companies can take advantage of their inventory is to run the machines themselves to offer computing power to their clients without selling the actual machines, Yang said. This assumes they have the necessary parts to complete assembling miners.“However, the service is not sustainable if the outbreak continues because we would eventually reach full capacity without new machines, creating a shortage in computing power,” Yang said. Mining farms remain unaffected for the moment, but existing quarantine controls and the possibility of an extended outbreak may soon take a toll.Yang said PandaMiner is able to maintain operations for its existing farms, but there will be significant delays in constructing new farms. Two-thirds of the company’s employees did not go home for the Chinese New Year, and have instead been working at the mining sites. However, for those who did go home it will take weeks to return to work, Yang said.Many cities now require a two-week quarantine for people coming back from other areas before letting them go back to work, he said.For example, the Xinjiang autonomous region, an area that hosts a significant portion of mining farms due to its cheap electricity, has implemented strict policies to quarantine not only those coming back from the Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, but also any other province or region, Yang said. “We asked our employees to come back to Xinjiang as early as possible so that they can start the two-week quarantine and go back to work,” Yang said, noting policies may vary among different areas in China. The company’s mining farm in Guizhou is subject to a stricter policy. “We are allowed to let our employees work on site and can only keep a few people to maintain the operation,” he said.Sichuan province, which controls over 50 percent of bitcoin’s hashrate, also requires the two-week quarantine, according to Yang. The lack of on-site staff has already negatively impacted the management of mining farms, Yang said.Employees are responsible for ensuring mining machines are connected to the Internet and have a consistent supply of power. The employees would also need to fix broken circuit boards and other hardware to maintain operations, Yang said. “We usually have at least 10 people on staff to maintain a mining farm,” Yang said. “With much fewer employees, it is hard for us to keep as many machines running as before.”  According to Yang, in some extreme cases where the local government prohibits all employees from working on site,  companies need to negotiate with the government to leave two or three people on duty. Wolfie Zhao contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Bitcoin conference in London on Thursday, in a room with some of ...","Feb 7, 2020 at 19:50 UTC",Why isn't the average person into bitcoin? ,"That was the question posed by Blockstream's Selene Jin at the Advancing Bitcoin conference in London on Thursday, in a room with some of the most hardcore bitcoiners on the planet.Jin pointed out that bitcoiners on Twitter tend to argue that: ""Normies don't understand money, have no long-term vision or the ability to think outside the box."" But she has a different opinion of what's holding back broader adoption. More ""normies"" might use bitcoin if the user experience (UX) was better, if – in Silicon Valley tech speak – they were ""delighted"" to use the apps and felt ""empowered"" by them, she argued. Jin's comments at the two-day event spoke to the difficulty of moving the needle on crypto adoption, even with 11 years under bitcoin's belt.""Bitcoin UX improved a lot [over the years]. But there are ways we can improve that to push bitcoin even further,"" Jin, Blockstream's director of UX, said. She argued that most developers try to build an app with the features they want themselves, which isn't necessarily what the average Joe is looking for.UX is often overlooked in bitcoin's often very technical community. Jin argued that bitcoiners are fascinated by the new currency for a variety of reasons: monetary revolution, technological exploration and getting rich. (She's in it for all three, she said.)""I'm trying to help fix the user experience here because if we don't do that, these three things can't happen,"" Jin said.With the halving around the corner, it could be a particularly good time to focus on improving bitcoin's user experience. If the price goes up (which is still a big ""if"" that people are debating profusely), it could bring in a lot of new users, as is the pattern for bitcoin over the past decade.""Think of it like 'Hungry Hungry Hippos,'"" Coinfloor exchange founder and CEO Obi Nwosu said in a panel, referencing the 1980s children's game. ""When it comes, each exchange will be trying to get as many customers as possible. We need a service that deals with their requirements,"" he added, nodding to Jin's talk.One little-known proposal discussed at the event was to make memorizing bitcoin addresses as easy as memorizing a phone number.Right now that's far from the case. Instead of being fewer than 10 digits, bitcoin addresses, where bitcoin is stored and transaction IDs are long, random strings of letters and numbers.""There is no way anyone can memorize it – unless you're someone who memorizes digits of pi for fun. These IDs are always communicated by copy and paste,"" bitcoin developer and educator Jimmy Song said.That's why, when he saw a proposal for EasyPaySy posted to the bitcoin developer email list, he was intrigued. EasyPaySy allows these accounts to be represented in a much easier form, as short and human-readable as a phone number or as readable as an email address.This approach isn't without downsides. It would require more data to be stored on the bitcoin blockchain (the more slimmed down, the easier it is for more users to run). Plus, users potentially have to spend more time backing up such accounts. One attendee argued that the debacle involving economist and bitcoin critic Peter Schiff recently ""losing his bitcoin password"" showed that taking care of one's bitcoin is already hard enough as is for many people.Still, Song argued that the benefits might outweigh the disadvantages.But user-facing improvements aren't the only changes being considered. Many UX improvements start at the lowest levels of the bitcoin code. The faster developers can build new features, the faster they can bubble up to users. This realm of UX problems was probably the biggest focus of Advancing Bitcoin. One such improvement revolves around ""testnet,"" a network that's like a dummy clone of bitcoin where developers test their apps and new bitcoin features to get a better idea of how they'll work in the real world. Bitcoin Core contributor Kalle Alm has been building SigNet, an alternative that he describes as ""testnet, but without all the broken parts."" The network is notoriously unreliable and ""reorgs"" all the time, an event where transactions that were considered legit for a short time, aren't anymore. This bump is much less common on the real bitcoin network.Plus, there are people mining testnet coins and earning no money from it, since the mined dummy coins are supposed to be free. Alm argues there isn't a point to this, since decentralization, achieved with the help of mining, isn't really required on testnet. ""I don't even know what [testnet miners] are doing. No government is gonna come in and say, 'Give me the test coins!'"" Alm said. With these problems fixed, Alm thinks SigNet could play a big role in testing network-wide features added to bitcoin. For example, developers could soon use it to test Schnorr and Taproot, a privacy and scalability-focused bundle of changes that's been making progress this year. But SigNet is just the tip of the iceberg. New bitcoin smart contract language Miniscript, unveiled last year, was the subject of several talks at the conference. Smart contracts require various conditions to be met in order to unlock and send funds, such as not allowing bitcoins to be sent up until a certain day.Bitcoin's built-in smart contract language Script is notoriously difficult to use, but Miniscript makes it easier for more developers to give it a shot, with the potential of making these smart contracts more available for more users.

Other investors include Slow Ventures, former Goldman Sachs co-head of securities David Heller, Avichal Garg of Electric Capital and Ribbit Capital. The funding round suggests some investors see the San Francisco-based startup as one of the few protocol-oriented firms with a prospective business model.“If bitcoin is going to reach its potential as a viable global currency, it’s going to need to scale beyond the base layer,” Murray said. “Similar to how Visa relieves banks from handling all fiat currency traffic, Lightning relieves the base bitcoin chain from handing all transactions, thus bring more speed and fee efficiency to the network.”Stepping back, Lightning Labs released a beta version of the scaling solution LND in 2018 and previously raised $2.5 million in a seed round from investors including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Square executive Jacqueline Reses, litecoin creator Charlie Lee and former PayPal COO David Sacks. Lightning Labs also launched a mobile wallet app in June 2019, and as of today the company is offering a paid service called Lightning Loop. Loop aims to help merchants manage their payment channels more effectively. Lightning payment channels need to have bitcoin in them in order to stay open, which is a problem for those who actually use these channels without a perfectly balanced in-and-out flow. “Loop ‘in’ helps people put funds into their existing channel … kind of like a prepaid debit card for a lightning account,” Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark said. “Loop ‘out’ is currently the most popular product because it allows people to continue receiving funds on lightning.” This service, which will charge a small percentage of each full loop, helps merchants and exchanges maintain liquidity in the channels. With nearly a dozen lightning startups sprouting up over the past two years, Stark said her startup will distinguish itself by becoming an “infrastructure provider” to other startups.The first Lightning Conference in Berlin attracted 500 participants in 2019, so there may initially be a small pool of developers and service providers willing to pay for back-end support. “The way I see it, there will be an aggregate of financial services, of which Loop is one, and you can batch all of those,” Stark said. “The blockchain becomes an anchor layer for other Layer 2 services on lightning.” One example might include the shopping app Fold, which processed roughly 1,600 lightning payments during the 2019 holiday shopping season. ""We’re growing fast and Lightning Labs’ loop service makes it simple to manage our lightning node’s liquidity, letting our team focus on building out great user experiences that bring lightning to the world,"" Fold's Will Reeves told CoinDesk.Beyond Loop, Stark said her startup will focus on options for larger payment channels in 2020, both opt-in channels that can individually hold more than $1,500 and Atomic Multi-Path Payments, which break payments into smaller parts and are able to return the whole amount if all the small parts don’t promptly arrive at the same recipient.  River Financial CEO Alexander Leishman said his exchange startup, which uses LND to offer users lightning liquidity and trading functions, said Lightning Labs and ACINQ are the only two startups in the space focused on the “nitty gritty” of protocol development. “If it allows us to support larger amounts [of bitcoin] off-chain, it improves the experience for our users. We’ve already had users that are frustrated with the [Lightning Network’s] limits,”  Leishman said. “Services that would make [lightning transactions] easy for us are definitely of interest.”   Stark, who is an adviser to Leishman’s exchange, said her goal for Lightning Labs is to enable automated services so the network will “just work” without clients needing to tamper with channel allocation and flows. The peer-to-peer messaging app Sphinx also uses LND, which Murray said is only possible because of what Lightning Labs is building.  “Lightning Labs is building the channels for bitcoin to fulfill its promise as a medium of exchange, a means of micropayment, as remittance infrastructure, and much more,"" investor Jill Carlson of Slow Ventures said in a press release.Murray agreed, adding he strongly believes the infrastructure behind popular mobile apps will “take a different shape” over the next decade because it will enable direct payments between peers instead of reliance on a third-party provider that monetizes user data.  In the meantime, Stark is optimistically curious about the ability to send “small amounts of data and have payments attached to them.”Speaking more broadly of the batched services Lightning Labs will offer by this time in 2021, she concluded: “These are lightning-native financial services that help improve the network.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company currently has more than 400 bitcoin ATMs deployed in 42 states.“We really wanted to show off the fact that bitcoin adoption is on the rise,” Muhney said of his company’s presence at CES 2020. “The footprint of bitcoin ATMs on a global scale just continues to grow and grow.”As for reactions from people on the floor, Muhney said that booth visitors were “excited to see that it's become so mainstream that they're seeing it at the Consumer Electronics Show.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

We have to rearrange everything.”Since the first patient was identified on Dec. 8  in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, the virus has claimed 80 lives. There were nearly 2,000 confirmed cases as well as 10 cases abroad, including five in the U.S. as of Sunday evening. Given China’s status as a crypto investment hub – it has the most exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region, which in turn has 40 percent of the world’s top 50, according to research firm Chainalysis – professionals like Wu are concerned, to varying degrees, about coronavirus' potential disruption of business and the impact on prices.   Wu said marketing events are crucial for underground crypto investment firms in China to raise money and invest in digital assets, and they are likely to slow down due to the virus.“The market might take a heavy blow if the money stops flowing into these crypto asset classes as it usually did before,” Wu said. While Wu could not estimate how much money Chinese investment has brought into the crypto market, he cited PlusToken, one of the largest illicit crypto firms, as an example. The defunct company gained its notoriety among Chinese crypto holders by raising over $3 billion through a Ponzi scheme. It attracted 789,000 ether, 26 million EOS and 200,000 bitcoins, which is equal to one percent of the outstanding supply. It was shut down by the Chinese government in June 2019. Besides the virus outbreak, the crypto market could be hit with a double whammy with the Chinese New Year, according to Wu. Many Chinese crypto retailers tend to cash in on cryptocurrencies right before the holiday and reinvest in the market in the next year. The Chinese New Year fell on Jan. 25 this year.“The outbreak happens to be at the end of that cycle,” Wu said. “We are not sure when and how much of the money would come back after the holiday.” While Chinese crypto investors are a considerable market force, it is statistically difficult to conclude a one-to-one correlation between the outbreak and moves in the crypto market, said Lingxiao Yang, chief operating officer at Trade Terminal, a Silicon Valley-based crypto hedge fund. “It is really hard to single out one reason that affects crypto trading volumes and market prices, given the data is not always available and transparent in the first place,” Yang said.  Furthermore, the whole market cap of cryptocurrencies is small compared to the stock market, which means many factors could make an impact on the market. However, Yang described a few traits of Asian crypto investors that could make the coronavirus a significant factor to influence the market. Most crypto investors from Asia tend to be retail investors, and historically they became more active around major holidays such as the Chinese New Year, Yang said.“We can’t predict the market prices, but based on our past experiences it tended to get more volatile around those times,” Yang said. “I can see the virus outbreak could potentially lead to more crypto trading for retail investors since they would just stay at home and have even more time to check the market.”It is also difficult to predict market prices as digital assets like bitcoin have a unique set of return drivers, said Kostya Etus, a senior portfolio manager at money management firm CLS Investments. ""Bitcoin isn’t really viewed as a safe-haven asset like gold or cash and it doesn’t have much in common with risk-on assets like stocks either,"" Etus said. ""While most assets are specific to risk-on and risk-off environments, in which you could predict price reactions to certain events, bitcoin is not one of those assets.""  Since crypto is highly speculative, the coronavirus could conceivably have a significant impact on the global market, according to Samuel Lee, a financial advisor at Chicago-based SVRN Asset Management. “The crypto market might overreact to the outbreak since it tends to be irrational compared to the traditional financial market,” he said. On the other hand, Lee said the outbreak is more likely to have a limited effect. “We have seen bitcoin as an asset class went up at the same time when there was the possibility of a war between Iran and the U.S.,” Lee said. “However, the coronavirus might not be that big of a geopolitical influence.” The World Health Organization (WHO) is still debating whether to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency as of the time of writing. “Chinese residents are not scared enough that they want to flee the country,” Lee said.The S&P 500 turned positive even after WHO summoned an emergency meeting on how to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, although Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index and Shanghai A Shares Index have experienced sizable dips recently. ""Most previous regional epidemics appear to have had very limited impact on the equity market, except for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),"" said Wilfred Daye, a senior advisor to boutique investment bank Bardi Co. SARS is an aggressive viral respiratory illness caused by a similar strain of the new coronavirus.""When prolonged epidemics become a market driving factor, the cryptocurrency market will react more sharply,"" said Daye, who also worked as the former head of financial markets at OkCoin.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In addition to Bitmain and Kraken, the suit was filed against Bitcoin ABC developers Amaury Sechet, Shammah Chancellor and Jason Cox.On Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Chris McAliley of the Southern District Court of Florida, dismissed the case without prejudice, meaning the plaintiff can file an amended version of the case. The original complaint alleged Ver, Kraken and the bitcoin cash developers colluded with Bitmain to unfairly redirect hashing power at the exact time the fork was scheduled to take place. Not only did that force the network to implement the Bitcoin ABC design, but it also allegedly caused irreparable harm to the BCH network, to the detriment of UnitedCorp and other stakeholders.UnitedCorp claims this collusion violated U.S. antitrust laws – rules designed to promote competition in the market – and restricted other companies' right to compete. The defendants each filed separate motions to dismiss last year, with some claiming UnitedCorp did not reach the required evidence threshold to proceed with its complaint.  Ver told CoinDesk the amended complaint was unlikely to change the eventual outcome of the dispute. ""My understanding is that means that UnitedCorp basically has lost their case already, but the judge is letting them amend it to see if they can come up with a better argument,"" he said.Sechet and Bitcoin.com have been removed from the list of defendants because UnitedCorp did not serve them in time.

At the time, the group said it could fund long-term development and give ecosystem members a role in deciding which projects get funded. Although the proposal was met with some support, critics pointed out there were many underspecified aspects of the proposal – such as the ""Hong Kong corporation"" that would coordinate and pay for network development – as well as the ""no-debate"" clause that meant any miners who didn't support the soft fork risked having their blocks orphaned.By withdrawing support, Bitcoin.com said there would be a ""great opportunity"" for users to say what they need and for developers to put together clear funding proposals.""In business, you do not begin with a pot of money then figure out something to do with it.

The case was originally filed on Nov. 22, 2019.The following day, it was re-filed in the Southern District of New York with the addition of plaintiff David Crystal.The plaintiffs, who both claimed to be bitcoin traders, alleged Bitfinex and Tether issued inaccurate information and ""monopolized and conspired to monopolize the bitcoin market."" Drawing heavily on the case brought by New York's attorney general last April, they also accused the defendants of manipulating the market by printing unbacked tethers.""When bitcoin prices were falling, Defendants and their co-conspirators printed USD₮s and artificially increased the price of bitcoin,"" reads the original filing. ""Once Defendants and their co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of bitcoin, Defendants and their co-conspirators then converted the bitcoin back into USD₮s to replenish Tether's reserves.""Bitfinex has previously denied the accusations, describing the case as ""mercenary and baseless,"" stating it would contest any ""nuisance settlements"".  In a statement Friday, Stuart Hoegner, general counsel to Bitfinex, said: ""Apparently the plaintiffs have determined that their action should be filed in the Southern District of New York, which raises the question of why it was filed in Washington State in the first place. Whether this complaint is filed in Washington State or the Southern District of New York, it remains entirely meritless and will be disposed of in due course.""It isn't yet known why the plaintiffs decided to re-file the case. According to U.S. law, cases that have already been voluntarily dismissed can never be brought before the court again if dismissed for a second time.In November, Tether published a letter of intent to file a motion to dismiss another separate class action that seeks retribution for manipulating the bitcoin price, claiming damages of more than $1 trillion. The letter, released more than a month after the lawsuit was originally filed, claimed plaintiffs were unable to prove Tether or Bitfinex's involvement.While the dismissal document is not signed by the judge, the case has now been marked as terminated on Pacer, the U.S. court filings portal.

the block rewards into a new zcash-style development fund.","Jan 23, 2020 at 12:30 UTC",A group of bitcoin cash miners is preparing a soft fork to redirect some of the block rewards into a new zcash-style development fund.,"In a Medium post Wednesday, Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of mining pool BTC.TOP, said that a group of some of the largest bitcoin cash mining pools were preparing to soft fork the network to implement a ""short-term donation plan"" that would cut block rewards by 12.5 percent in order to fund network development. ""Investment in software and commons is crucial to secure a bright future for Bitcoin Cash,"" the post reads, arguing that neglect can have a ""damaging"" effect on the network. ""We can avoid these problems by providing an adequate level of stable funding, allowing Bitcoin Cash to thrive and succeed.""Signed by Jihan Wu of Antpool/BTC.com, Roger Ver from Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC's Haipo Yang, Zhuoer's post argues there are ""significant problems"" with the current funding mechanism. Donations are made on a voluntary basis, making it difficult to finance long-term projects and giving corporate donors ""an undue influence"" over developers. Many community members, Zhuoer writes, don't currently contribute anything at all, creating a ""tragedy of the commons"" situation where the self-interest of individuals is contrary to the common good of the network.  It may be controversial, but redirecting block rewards is ""undoubtedly a far better solution"" than the current funding system, the post reads. Many of the same miners included in the post had previously pushed to introduce a ""development tax"" during a CoinGeek BCH conference back in 2018. A report by crypto investment firm Electric Capital found bitcoin cash lost more than 30 percent of its developers between December 2018 and June 2019, the largest drop of any major blockchain network. Because bitcoin cash uses the same SHA-256 hash algorithm as bitcoin, most of the block reward costs will, according to the post, be carried by the dominant bitcoin miners, who constitute approximately 97 percent of the hash ecosystem. Assuming bitcoin cash stays at around $300, Zhuoer calculates the new mechanism could raise more than $6 million in six months. ""It's a clever proposal, with good intent,"" tweeted Emin Gun Sirer, adding that a marginally lower hashrate for steady developer funding was a good trade-off as ""empirically more attacks have been due to underfunded devs than to malicious hashrate.""  But the proposal is not without controversy. Zhuoer's post says BCH blocks that don't follow the soft fork ""will be orphaned,"" meaning they won't be accepted by the five mining pools and risk not receiving any block reward whatsoever.Funds will also be directed into an unnamed ""Hong Kong corporation"" that will coordinate and pay for network development. It's not certain whether this new corporation will pay third-party developers or if it will do most of the work itself, like the Electric Coin Company (ECC) on zcash. In an ask-me-anything (AMA) Reddit session Thursday, Zhuoer clarified that miners would ""ensure the transparency and effective use of all funds"" by the Hong Kong corporation. Antpool's Wu added in the same AMA that many of the details for how the corporation would be governed and how development projects would be prioritized were still ""under discussion.""""There are many underspecified aspects to the proposal,"" Sirer said. ""Specifically, who will manage the collected funds and how will they be distributed?"" That the proposal was sprung on members of the BCH community ""was terrible PR and community management,"" he continued, while the threat of orphaning dissenting blocks risks alienating much of the mining community. It's also disputed whether the five mining pools will be able to force the community to accept their soft fork. At press time, the signatories had a combined BCH hashrate of just under 28 percent, way below the required majority needed to push the soft fork through by themselves. ""They can't enforce this coercive soft fork unless they come up with a lot more hashrate. And it would likely lead to many forks,"" tweeted Charlie Lee, creator of litecoin. ""Adding such a centralizing feature in this coercive manner sets such a bad precedent.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Donoghue. “A bright light has been shined on her activities, and she will now be held to account for her charged criminal acts.”Under the pseudonym “RaptureReloaded,” De Alba allegedly sold narcotics on the dark web marketplace Wall Street Market from June 2018 to May 2019. Customers used encrypted email and bitcoin to purchase drugs from De Alba, who marketed various levels of anonymity for packages sent to the U.S. – such as “Basic Stealth,” “Better Stealth” and “Super Stealth 360,” according to the DOJ.In a January 2019, an undercover Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) agent successfully purchased some 40 grams of narcotics from De Alba, receiving a package in Queens, New York, for around $2,000 in bitcoin.The DEA also intercepted five international packages from the Netherlands and Canada containing narcotics addressed to De Alba’s deceased husband in Southern California. The DOJ alleges De Alba had employed her partner’s identify and credit cards to process transactions since his death in March 2018.“Anonymity is what drug dealers rely on in the dark web, but this case proves it’s a false security,” said DEA Special Agent-in-Charge Ray Donovan. “Law enforcement is committed to tracking down drug traffickers’ distribution networks everywhere.”If convicted of all counts, De Alba faces between five and 100 years in prison.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He said the consortium will roll out this year.First Bitcoin, based in Holon, Israel, has been active in the crypto space for years, offering a bitcoin exchange and ATM services. The SEC temporarily suspended trading of its shares in 2017.First Bitcoin’s network hinges on its recently acquired 2015 patent. U.S. 9,135,787 B1, otherwise known as “Bitcoin Kiosk/ATM Device and System Integrating Enrollment Protocol and Method of Using the Same,” came under First Bitcoin’s control last summer in exchange for 1.6 million shares, according to the SEC filing. Rubin insisted the patent is more than a legal bludgeon. He said he has no desire to become a patent troll, referring to those those who scoop up intellectual property rights and then sue infringers, often frivolously, seeking compensation and damages.“We don’t want to send two big Italian guys with baseball bats” to enforce the patent, Rubin said.Instead, First Bitcoin will use the patent to make inroads among operators. Rubin said the relationship will be mutually beneficial: First Bitcoin will charge a flat transaction fee comparable to ATM fees, and operators will meet local compliance and regulatory burdens via its network.Rubin said small-time operators stand to gain the most from this globalized network“You cannot continue operating like you’re in the Stone Age with 10 machines,” he said. “We will be on top of the regulations, we will be on top of security.

An anonymous official speaking to Yonhap suggested South Korea is considering re-classifying returns made on cryptocurrencies as a type of ""other income,"" placing it in the same category as money earned from lotteries rather than as a form of capital gains, as it is currently treated. Under existing South Korea legislation, a 20 percent rate is levied on 40 percent of total other income; the remaining 60 percent can be tax-deductible. Currently, virtual currencies can be taxed under different schedules, with rates of up to 42 percent under capital gains. South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance has pushed for a new cryptocurrency tax regime for over a month now.  A ministry spokesperson confirmed to The Korea Times in December a ""revised bill"" for enhancing the government's ability to tax cryptocurrencies would be drawn up in the first half of 2020.The official added that no plans had yet been finalized, suggesting the tax plan could be amended or even thrown out by the ministry. Although cryptocurrency taxation is still a very nascent field, the approach taken by the governments in many developed economies has been to treat returns made on cryptocurrencies as a form of capital gains – a tax that is levied on the difference when a sale price exceeds that of the purchase price. The U.S. internal revenue service (IRS), for example, issued guidance in October that reconfirmed the status of cryptocurrencies as a form of property, even when received as a form of income. Depending on a person's income bracket, taxes liable can exceed 39 percent if the cryptocurrency is held for less than a year. In the U.K., cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are classified as commodities and holders can be liable to a 20 percent tax on disposals that altogether exceed £12,000 (~$15,600) in the tax year. But the move by South Korea would bring it closer into line with Japan, which treats cryptocurrencies as a form of miscellaneous income with tax brackets as high as 55 percent, compared to just 20 percent for trading equity. Last summer, the Japanese government said it would take action against traders that it said had not declared cryptocurrency income worth a total of over 10 billion yen ($90.7 million).

However, other metrics such as bitcoin’s correlation to gold suggest that, across the entire body of bitcoin investors, most are using the asset as something far different from ""digital gold.""On ethereum, DeFi has made impressive gains, but the shape of that line and a broader decline in user numbers suggest that the ""web 3.0"" narrative is still in its infancy.Released today, the CoinDesk Quarterly Review surfaces the key data, trends and events shaping crypto markets, in a 45-slide presentation format. It evaluates three different use cases for crypto across more than 25 different data sets. The results of this analysis suggest a dominant narrative for bitcoin and alternative cryptocurrencies has yet to emerge.Readers of this report are introduced to key metrics for tracking shifts in investor interest and global usage of cryptocurrencies. These include bitcoin’s “whale” population, UTXO age distribution, exchange volumes and more. The data-driven takeaways include:Holders of bitcoin who last transacted in the second half of 2017 held through the end of 2019 despite rises in market price that would have made it profitable to sell. This suggests there is investor sentiment for bitcoin as a store of value rather than as a speculative asset. The bump in bitcoin holdings that last moved in late 2018 represents a movement of assets into a more secure form of storage by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in December 2018. Coinbase’s bitcoin-fiat markets, among the world’s most popular for purchases of bitcoin in USD, GBP and EUR, have stalled since 2018. According to data from Nomics, bitcoin-fiat volume has dropped from an all-time high of $46.54 million in 2018 to $44.92 million in 2019. This market is primarily used by investors who view bitcoin as an alternative store of value from traditional currency, and can be thought of as a barometer for buy-and-hold sentiment.  By the end of 2019, there were 2,100 bitcoin addresses holding more $8.5 million worth of BTC each. The growth in these types of addresses, also called bitcoin “whales,” is a rough indicator of large investor participation in cryptocurrencies. Since 2018, the bitcoin whale population has been multiplying at rates not seen since the early 2000s when bitcoin was trading below $100, or 1/85th of its current market price.Off-chain activity on regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. does not show similar signs of increased large investor participation in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency data provider Skew reported a decline in volume for both the CME and Bakkt’s bitcoin futures open interest markets in 2019. These markets, unlike that of other popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Binance, are designed to offer institutional investors regulated instruments for exposure on bitcoin. Institutional participation in cryptocurrencies may be lagging due to persisting imbalances in the underlying liquidity of these assets across various exchanges. One of the breakout successes of 2019 was decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Collectively, these decentralized apps (dapps) managed over $680 million-worth of cryptocurrencies by the end of Q4, according to cryptocurrency data provider DeFi Pulse. Looking at the most popular sub-category of DeFi, cryptocurrency lending, user traction on ethereum continued to climb even when market price for ETH started to decline. In other dapp categories such as gaming and gambling, the number of applications and users decreased in 2019. Cryptocurrency data provider DappRadar reports fewer dapps and dapp users in Q4 2019 than Q1. “In general, we're seeing a rise in the quality of dapps and over time that means fewer dapps launched and fewer dapps attracting a large audience,” said Jon Jordan, communications director of DappRadar. It would seem outside of the DeFi boom on the ethereum blockchain, other dapp platforms and use cases are struggling to grow. For more charts and analysis, download the full CoinDesk Quarterly Review. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Each ""torchbearer"" sends a tiny amount of bitcoin to the next. A key rule is to add a little bit more money to the payment each time it moves to someone new.The goal is to highlight the speed and global nature of the lightning network, a payment technology that could solve or at least greatly ease some of bitcoin's most critical problems. Started on a whim for fun, the torch became a global event, even carried by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, showing how frictionless and indifferent to borders the form of payment is compared to legacy methods like Visa and Paypal.On Sunday, Hodlonaut lit the torch for the second time, in what he described as a ""spur-of-the-moment decision."" Since then, many enthusiasts have been posting lightning ""invoices"" on Twitter to which the torchbearer can send the next lightning payment. It's moving around the world much faster the second time around, already reaching 91 people in three days. ""Made over 30 passes across the globe as I slept!"" Hodlonaut said on Twitter Tuesday morning.Speaking to CoinDesk, Hodlonaut argued that one reason the torch has changed hands so speedily this time is that the big names and companies haven't taken it. ""It has been almost exclusively held by 'plebs,'"" he said. ""There has been no posturing, just lots of enthusiastic, normal bitcoin and [lightning network] users that have passed the torch along promptly, with no fuss.

Despite worries about breaking U.S. sanctions, the torch made it to Iran last March. A group of Venezuelans received the torch with no electricity. In an interesting experiment, they powered their lightning node with a motorcycle battery.The first torch fizzled out when it reached a hard-coded limit on how much lightning can be sent in a single payment. The cap is 4.29 million satoshis, the unit for one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. Developers could lift the cap (which works out to about $370 at current exchange rates) when they think the payment technology is secure enough. Until then, Hodlonaut is eager to see how long the new torch lasts.

The report said that could make digital currencies available to more than 1.5 billion Chinese citizens and 2.5 billion Facebook users – combined, more than half of the world's population. At its current adoption rate, cryptocurrencies are running parallel to the internet during its early years, the report reads. Should this continue, there could be more than 200 million blockchain wallets by 2030, up from the 50 million in 2020. Monday's report is the third in Deutsche Bank's series that examines the future landscape for payments. As the first paper highlights, many existing cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are too volatile to be used as a viable means of payment or as a store of value. The second in the series indicated the inherent benefits of cash mean it would endure as a payments method possibly for decades to come.Although many of these same sentiments are echoed in the third paper, researchers also highlighted that digital currencies could combine the convenience of electronic payments with the privacy of cash payments. In the case of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), they present new solutions for dealing with problems systemic in the global economy.If CBDCs were fully rolled out, Deutsche Bank said, central banks could make interest-bearing accounts available to every citizen. That could ""resolve many problems caused by the current fractional reserve banking system,"" the report reads, and commercial banks would not be ""vulnerable to bank runs"": governments would not be forced into a position where they have to bail out the ""too big to fail"" institutions as they had to do in 2008, researchers said. As part of its research, Deutsche Bank surveyed 3,600 bank clients. Although restricted to a smaller percentage of the population, the report noted a ""stark contrast"" in attitudes between older and younger respondents. While a larger share of the older generation had never held cryptocurrencies or understood how they worked, the report found a ""large majority"" of millennials – those born between 1981 and 1996 – had already traded cryptocurrencies and believed they would be beneficial for the overall economy. Deutsche Bank said in 2017 the opportunities presented to businesses by blockchain technology were ""huge,"" predicting as much as 10 percent of global GDP could be tracked or regulated using the blockchain by 2027.

believes BTC could become the ""native currency"" for the internet.","Jan 22, 2020 at 16:00 UTC",Payments provider Square has won a U.S. patent for a new network that enables seamless crypto-to-fiat transactions.,"Granted Tuesday by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the patent details a payments system allowing users holding different asset types to transact with one another in real-time. ""The present technology permits a first party to pay in any currency, while permitting the second party to be paid in any currency,"" reads Square's application. The network itself can automatically exchange the sender's payment into the asset specified by the receiver. This new system could be especially advantageous for the retail sector, according to the filing. Many cryptocurrencies are too volatile and too slow to become an effective payments solution. Few merchants can feasibly accept a payments method that takes hours to process when the value may swing wildly. But Square thinks it can ""remove barriers"" with a system that features automatic exchange and real-time settlements. Consumers can pay in their preferred asset –  using a privacy coin to keep their identities secret, for example – and merchants receive the full value in an asset they want to hold. The patent suggests the system could be extended to add support for other asset classes including securities, derivatives or loans. Square integrated bitcoin in 2018 and Dorsey has said multiple times he believes BTC could become the ""native currency"" for the internet. Square has generally been reticent on other cryptocurrencies. Asked if the firm planned to add support for other digital coins, the head of the cryptocurrency team said last summer the team remained focused on bitcoin and would continue supporting its network development and mass adoption. Square also announced in a blog post Tuesday it would be releasing a ""Lightning Development Kit"", enabling wallet and app developers to create layer-2 solutions on top of the bitcoin protocol.

The losses amount to around $87,500 at current prices.""We do not know if they successfully extracted any value from an exchange. Advanced risk control systems in exchanges make it likely one or both attacks failed,"" they wrote.""Evidence"" suggests the attacks used mining power obtained through mining power marketplace NiceHash, according to the team. A 51 percent attack is conducted by actors who are able mine a blockchain network with more than half its hashing power, hence the name. This enables transactions to be rewritten, potentially diverting previously spent funds to a different address, as was the case here.Writing on GitHub over the weekend, James Lovejoy, lead maintainer of the vertcoin cryptocurrency and a researcher at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative, said the attacker mined blocks with an address that can be seen here.In another tweet, the bitcoin gold team said: ""We are in contact with exchanges to offer security help and got positive feedback from them. The targeted exchange(s) have already taken effective measures.""While the exchanges were not named, Lovejoy said Binance has increased its withdrawal requirement for BTG to 20 confirmations from 12 since the attack. Based on NiceHash data, the estimate cost to the attacker of each reorg was roughly 0.2 bitcoin (around $1,700), he added – around the amount that would have been given out in block rewards. As such, even if exchanges manage to block the double-spent coins, the attack would have broken even.The is not the first time bitcoin gold has seen such an attack. In May 2018 around $18 million in the cryptocurrency was reportedly double spent.Interestingly, bitcoin gold's value has risen since news of the attack broke. At the time of writing, the price of BTG is around $12.20 – up 18.70 percent over 24 hours.

infrastructure, except they never touch the asset. Soon as we get the ...","Jan 30, 2020 at 17:45 UTC",“You get to talk to lightning nodes with dollars.”,"That’s how Zap CEO Jack Mallers described his lightning wallet’s new U.S. dollar clearing system in a phone interview with CoinDesk. Announced Thursday, the upgrade aims to address a number of hurdles faced by current cryptocurrency payment options.“You can download it, link your bank account, your debit card and you can scan any lightning payment you want,” Mallers said. “Then it will turn around and it will debit your account so that you're using U.S. dollars to interact with the lightning protocol.”“We're using lightning to physically clear and settle the value behind the hood,” he added.Mallers compared Zap’s new infrastructure development to swiping a Visa card, but using Zap’s web of lightning nodes to settle charges. Since users never interact with the digital asset, evergreen crypto concerns such as taxes and volatility melt away, Mallers said. “Merchants can accept bitcoin and lightning payments with the same infrastructure, except they never touch the asset. Soon as we get the cryptographic proof that the lightning payment was made, we just credit their bank account immediately. They're still dealing in dollars,” Mallers said.Zap itself handles additional risk by operating as a quasi-clearing system. While Zap does not collect private keys to operate and maintains the same privacy standards as before, Mallers said, the startup is inherently “short” bitcoin when users transact with its new product.“If you are wanting to send a $100 lightning payment with your Chase bank account, someone has to send that bitcoin for you and then in return we're getting dollars from your Chase account. That means that we're inherently short $100 worth of bitcoin,” he said.In other words, for every transaction in which Zap accepts dollars, the startup’s objective book position expects bitcoin’s position to go down in price. If Zap scales to thousands of users or more, the balance sheet becomes heavily tilted. As such, Zap uses algorithms in real time to hedge its position, Mallers said.“You don't want to have millions of dollars of bitcoin exposure one way or the other because your balance sheet would get crushed,” he said.Zap’s lightning clearing system is the startup’s second major product upgrade in less than six months, with Zap integrating a fiat-to-bitcoin buying feature into its wallet last September. As Mallers told CoinDesk, that product was misguided for commercial use cases – citing tax regulation, bitcoin’s infamous volatility and low consumer adoption for its failure. Mallers said he began looking for a change during the Lightning Conference in Berlin last October.“Pretty much every assumption of mine was just flat out wrong,” he said of the fiat-to-bitcoin product.As a merchant service for lightning, Mallers said Zap sits in a product niche compared to other crypto firms, fraught with its own difficulties. While Coinbase and Square’s Cash App bank on retail investors’ appetite for volatility and speculation, commerce applications demand stability, Mallers said. In its decade-long existence, bitcoin has yet to lend itself to commercial activity. Who wants to pay in bitcoin only to see the price jump 5 percent moments later?Mallers said Zap’s wallet is positioned to bring “normies” into the crypto space for the first time, mainly because of this dollar-denominated front end. For example, marijuana dispensaries in Boulder, Colo., are already using Zap’s new clearing service, offering discounts for joints purchased with lightning-backed dollars. (Mallers’ mother, Brooke, runs a bitcoin-accepting dispensary in Colorado.)“[Dispensaries] are giving up to 10 percent off for people that make these payments, because marijuana businesses typically get charged around 10 percent to process a card payment or they're just not banked at all,” Mallers said. As for his crypto-friendly alternative, Mallers said, “Merchants find it pretty easy.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

in bitcoin's price. But the good days didn't last long after the big 
price ...","Jan 8, 2020 at 12:00 UTC","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Flex Yang is co-founder and CEO of Babel Finance. ","Babel Finance is one of China’s largest financial service providers. The firm works with crypto mining companies to fund the volatile industry and products including crypto-backed loans, deposit services, margin trading and derivatives. Since July 2018, Babel has issued $400 million in crypto-backed loans with a balance of more than $300 million outstanding.Before pivoting to crypto, Yang and his co-founder Del Wang worked in the world of microfinance. Yang’s first venture, Standard Financial Inclusion, provided financial services for the underbanked. Speaking via email, Yang shared his views on the past year in crypto, President Xi’s ambition to “seize” the blockchain opportunity and what China's stablecoin (from its central bank, or PBoC) means for global finance. His responses have been lightly edited for clarity.What have been the biggest events in the crypto industry in 2019? How will these events affect the industry going forward?The two biggest events were connected: the Facebook-led Libra project and China’s pivot towards blockchain technology. These two events are connected in the sense of uncovering blockchain's relationship to currency development. Libra drew the general public’s attention to crypto and blockchain technologies. President Xi’s address on the importance of blockchain technology pushed the government to speed up development of its fiat digital currency program, primarily due to the pressure of Libra on the renminbi (RMB). Both will have a long-term positive impact for the industry.Although Libra will face lots of obstacles and President Xi’s announcement has brought more regulatory attention to crypto in the short term, I believe these two events will help attract more resources and people to the industry and eventually boost the market in the long term.What were the most significant advances for crypto or blockchain technology in China in 2019?Unfortunately, in 2019 I didn’t observe any significant advances in blockchain technology. On the other hand, I observed the advance in the government’s attitude towards blockchain technology, although the most significant impact will be on the RMB rather than cryptocurrencies.China’s ambition is to bolster the RMB rather than blockchain technology itself.Why did China set blockchain as a national priority? In my opinion, China’s ambition is to bolster the RMB rather than blockchain technology itself. The key driver of setting this national priority is the unsuccessful RMB globalization strategy and the competitive pressure of Libra, which is regarded as a U.S. program by many in China. So the government is seeking a way to make the RMB stronger and more acceptable globally.Do you suppose crypto companies that left in 2017 or earlier will return to China? The regulation of crypto businesses in China after President Xi’s statements actually intensified. There is an old saying in China, “The bandit needs to be wiped out before the regular army gets in.” I think companies that left China won’t return until the regulatory environment becomes clearer. This is hardly possible in the short term. Instead, the government is promoting adoption and application of blockchain technology in industries such as in supply chain management, source tracking in the food industry and so on. It has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. What do you think of the PBoC's digital replacement for cash? How do you envision the rollout happening?PBoC’s effort on creating a digital replacement for cash is the very first step in bringing the RMB to global trade, but its target is not to replace the current digital payment system in China. It will be rolled out under pressure from Libra and other governments’ fiat digital currencies. But I think it will take a pretty long time for real implementation in China.How has the crypto mining industry in China evolved over the past year? It was a dramatic year for miners in China, which can be divided into three periods:In Q1, we experienced a very inactive market. Most miners were very pessimistic, but some institutional players joined and brought new energy. From Q2 to Q3, the mining industry was growing very fast due to the surge in bitcoin’s price. But the good days didn’t last long after the big price drop at the end of Q3 and the crazy growth of the hash rate. Lots of miners who bought mining machine futures that were set to be delivered in Q4 and the first quarter of 2020 experienced major losses. Q4 was a bloody period for the mining industry. Manufacturers began selling at discounted prices. They also worked with crypto financial institutions (like Babel) to try to offload inventories in preparation for the new-generation miners in 2020, when I anticipate that more institutional players will come into the market. Overall, the field has changed a lot and some new pools grew quickly. Miners are quite divided in attitude towards the coming bitcoin reward halving and we need to wait for the halving before we can give a conclusion.Is there any effect on the crypto industry by the ongoing trade war? The China-U.S. trade war was one of the key drivers of BTC surge during May to June 2019, but since September bitcoin is no longer the “safe haven” assets for investors worrying about the trade war after market moving favor to other categories of assets.But when we dive deeper, it is noted that the fundamental conflict of the trade war between China and US is the currency competition. Therefore, I think the ongoing trade war has a long-term impact on the crypto industry by dragging China’s state-owned resources and corporations into this industry. Other thoughts on the industry?I'm still positive about bitcoin in the long term, and wish everyone would HODL. On the other hand, the crypto industry is at its very early stage, there will be lots of developments out of our expectations, just like the internet in 1980s. Let’s give it time and see.This post has been updated with fresh Babel loan numbers.

currency, ...","Jan 16, 2020 at 22:00 UTC","ST. MORITZ — The United States may be entering a second Cold War, according to some investors, who seem mildly curious but otherwise unconcerned about the prospect.","“It’s a kind of Cold War, but not just for crypto,” said Multicoin Capital’s Beijing-based partner Mable Jiang. “Currency is the leverage.”Jiang said China’s goal is to leverage the rise of cryptocurrency, including both domestic bitcoin mining and a state-issued digital currency, to supplant the dollar and become the world’s leading economic power. Such rivalries feel lightyears away in the frosted Swiss alps, which are teeming with high-net-worth individuals soaking up the last few days of politician-free ski slopes before the World Economic Forum in Davos.Roughly 250 people gathered at the Crypto Finance Conference St. Moritz this week, hosted in a luxurious mountain getaway at 6,000 feet, for a series of talks that largely revolve around embracing strict compliance standards. (Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss took a break from skiing to argue that thorough regulatory standards could help the U.S. retain its leading role in the global financial system.)For crypto conference regulars who recall the post-2017 token boom correction, this gathering might feel like falling into a time machine, complete with security token sales and closed-loop stablecoins. Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum (WEF) worked with 38 central banks around the world in 2019 to develop digital payment or asset strategies, according to Sheila Warren, the WEF’s head of blockchain and distributed ledger technology. From Cambodia to Colombia, many emerging nations plan to launch operational stablecoin projects, beyond pilots, in 2020.“There’s this sense that they [emerging economies] could actually benefit from pegging a stablecoin to a basket of currencies in a way that they can’t currently do if they issue paper money,” Warren said.Today, most global commerce relies on dollars in some fashion. Warren said there’s “certainly an interest” among emerging economies in developing systems that don’t pass through New York clearinghouses. That’s where Jiang said the Chinese plans for a digital RMB currency come in.“It’s not actually for people who live in China. They have WeChat or AliPay,” she said. “It’s another global settlement currency, including for developing countries around the world, which they [the Chinese] are friends with.”Warren said the U.S. would likely resist systems that circumnavigate the dollar, adding Chinese government officials are actively participating in talks related to the WEF’s blockchain initiative. ConsenSys, the Ethereum Foundation and the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance are among the companies consulting leaders in those emerging economies, she said. However, Warren added, the WEF doesn’t make those introductions nor recommend any country issue a digital currency. It merely offers guidelines and support to decision makers in emerging economies. Carmen Benitez, CEO of the Switzerland-based startup Fetch Blockchain LTD, heads yet another firm consulting countries eager to issue a cryptocurrency.“They approached us,” Benitez said of her clients in the Colombian president’s office, which is setting up a bank-managed stablecoin for government projects in 2020. “They want a coin … they like the idea of keeping [the economic flow] as closed as possible with the coin.”Cypherpunks might argue a state- or bank-issued currency with strict limitations imposed by the issuer bears little resemblance to “cryptocurrency.” But that doesn’t deter the blockchain fans gathered at St. Moritz. Benitez said using a blockchain-based currency would provide better transparency and automation than Colombia’s current, paperwork-heavy system. Likewise, most attendees appeared more excited about fitting tokens into a traditional banking framework than they were about innovations like the Lightning Network, for example.“Stablecoins and central bank digital currencies will be [widespread] in just a few years,” said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist of Hamburg Commercial Bank. “Even if Libra doesn’t come true, there will be another privately issued stablecoin backed by fiat currencies.”To many of these attendees, bitcoin offers a welcome diversification of investment options. Indeed, Grayscale director Michael Sonnenshein said the firm garnered more assets in 2019 than all previous years combined, leading to a total of $2.4 billion worth of crypto under management. Bitcoin products are still the most popular, although altcoin dips don’t deter investors. “We saw stronger inflows into our ethereum product last year,” Sonnenshein said. “Investors are looking at more than just bitcoin.” Generally speaking, self-custody isn’t a priority for such institutional, European clients. This bothers Pascal Gauthier, CEO of hardware wallet company Ledger, who said there’s scant focus on secure custody as Europe is regulating bitcoin-related activities “very heavily, very quickly.”European regulations like AMLD5 require all companies involved with money transmission, potentially including lightning liquidity providers, decentralized finance (DeFi) products like Compound and custodial wallets, behave more like banks in 2020 by collecting know-your-customer (KYC) information. This even applies to small startups working with microtransactions. Plus, the Financial Action Task Force established new rules that may force exchanges to collect more information related to addresses that users send crypto to in 2020.Although no one knows for sure how these rules will play out, as they appear difficult to enforce, veteran bitcoiner Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of the Shyft Network, said he worries this approach may be regulating away censorship-resistance.“Lightning applications may be accepting micropayments but acting as hubs, so if you think about being a payment channel provider, you’re effectively involved as an intermediary,” he said. “At the end of the day, this is all about sanctions.”WEF’s Warren agreed dominant economic players, like the U.S., are now tightening the reins on activities with the potential to circumnavigate sanctions.Some digital fiat advocates believe blockchain technology could even make sanctions more effective. Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, who recently became co-founder of the Digital Dollar Foundation to advocate for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) from the U.S., said the term Cold War was a wee bit “strong” for disparity between the U.S. and China. Yet he generally agreed the economic rivalry was reminiscent of “the race to land on the moon.”“Many other global powers are looking to assert their own currency as an important reserve currency,” Giancarlo said. “A digital dollar allows for a more scalpel-like approach to sanctions.”   On the other hand, de la Rubia said it would take a long time for any digital currency to rival the U.S. dollar’s global dominance. He argued that the European Union (EU) would love for Saudi Arabia to price oil contracts in Euros, yet the EU has been unable to contradict the dollar’s supreme liquidity.“Bitcoin will always be volatile, with supply well-defined and demand moving,” he said. “As long as China has international capital controls, it will be hard for the yuan to take over, even as a digital currency.” When asked about bitcoin, Giancarlo preferred to compare Facebook’s Libra project to his own Digital Dollar aspirations and the yuan. “Only one of those three [currency issuers] would be constitutionally prohibited from mining that data for any purpose other than illicit use,” he said. “A digital Yuan will absolutely be monitored by the government for many purposes … a commercial venture absolutely will mine that data to say whether you are shopping at Nordstrom or at Target.”Giancarlo said he wants to dedicate the rest of his career to modernizing America’s financial infrastructure, and he sees a blockchain-based fiat currency as a part of that. He would not say what role bitcoin might play in that future. Instead, he said there’s an increasing interest in exploring “legitimate and positive use cases.”Currency is, after all, a tool for political leverage. And although “blockchain” is on the tips of everyone’s tongue this time of year in Switzerland, few people at St. Moritz acknowledge the role a decentralized cryptocurrency might play beyond an investing hedge.Those who are bullish on bitcoin, not just blockchain, are left wondering how bitcoin can be a geopolitical hedge if most conduits for moving money around the ecosystem are essentially banks.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""We remain loyal to mining activities that form part of open decentralized networks. Mining does not require regulatory activity from governmental oversight bodies or other third-party regulations, this activity is regulated by the protocol itself and network members,"" the manifesto states.The ministry will also ""contribute to the development and market introduction"" of distributed ledgers, support ""any innovation using these digital technologies, even if they are partially unregulated and/or not defined by national law"" and create regulatory sandboxes for the blockchain industry. The government will further seek to adopt the world's best practices when it comes to taxing cryptocurrency-related income. A draft bill on taxation was submitted to the country’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, in November. In addition, the manifesto says, Ukraine aims to  facilitate the interaction between the traditional finance and crypto markets and prevent misconduct by service providers and law enforcement agencies.With pressure from external agencies, however, the head of the Ministry of Finance, Oksana Makarova, said late in January the nation's financial watchdog intends to track crypto transactions exceeding $1,200 USD. The move was to align Ukraine's anti-money laundering practices with the latest Financial Action Task Force recommendations around cryptocurrency transactions, Makarova said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It also happens to be the spot where IOHK, the creators of the Cardano cryptocurrency, helped establish a Blockchain Technology Laboratory. The topic of the meetup, “Bitcoin, Wealth and Wisdom,” afforded a forensic examination of the largest cryptocurrency’s rollercoaster cycle of price bubbles and corrections with plenty of examples of the emotional trauma that accompanied the ride.But what appeared, prima facie, to be nothing more than a roomful of rabid maximalists, on closer inspection turned out to be a bunch of canny investors. “It’s not so much that bitcoin is great, it’s that fiat is so bad,” said an asset manager who asked to be identified only as David. “Going back to the gold standard would be the only thing that would really hurt bitcoin.”A recurring theme among veterans and newbies alike was buying in after the 2017 price bubble, when bitcoin dropped back down to around $3,500 during the 2018 doldrums.Kind of fitting to encounter prudent financial behavior, this being Scotland. And of course, not forgetting that Thomas Bayes, the logician and theologian who studied at Edinburgh in 1719, is generally associated with advanced theories around machine learning and probability.CoinDesk spoke with a number of investors at the meetup to hear what drew them to bitcoin in the first place.I read the bitcoin white paper and was like, ‘Yeah, this is massive.’ Not long after that, all this hype was starting because of the big price increase. I have to say, the price increase made me hesitant. I’ve been through the dot-com boom, and it was kind of reminiscent of that.I didn’t buy on the up-shoot. I waited a while for the top to pop. After it dropped down to about $3,000, I was worried the miners might have taken too big a loss and that would have fundamental consequences. So I waited a bit longer. Then I started to buy at about $5,000. I tend not to disclose how much bitcoin I own but I can say it’s about 5 percent of my disposable worth. I might increase that.I first heard about bitcoin while browsing Tom’s Hardware and I saw these questions about what is the best graphics card for mining bitcoin. I got into mining but had no idea these coins would really be worth anything. I don’t count myself as a bitcoin maximalist. I like to stay rational. Yes, I’m a neuroscientist. I graduated from Edinburgh University. I’m pretty interested in bitcoin. This is not my first meetup. I would say I’m interested in the way people react to bitcoin’s price going up and down, for instance. Like what’s going on inside their brains. My story is that I wanted to buy a motorbike and I had around £2,000 in savings. My dad told me not to burn through my capital but try and use it to make a profit. ‘I don’t care if you buy stocks,’ he said, ‘or if you set up a lemonade stand, or if you buy Greek tobacco and sell it in the UK.’I started to make a theoretical portfolio of stocks and realized I’d have a Ph.D. before I could buy a motorbike. It was when I was looking for alternatives that I discovered bitcoin. I started buying in about September 2017 when it was around $4,000. I went back to Greece in December and cashed out at $18,000.I ended up restoring my grandfather’s motorbike in Greece and I also bought another one when I got back to the UK. I bought into bitcoin after it reached $20,000 when it went back down to $3,000. I don’t have any bitcoin at the moment. I sold it. I am looking forward to buying some more. I have been playing around trying to develop with smart contracts but have not done any commercial work with that.I bought bitcoin first in early 2013. I think it was around £100 or something like that. I sold it a little bit later. I made some money but I definitely would have made a lot more if I sold it now. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Chopcoin were also reported to be shutting down for the same reason.","Jan 28, 2020 at 04:40 UTC",The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is updating its regulatory framework for digital payments.,"Announced Tuesday, Singapore’s Payment Services Act 2019 (PSA) brings so-called Digital Payment Token (DPT) services – effectively covering all crypto businesses and exchanges based in Singapore – under current anti-money laundering (AML) and counterterrorist-financing (CTF) rules.As such, crypto businesses in Singapore are required to first register and then apply for a license to operate in the jurisdiction. Similar to the Fifth European Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which went into effect Jan. 10, Singapore’s new rules are long awaited: the PSA was passed back in January 2019. In the intervening months, Singapore has further cemented itself a forward-thinking jurisdiction in regulating the cryptocurrency industry.As of Jan. 28, firms will have a month to register with MAS, stating they are based in Singapore and are operating a DPT business. Once firms have registered, there’s a six-month grandfathering period during which they have to apply for a payment institution license. “The Payment Services Act provides a forward-looking and flexible regulatory framework for the payments industry,” MAS Assistant Managing Director Loo Siew Yee said in a statement. “The activity-based and risk-focused regulatory structure allows rules to be applied proportionately and to be robust to changing business models. The PS Act will facilitate growth and innovation while mitigating risk and fostering confidence in our payments landscape.”When it comes to implementing crypto regulations, countries around the world are dancing to the beat of the latest Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, first made in October 2018 and then updated in June 2019. This means preparing for a future when payment data relating to the originator and beneficiary of a crypto transaction travels with the payment, guidance known as FATF’s “travel rule.”“The interesting thing about the Monetary Authority of Singapore is that, in a sense, it’s FATF-ready,” said Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at trade group Global Digital Finance. “They were first out the door with a consultation back in July saying this is what we are proposing in terms of the implementation of the PSA, as it relates to sending origination and beneficiary information.”MAS also launched a consultation just before Christmas, adding some amendments to the PSA regarding digital assets. Further aligning Singapore with the FATF, the amendments widen rules to include the transfer of DPTs (as well as them being exchanged); the provision of custodial wallets for or on behalf of customers; and the brokering of DPT transactions.“They [MAS] have gone a bit further than FATF in terms of some criteria, but at the same time some of the other aspects of it are probably not as far as FATF has intended,” said Wright, who is also chief compliance officer at Diginex, a Hong Kong-based firm offering institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets.There are always fears regulation could stifle innovation in such a nascent space as crypto. Indeed, the advent of AMLD5 across Europe may bring increased M&A activity as firms consolidate to meet the increased costs of regulation. U.K.-based Bottle Pay, a cryptocurrency payments provider, said it was closing down in December 2019, citing forthcoming EU money laundering rules; crypto mining pool Simplecoin and bitcoin gaming platform Chopcoin were also reported to be shutting down for the same reason.Meanwhile, Deribit, a Netherlands-based crypto derivatives exchange, said it’s planning to relocate to Panama because its home country's version of AMLD5 “would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise.”David Carlisle, head of community at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, offered a different take. He said the AMLD5 regulations imposed on crypto firms are “bread-and-butter requirements,” including know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and the monitoring of suspicious transactions. Firms will need an appointed person to carry out these tasks, he said, such as a money-laundering reporting officer.“We have certainly not heard any rumblings or intention by businesses to move their operations,” said Carlisle. “Singapore and Switzerland are two countries that show you can strike a balance between having meaningful regulation in place and not being prevented from attracting businesses.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As businesses and individuals make more cross-border payments round the clock, Lagarde said the bank would continue looking into ""the feasibility and merits of a CBDC."" Lagarde, who previously said the ECB should be ""ahead of the curve"" when it comes to CBDCs, added the bank does not want to stand in the way of cryptocurrencies created outside its sphere. ""[T]he prospect of central bank initiatives should neither discourage nor crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area,"" she said. CBDCs may have significant implications for the bloc's financial sector and changes in monetary policy going forward, Lagarde said. The ECB formed a cryptocurrency task force last month that would work closely with eurozone central banks to understand the benefits and costs of a possible eurozone CBDC.Global interest in CBDCs came soon after the unveiling of Facebook's Libra in the summer. Although the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has been working on its  ""digital yuan"" for years, officials only started divulging information on it late last summer, reportedly concerned private initiatives could take market share before the government currency launched. In addition, CBDCs may provide citizens with a means of exchange in the event ""physical cash eventually declines,"" possibly in tandem with private crypto initiatives. Most central bankers have described the relationship between cryptocurrencies, CBDCs and fiat currencies as exclusive and adversarial. Outgoing Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said last year a multi-fiat-backed CBDC could well replace the U.S. dollar as the dominant global reserve currency. IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath argued cryptocurrencies, including CBDCs, lacked key infrastructure and global acceptance to successfully tackle the greenback. Although Lagarde has said cryptocurrencies could address many of the problems with the legacy financial system, she said they might also present new risks to users. Last month, she expressed concern Facebook could use its digital platform to lock out rival stablecoin operators and thereby gain an unfair advantage.

ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, according to ...","Feb 5, 2020 at 09:00 UTC","XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, will have another lackluster year in 2020, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told a roomful of financial advisers.","What's more, he blamed Ripple – one of his firm's largest investments – for what he sees as XRP's underwhelming prospects.The fund manager, whose firm trades and invests in digital assets and startups, chatted onstage with personal finance superstar Ric Edelman at TD Ameritrade’s National LINC 2020 conference in Orlando, Florida last week. At the end of the discussion, Novogratz fielded questions from the audience of Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). The very last one was about his opinion on XRP, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple’s ecosystem. Although recording the event was forbidden, CoinDesk obtained a recording from an attendee. ""Ripple the company owns 60 billion of the coins, of
the XRP,” Novogratz began. “That’s a lot of it.”The total amount of XRP in circulation is 100 billion tokens. While Ripple was “gifted” 80 billion, its holdings are down to 56 billion, of which 48.9 billion are in escrow and the company cannot touch, according to Breanne Madigan, Ripple's vice president of global institutional markets. Nevertheless, Novogratz likened XRP to a situation where a company continuously sells its shares. “When I’m buying a stock, if I know [someone’s] selling $10 billion-worth of it at some price, it makes me less excited to buy the stock,” he said.What makes this remark so biting is that Ripple is Galaxy Digital's largest single holding in another company. Novogratz's firm has put in $23.8 million into Ripple and valued the stake at $27.6 million as of September 30, 2019, according to public filings. The analogy of XRP to shares is a particularly sensitive issue for Ripple. Over the past couple of years, Ripple has been fighting a class-action lawsuit claiming XRP is an unregistered security. The case remains ongoing at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.""XRP is a digital asset,"" Madigan fired back in an email to CoinDesk. ""It is not a stock as it does not give you any stake in Ripple or any other company. Second, XRP has legitimate utility for payments. Companies like MoneyGram, Bitso and others are using XRP in production through RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL).""The company also dramatically reduced its programmatic quarterly token sales this past year, dropping from $251 million worth in Q2 down to none in Q4. ""These statements make clear that Mike doesn’t understand how Ripple manages its stake in XRP and didn’t take time to read what we make publicly available every quarter,"" said Madigan. ""The increase of circulating supply from Ripple distributions of XRP is actually lower than the increase in circulating supply of BTC, BCH, ETH, etc. ""When asked by CoinDesk to elaborate on his comments, Novogratz, through a spokesperson, added, ""On the buying side of that you do have a strong following of XRP in Asia, and an 'XRP Army' which pushes it hard.""In 2019, XRP lost 46.3 percent of its value, according to data compiled by CoinDesk. At the Orlando conference, Novogratz suggested that the trend may continue. “It did underperform immensely last year,” he told the audience. “I think it will underperform immensely again this year and it’s just because of the supply.”Through his spokesperson, Novogratz disputed having said ""immensely,"" but it is clearly audible on the tape.At the Orlando conference, Novogratz contrasted what he characterized as XRP's more centralized setup with that of bitcoin. “[XRP] didn’t get distributed like bitcoin did with mining,"" he said. “You’ve got this one giant pool that are constant sellers.""However, Ripple maintains its network is more decentralized than bitcoin or ethereum, the top two cryptocurrencies by market cap, according to data from Messari.""There are over 150 known validators on XRPL [XRP's distributed ledger] that require 80% consensus to confirm transactions,"" said Madigan. ""Ripple controls 7 out of those 150+ validators, making XRP more decentralized than BTC or ETH which are controlled by Chinese mining groups.""So far, XRP has shown impressive returns in 2020. Prices gained nearly 27 percent since Jan. 1 compared to, say, the S&P 500, which was about flat year-to-date. However, if one were to quibble, XRP did indeed underperform bitcoin’s 29 percent rally.""One of the biggest problems the entire crypto industry continues to face is misinformation,"" Madigan added, in reference to Novogatz. ""There are so many that are willingly – and knowingly – feeding rumors to drive market activity. It is unfortunate that, despite our culture of transparency, influential market participants are ignoring the facts. This holds back the entire crypto industry.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The committee said the government could follow the lead of U.S. regulators and sanction products such as futures contracts tied to bitcoin. Institutions would also be allowed to offer other cryptocurrency services such as trading. ""The Korean government has to gradually allow institutional investors to deal in crypto assets and promote over-the-counter (OTC) desks dedicated to institutional investors’ trade,"" the committee said in the report. To support such a move, the nation's fintech sector should develop custody solutions for cryptocurrency to avoid a reliance on foreign custodians, said the PCFIR. Addressing crypto exchanges, the committee said the government should look into bringing in a licensing scheme or guidance. The industry is currently loosely controlled via guidance given to banks and a South Korean financial watchdog under the Financial Services Commission is also reportedly aiming to directly supervise exchanges. Other suggestions from the PCFIR included, notably, that bitcoin might be directly listed on Korea Exchange, the nation's securities bourse, and that the terms ""cryptocurrency"" and ""virtual currency"" could be brought together under the umbrella term crypto assets.The PCFIR was set up in 2017 to advise on policies relating to new technologies and help lay the groundwork for related new industries and services.

bitcoin, it could be classified as the sale of debt or of an investment ...","Jan 17, 2020 at 19:18 UTC",Canada's top financial watchdog has told crypto exchanges they will be subject to securities law if they act as custodians to users' digital assets.,"The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) said in guidance published Thursday the common exchange practice of custodying users' assets – ""merely providing users with a contractural right or claim to an underlying crypto asset"" – could subject them to securities legislation. ""Whether a crypto asset has been immediately delivered to a Platform’s user is an important component in evaluating whether, and the extent to which, the transaction and the Platform are subject to securities legislation,"" according to the joint statement. The CSA is a group of the provincial securities regulators in Canada, which does not have a federal equivalent like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The CSA said transactions without immediate delivery constitute derivatives sales. Even if the custodied asset is generally recognized as a commodity, such as bitcoin, it could be classified as the sale of debt or of an investment contract, a transaction that comes under the country's securities law. Exchanges that facilitate ""immediate delivery"" will be exempt, according to the CSA. It's unclear what timeframe the group has in mind for a transaction to qualify under this exemption, said Pamela Draper, president and CEO of Canadian crypto exchange Bitvo. The new regulatory requirements may have a significant impact on the exchange landscape. Exchanges that can't or don't comply could be pushed out of Canada, Draper said, leaving the field open to a handful of exchanges that are both willing and able to fit within a more comprehensive regulatory framework. The guidance, which applies to exchanges based in Canada, or with Canadian users, is consistent with a consultation paper the CSA and the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada published in March 2019, said Evan Thomas, a litigator with Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.“Although it will depend on the specifics of each platform’s structure and operations, it seems likely that regulators will consider many custodial trading platforms to be subject to securities legislation,” Thomas added. Canada has been rocked by two exchange scandals in the past year.  Users of the Quadriga exchange were unable to recover more than $190 million worth of funds when founder Gerald Cotten died mysteriously in December 2018. Cotten had siphoned users' holdings to fund his own personal lifestyle, according to an Ernst & Young report.In November, the British Columbia Securities Commission was forced to seize the Einstein exchange after users complained they couldn't access their funds. Amounting to somewhere between US$8 million and $10 million, accountancy firm Grant Thorton said the exchange's wallet had been almost entirely drained. “It looks like [the CSA is] trying to capture every platform and I think they're trying to do that for consumer protection, to prevent another"" Quadriga or Einstein, Draper said.Compelling users to custody their own assets could protect them from hacks like Quadriga or Einstein. But there are downsides. It could make trading less accessible to everyday users by forcing everyone to set up their own wallet, said Draper. “The concern I would have is, not everyone, [not] every consumer transacting in the crypto space has their own wallet or is comfortable with their own wallet,"" she said.But it could also signify that regulators lack confidence in the industry. ""I am sympathetic to the regulators,"" tweeted Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures. ""They saw a wipeout of ~$200 [million] worth of retail deposits. Exchanges have a terrible history of mismanagement.

""Decentralized smart contracts can't hold people accountable for debt. 
For ...","Feb 7, 2020 at 21:20 UTC","It was only December when the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) market was worth less than $700 million. Early this morning, it hit $1 billion, a figure that even the most fervent blockchain skeptics would have a tough time dismissing as meaningless.","That figure is the measure of all the crypto held in projects that lend, hedge, abstract, swap or otherwise make structured bets using ethereum's smart-contract powers, as totaled by DeFi Pulse, which first showed the collective market at $1 billion at 8:00 UTC Friday.To be clear, $1 billion is not how much money people are making on DeFi, but how much they have committed. Their “locked-in” collateral is used on various protocols to make a wide array of bets, from simple loans to complex derivatives.At press time, the figure had dropped back to $993.3 million, but the billion-dollar milestone has been broken nevertheless, and most people in the space believe it's a sign of greater things to come.""It proves that people around the world want access to more efficient, less biased, money,"" Rune Christensen, the creator of DeFi leader MakerDAO, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson.MakerDAO has consistently held the top spot on DeFi Pulse, as the protocol with the most ETH as collateral – some 60 percent of the market. “$1 Billion marks an important milestone for DeFi to be celebrated,” DeFi Pulse wrote on its blog. “Additionally, $1B feels like an early birthday present for DeFi Pulse which was launched in February 2019.” The website has become something of a standard in this nascent industry.DeFi Pulse was not alone in its bullish tone. Investor Spencer Noon of DTC Capital struck a similar note in an email to CoinDesk:""No other smart contract platform comes close in terms of its developer mindshare, tooling, and infrastructure, to the point where I don’t believe DeFi could exist anywhere else today. And perhaps most surprisingly, we’re finally seeing a credible case for ETH to accrue a long-term monetary premium as the only truly trustless collateral type in decentralized finance.""Each hour, DeFi Pulse totals all the ETH and ERC-20 tokens locked inside public DeFi protocols and logs the ""total value locked"" (TVL) on a graph at the top of the page.Of course, that number is mostly ETH, which currently represents 70 percent of the value. As such, the number can be a little misleading because denominating it in dollars exposes the figure to crypto's volatility. In other words, a hard spike in ETH prices (the asset is up 21 percent over the last week) would drive TVL up even if no one else put any more coins in. In fact, when weighed in terms of locked-up ETH, the chart line is going down, not up, over the last seven days. ""Of course some of the DeFi milestone is due to ETH appreciation, but, regardless, we have crossed the inflection point between the bear markets of 2018 and 2019 and are poised for a bull market in 2020,"" CoinFund's Jake Brukhman said in an email. Ryan Sean Adams, a crypto investor and ETH booster on Twitter, tweeted the news, writing: ""Software eating money. Software eating banks. The next decade will be wild.""But nothing big happens on ethereum without bitcoin diehards mocking it. In this case, former bitcoin developer Peter Todd weighed in, tweeting, ""Decentralized smart contracts can't hold people accountable for debt. For that you need guns."" Either way, a billion dollars is still tiny. Just take commercial lending in the U.S. alone. That's an $800 billion market, according to data firm IBISWorld. DeFi has a long way to go.And rapid growth doesn't always continue. For comparison, Kickstarter, the leading crowdfunding site, launched in 2009. It hit $1 billion in pledges in 2014. Six years later, it still hasn't quite touched $5 billion.  Still, DeFi got there a lot quicker, and it's much more complex than crowdfunding. ""This historic milestone is a large part due to numerous factors that have coalesced,"" Felix Feng of Set Protocol, which automates investing, told CoinDesk in an email. He sees improvements in things like composability and smart-contract security bringing more users in.Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, another leading DeFi protocol, said the milestone showed that users were finding ways to use crypto more trustlessly, with less reliance on exchanges.""Satoshi would be extremely proud,” he told CoinDesk.

The billboard was put up Friday for 24 hours.“We find it amusing that the same sentence, taking back control, can mean two different things,” Gauthier said in a phone call. “It’s a great moment to frame one of bitcoin’s taglines as an effective way to take back control over your money, digital secrets, and private key.”The billboard is meant to challenge the nativism behind Brexit’s success. “Brexit means taking back control over borders and currency. It’s very U.K.-centric. Bitcoin is the opposite. It's a borderless, global technology,” Gauthier said. The executive is waiting to see how Brexit’s trade deals will affect his company going forward. Ledger opened a U.K. operation last quarter and employs several people in London, though does not have “a physical office at this time.” Crypto exchange Bitpanda took a harder line on the U.K.’s departure. “Personally, I think Brexit is a mistake,” said Eric Demuth, the Vienna-based co-CEO and founder. “I feel like many people do not see the great impact and were misled by the personal short-term goals of some politicians. No self-promoting politician should be a reason for anyone to be stripped of their freedoms.”Making light of this alleged political grift, Bitpanda shelled out for a multi-day advertising campaign reminding viewers that “millions of people can’t be wrong.” “Unless they’re British.”The admonishment will hang at “The Screen” in Canary Wharf and three other London locations, on 38 installations throughout Glasgow, Scotland and throughout the Belgium capital of Brussels. “We want to provoke people to think about the impact their vote has on their lives,” Demuth said. Peter McCormack, a prominent crypto commenter based in England, called the sign “hypocritical” and said “real bitcoiners would probably support Brexit.” For his part, McCormack said he supports the divorce in theory, though he recognizes the alliance forged in 1973 has helped keep the peace in Europe. “I don’t feel anything, it’s a total anticlimax. I don’t want to celebrate leaving,” McCormack said on a call.Ivis Buric, a Bitpanda representative, said the company received a “copy denial from media owners in London,” who rejected the political nature of the advertisement. “Thankfully, there is still freedom of speech and advertising rules so we are live on location,” Buric said. Bitpanda’s media campaign began Thursday night, and Buric said the company is happy with the response from the community. She also claimed there’s been a 12.68 percent bump in users from Europe.Charlie Shrem, an American entrepreneur and crypto luminary, said the “guerrilla marketing is amazing.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

moving billions of dollars in value on a public ledger that anyone can ...","Feb 10, 2020 at 18:00 UTC","It started with a $9,000 data software contract for the FBI in 2015.","But just five years later, Chainalysis is now the cryptocurrency-tracing equivalent of Palantir, the data analytics company flush with lucrative government software contracts. Chainalysis is, right now, doing millions of dollars worth of business each year with the U.S. government, dwarfing its competitors in the young industry of blockchain surveillance.The company is by far Uncle Sam’s leading crypto analysis contractor by spending and has become the go-to firm for 10 federal agencies, departments and bureaus.In short, the feds want to catch up on, and make sense of, the tangled transactional web of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to stop all sorts of crimes – and they’ll spend big to do it.Federal agencies have spent at least $10 million ($10,690,706 to be precise) in American tax dollars on Chainalysis’ tools, services and training since 2015, when Chainalysis was founded, according to 82 records of federal procurement contracts reviewed by CoinDesk. Counting contracts with possible extensions, the company stands to take in more than $14 million. No competing firm’s federal contracts match Chainalysis', and none are as prevalent across agencies. CipherTrace, led by CEO David Jevans, has made about $6 million through mostly research and development contracts; Elliptic, a British firm, has had only one contract worth $2,450 with the Internal Revenue Service, according to federal data. Chainalysis’ contracts open a small but prescient window into the federal government’s nascent relationship with the cryptocurrencies some use to evade detection. Bitcoin is a pseudonymous system with inherent traceability – a network moving billions of dollars in value on a public ledger that anyone can track.And though Chainalysis data show only 1.1 percent of bitcoin transactions were illicit in 2019, that proportion is growing: up 180 percent over the year before. The U.S. government has responded in kind, raising its spending on Chainalysis every year, the data show. It paid the company over $5 million in 2019, a 20 percent increase from 2018 and a 22,558 percent increase from 2015, when the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service were Chainalysis’ only federal clients.Nowadays, Chainalysis’ federal money comes from many corners: the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), from financial regulators in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), from the IRS, the Secret Service (USSS), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) – even from the Department of the Air Force.Most have signed six-figure deals with Chainalysis, although some agencies spend more than others. For instance, the TSA spent $40,000 on one contract in 2018 while the IRS, Chainalysis’s biggest federal partner spent $4.1 million over five years – $3.6 million of it since 2018, according to the data.ICE, with $2.6 million in total contracts, holds the number two spot, and the FBI’s $2.4 million is third. But the FBI plans to spend millions more in the next two years, and will overtake the IRS as the U.S. government's most prolific Chainalysis partner. On Dec. 18, 2019, it paid Chainalysis $377,500 for ""Virtual Currency Tracing Tools,"" with an option to spend at least $3,628,775 through 2022.By contrast, when Vice reported on Chainalysis’s government contracts in 2017, the fledgling New York firm had received $330,000 from the FBI, $88,000 from the IRS and $58,000 from ICE in its history.It’s tricky to state with certainty what the agencies are buying from Chainalysis. Many of the contracts are short on details, with 29 mentioning various product licenses, five noting “Reactor” software and others a cryptic mix of telling and vague. (The Department of the Air Force has spent over $110,000 on “BitCoin [sic] Cryptocurrency Transactions”).But the company that raised $30 million in Series B funding a year ago makes only three products: Reactor, KYT and Kryptos. Only Reactor, its flagship transaction visualization software, has been around for more than a year.“While our private-sector customers also use Reactor, we have also developed two newer products – KYT (Know Your Transaction) and Kryptos – specifically for them,” said Jonathan Levin, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Chainalysis.Reactor is Chainalysis’ investigatory workhorse. It visualizes cryptocurrency movement across a blockchain and flags addresses associated with illicit activity. Casey Bohn, a high-tech crime specialist with the Virginia-based National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C), who regularly trains law enforcement officers to use Reactor and other firms’ cryptocurrency tools, said Reactor takes some of the pain out of blockchain crawling. “It’s a relatively easy tool to use. It's not a rocket surgeon level of complexity,” Bohn said. “Once you figure the tool out you can really make some good headway in what is truly a tedious task.” Bohn has taught federal, state and local officers, including some in the 10 agencies that contract with Chainalysis. He explained that blockchain analysis has broad appeal for them.“All of these investigative agencies kind of have a specialized sub-niche” that intersects with cryptocurrency, he said. One such niche is the IRS Cyber Crimes Unit (CCU), a five-year-old division of its larger Criminal Investigation (CI) wing and the force behind the tax collector’s cryptocurrency crimes investigations. It’s also a major Chainalysis client: CCU has spent over $3.3 million on four years of “Case Support and Training” from the firm. The IRS did not respond to requests for comment. But in the 2019 Criminal Investigations annual report, IRS-CI Deputy Chief Jim Lee hinted his agents’ crypto-tracing prowess is “in demand” even outside of the agency.“U.S. Attorneys want IRS-CI agents in all of their financial crime cases. The fact of the matter is, if a case involves money and it’s a crime that rises to the federal level, IRS-CI almost always has jurisdiction. There is no better example to this than in tracing cryptocurrency transactions,” he said.IRS-CI Chief Don Fort has been even more explicit about his investigators’ relationship. He has said that Chainalysis helped the IRS and the Department of Justice dismantle a sprawling child pornography ring in South Korea.But other agencies don’t talk about their cryptocurrency tracing activities. Most did not respond to requests for comment. FinCEN, the FBI and DEA declined to comment. “DEA does not discuss any investigative techniques,” a spokesperson said.Agencies may also not want to publicize their private-sector relationships, other now-public documents show.In 2018, Vice filed a FOIA request with ICE demanding the agency produce documents related to its $13,188 contract for Chainalysis “software.” Five months later, ICE released an at-times poorly redacted document that confirmed its Homeland Security Investigations unit uses Reactor.“Public disclosure of Chainalysis, Inc.'s cooperation with ICE would also damage ongoing cooperative information sharing arrangements with other companies in the logistics and financial sector,” according to that document.Chainalysis tailored its earliest product to cryptocurrency investigators. Levin, the co-founder, said his company initially focused on signing specialized agency teams.“We started off with smaller units within agencies who were focused on being able to deal with cybercrime and money laundering,” Levin said. “What we found is that the different types of crime and illicit activity that these agencies need to be able to prevent means that our appeal has become much broader to those organizations, and our role has expanded.”The strategy triggered a snowball effect of federal procurement contracts that may well stretch beyond the figures disclosed here. Levin said some contacts do not get reported in the FPDS system. “Our revenue is roughly a 50-50 split between public and private sectors,” Levin said. The public split includes contracts with state-level agencies and governments overseas.In many respects $10.6 million is a negligible total, according to Bohn, the cyber crimes educator. He pointed out the U.S. government spends many times more on other private-sector tech solutions, like Cellebrite, which helps investigators crack mobile phone data. Cellebrite has made at least $40,000,000 from government contracts since August 2015, FPDS records show.But when it comes to tracing cryptocurrency, Chainalysis appears to have the federal market cornered.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Chainalysis found that while the amount of bitcoin sent from criminal entities doubled between 2018 and the end of 2019, it still accounts for just 0.08 percent of the total number of bitcoin transactions last year. And while exchange hacks and thefts dominated headlines last year, “scams were by far the highest-earning category of crypto crime in 2019,” the report said. “Cryptocurrency scams represent a significant danger to consumer protection, and the growth of this activity in 2019 calls for increased action from regulators, law enforcement and exchanges alike.”According to the report, scammers received roughly $4.3 billion in crypto, out of about $6 billion received from illicit activity last year. Overall, scams accounted for $8.6 billion in crypto transactions, while criminal activity (including hacks and thefts) totaled just under $12.5 billion.. Other categories included terrorism financing, ransomware, darknet markets, outright theft, sanctions and child abuse. Moreover, the total amount of crypto used in scams is disproportionately weighed down by “just three separate large-scale Ponzi schemes”; without them, the numbers drop dramatically (for example, the PlusToken Ponzi appears to have accounted for between $2 and $3 million alone).Chainalysis mentions at multiple points that a solution, or at least the beginnings of one, to the issue of illicit activity can come from more informed regulation, better enforcement of regulation and action by crypto exchanges to tackle illicit activities. “We believe the consumer protection implications make cryptocurrency scams an issue regulators must address and law enforcement must have the resources to investigate,” the report said. “Exchanges are also in a unique position to help, both in terms of protecting users from being scammed and preventing successful scammers from depositing funds or cashing out.”Regulators and law enforcement agents must become more familiar with analyzing blockchains as part of this effort, the report said.The company also highlights its own services, noting that while money laundering in the fiat world might require court-issued subpoenas to tackle, “blockchain analysis tools like Chainalysis” can help investigators analyze transactions recorded on public ledgers.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The technical possibility of USDT’s Liquid debut was first announced in July 2019.Innocuous at first glance, the transfer has implications for both digital asset trading and the larger tether market, which saw a mass migration from Omni, a bitcoin-based protocol, to ethereum and even Tron over the course of 2019.But what Liquid offers is privacy.Through confidential assets – a privacy tool which blinds asset values on public ledgers via a protocol called “confidential transactions” – these tether may never see public light again. In fact, it may be the first instance of private digital asset trading at scale.By hiding tether transfers between off-exchange accounts on Liquid and exchanges themselves, traders can move assets around “without worrying about frontrunning,” pseudonymous Blockstream community manager Grubles told CoinDesk via Telegram. For example, a trader could move some Liquid-based tether to an exchange, with the intent of buying bitcoin without tipping her hand to others who might drive the price up before she can make the purchase. “Movements of tether can be tracked in general but also particularly to and from exchanges, which is valuable information. People absolutely trade based on this information,” Grubles said. “Moving from a blockchain that has transparent transactions and onto Liquid is somewhat of a no-brainer in the context of trading.”Tether maintains a healthy competitive advantage against other stablecoins with nearly 75 times the daily trading volume of the next leading stablecoin, the Paxos Standard (PAX), according to Messari’s Stablecoin Index. Noting its ubiquitous use today by traders, Grubles said a pairing with privacy tech only adds to tether’s competitive edge.Moreover, tether on Liquid may be the first instance of a semi-private stablecoin, according to Blockstream CSO Samson Mow.“Services like Whale Alert, that track movements of assets, would not work for confidential assets in Liquid,” Mow told CoinDesk.However, the number of tether tokens issued on Liquid remains public via the Blockstream block explorer, said Grubles, potentially assuaging some of the concerns of Tether skeptics. The stablecoin issuer and its sister company, Bitfinex, are currently under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office for allegedly commingling corporate and customer funds.Confidential assets (CAs) were first formally proposed by Blocksteam employees in an April 2017 academic paper penned by bitcoin researchers Andrew Poelstra, Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille.As described in the paper, the researchers used Pedersen commitments, a mathematical function capable of shielding input information while proving its overall validity, to “blind the amounts of all unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs, the term for individual blockchain values).”Through CAs, coins can be both hidden from prying eyes and proven to still exist. Customer demand drove the decision to convert $15 million worth of tether from ethereum to the Liquid version, Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino told CoinDesk.“With Confidential Transactions you can’t see the amounts being sent from one party to another,” said Mow. “That means that USDT issued in the Liquid Network provides better privacy than USDT on other chains.”As a vehicle for crypto trading and price volatility protection, it’s likely more USDT will be minted on Liquid given the advantages. And, it's not like Tether hasn’t played nomad before.“We may be witnessing the beginning of another Tether migration from ERC20 to Liquid,” said Tales from the Crypt podcast host Marty Bent in a blog post Tuesday. (ERC20 is the standard Tether has used to create tokens on top of ethereum.)Launched as RealCoin in July 2014, tether is currently issued on multiple blockchains, the largest of which are ethereum, Omni and Tron. As data provider CoinMetrics shows, Tether kicked issuance onto the ethereum blockchain into high gear in April 2019, rising from $60 million to $400 million in a mere four weeks.Eight months later and a flippening of sorts occurred, with tether issuance on ethereum overtaking Omni earlier this winter. At press time, some $2.3 billion tether was issued on ethereum compared to $1.5 billion on Omni.While $15 million may be a far cry from $60 million, let alone $1.5 billion or $2.3 billion, Tether’s last year with ethereum demonstrates how fast the tide can shift.“The impetus for the transition away from Omni to an ERC20 standard is, from what I understand, because their wallet support is [subpar]. What ethereum has done really well to date is make it really easy for services to spin up a wallet and accept random tokens,” Bent wrote. “One thing the transition to an ERC20 standard hasn't solved for Tether users is the Whale Alert problem.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Payments are made across a network of such accounts and only the setting up and closing of the accounts is registered on the blockchain.This can result in payments that are far faster and more scalable than those made directly on the blockchain, and is touted as a way to make crypto payments more feasible in bricks-and-mortar stores. Bitcoin transactions, for example, currently take on average roughly 11 minutes to be confirmed on the network, though the figure has sometimes peaked at over 15 minutes. Lightning is said to take from milliseconds to seconds, by contrast. According to a CSAIL report on Spider, PCNs can be slowed by inefficient routing schemes, and often quickly run down users’ accounts, meaning they are forced to top up their funds frequently.Spider is claimed to be a more efficient way of routing payments, in which participants can invest just a fraction of funds in their account. It's also said to be able to process around four times the number of transactions, compared with other PCNs, before registering the events on the blockchain.Spider works by splitting transactions into smaller amounts or “packets” that propagate over different channels at varying rates, CSAIL writes. By dividing the amounts into bite-sized chunks, large payments can be routed through accounts that may have low funding levels. Unlike with other systems that will send the full payment and possibly be rejected by accounts with insufficient funds – thus causing delays as the transaction is rerouted – Spider can produce payments that are less likely to clog up the network or fail, its team say.“Routing money in a way that the funds of both users in each joint account are balanced allows us to reuse the same initial funds to support as many transactions as possible,"" Sivaraman said.  The routing system was inspired by packet switching, a method of efficiently transmitting data over the web.Another feature of the tech is it allows payments to be queued at congested accounts rather than being rejected, while the team also built an algorithm they say can help spot congested accounts.In tests looking at how it handles one-directional payments where an account becomes depleted and needs to be topped up on the blockchain, the team says Spider can also outperform other PCN systems.The researchers aim to present a paper on Spider at the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation later this month. “It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently,” said lead author Sivaraman. “This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.”The research team included other members of CSAIL, as well as Radhika Mittal of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Kathleen Ruan and Giulia Fanti of Carnegie Mellon University.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""Cryptocurrencies are still pretty correlated so with some of the developments around Craig Wright and BSV, that ended up moving the entire market,"" Paul Veradittakit, of Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk in an email. Bitcoin SV is the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap. It shot up 117 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk's BSV Price Index.Since ETH gets ""locked in"" to DeFi apps, the total market value will go up any time the value in ETH increases, but that's only part of the picture.DeFi Pulse showed the DeFi market as having roughly $706 million in ETH locked into its applications on Monday. As of this writing, that value has risen to $782 million.Another part of the story is speculators looking to capitalize on a market spike. It has been a very long time since we've seen such a big day in a Top 10 cryptocurrency, Robert Leshner of Compound Finance told CoinDesk. Leshner said that it's very likely that money is moving into DeFi because traders are looking for liquidity in order to play the market.""On a day when prices are moving 100 percent, an annual rate doesn't matter to them,"" Leshner said.Compound, which provides an easy way for ETH holders to borrow, saw a surge in usage Tuesday with collateral rising about 10 percent, according to DeFi Pulse. Similarly, volume on Uniswap, the decentralized token swapping dapp, is up almost 100 percent over the day before, according to Uniswap Info.MakerDAO has also seen a large jump, nearing $50 million, likely because traders are locking up ETH to create DAI they can trade with.""Ether is the primary form of collateral used to do other stuff,"" Leshner noted, so when it's worth more, its holders can do more stuff. However, the first step in that process is to turn to DeFi applications to provide liquidity, for example, by borrowing against an asset whose value is rising. Joel Monegro of Placeholder, a venture firm focused on innovative blockchain technologies, told CoinDesk that now is the early phase of a new technology class. Now is when users are going to test its mettle.“The ~$600 million 'locked' in DeFi protocols is all funny money. It’s not enough for global finance to care. But it’s a huge bounty to break the smart contracts behind it. And if we’re going to break them, better do it at the toy stage,"" Monegro said, comparing it to the era when spending money on the web still felt dicey. ""Commerce moved online slowly, then all at once; finance will move on-chain slowly – then all at once,"" he wrote.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

According to some analysts, the cryptocurrency is plagued by controversy and poor liquidity due to shallow order book depth.Research analyst at eToro, Simon Peters, said that when rumors surfaced that BSV founder Craig Wright received the ""keys"" to 1.1 million bitcoins (BTC) locked up in a fund known as the Tulip Trust, many in the crypto community anticipated Wright could dump a large proportion of his BTC holdings onto the market in favor of BSV.The trust is said to be guarding pieces of the private keys necessary to unlock the bitcoin Wright and his former partner Dave Kleiman mined before 2014. Wright claims this is the $9.5 billion fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s founder.“As it stands, a 300 percent move in a week is generally unsustainable,” Peters said of BSV.Titled “Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision,” BSV has been embroiled in controversy since its early days, with major exchanges including Binance, Kraken and Shapeshift delisting the cryptocurrency , a move that has been contributing to increased volatility, Peters said.“BSV is more vulnerable to major price swings due to a lack of depth of the order books in the smaller exchanges where it can be traded,” Peters said.An order book refers to an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level. When there aren't enough buyers or sellers on the books, illiquidity makes the assets more at risk to be manipulated by larger funds and investors.BSV’s trading volume remains relatively thin compared to the others in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for the past 30 days. However, the standard deviation of returns — in other words, its volatility — has soared relative to the other nine leading cryptos. That signals that single orders in its shallow order books have a large impact on BSV’s price.“Clearly the case,” said Alex Krüger, a prominent crypto trader and analyst, discussing BSV’s swift price rise and steep sell-off, saying that it was related to a lack of liquidity on the major exchanges.But it’s not just the result of delisting the coin on many major exchanges. As Peters suggested, Wright’s recent court issues may have also caused a demonstrable effect on price movement.CoinDesk recently reached out to Wright for comment but he declined to comment on price movement, BSV’s delisting and price volatility.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Anything less would be considered a “failure,” they said.","In an “Ask Me Anything” Reddit discussion held Wednesday, the Eth 2.0 team said the network won’t launch until three clients can run testnets consistently for a minimum of eight weeks. AMA participants included ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Eth 2.0 researchers Danny Ryan and Justin Drake.""I have 95% confidence we will launch in 2020,"" Drake wrote.Eth 2.0, the next iteration of the world’s leading smart-contract blockchain, promises higher transaction throughput and a new security model under Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Often called Serenity, Eth 2.0 has been in the works since ethereum’s launch in 2015 but has been slow to get off the ground due to the highly technical nature of the endeavor. The launch for Eth 2.0 was first slated for January 2020 and then an undisclosed date in Q2 2020. Developers are now eyeing the network’s fifth anniversary, July 30, 2020, for Eth 2.0’s debut.“Phase 0 will certainly launch in 2020. Audits are out and testnets are getting stronger every week,” Ryan said in the discussion thread. “I don't see a reality in which Phase 0 does not launch in 2020.”Ryan and Buterin said they believe Eth 2.0 could deploy Phase 0, the Beacon Chain, which acts as a general manager of Eth 2.0’s PoS system, on only two stable clients. Other Eth 2.0 researchers are opting for a more conservative approach, however.At the time of ethereum’s debut in 2015, the Parity client launched after Geth, leading to the validator set swinging disproportionately toward the latter client, at an 80-20 tilt, Drake said. “Parity never managed to catch up with Geth,” he added.Regardless of the launch date, Phase 0 and Phase 1 are 99 and 90 percent complete, respectively, Ryan said. Phase 1 will link ETH holders who have staked their assets to the Beacon Chain, joining the ribs to the backbone of the new network.Third-party code audits and testnets – such as a lite client capable of being run on an Android smartphone demoed by Ethereum developer Nimbus on Tuesday – remain the outstanding tasks, Eth 2.0 researcher Diederik Loerakker said.The coming months should also feature one major update for ethereum coin holders looking to participate in Eth 2.0’s launch: staking contracts.As a PoS network, asset holders are rewarded for pledging their coin holdings to protect and validate the network. Eth 2.0 will require 32 ETH, currently valued around $6,400, to participate as a validator.Contracts for staking ether (ETH) are under audit with an announcement expected this spring at a major ethereum event, Ryan said. The team said the number of validators could run into the millions with one researcher claiming up to 10 percent of ether’s supply, which has a current market cap of $23 billion, could be staked on Eth 2.0.Finally, the Eth 2.0 team continues to examine how to package the current ethereum network, a Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, into Eth 2.0.Dubbed “Eth 1.5”, two options have been proposed: transitioning Eth 1.x into “stateless clients,” as detailed in a December blog post from Buterin, or merging Eth 1.x into the Eth 2.0’s Beacon Chain “as is.”In short, the current ethereum blockchain can either be trimmed into digital receipts proving the authenticity of old PoW transactions or Eth 1.x can work within Eth 2.0 through interoperability bridges until the new chain is fully built out.As Buterin noted, the former option – digital receipts – seems to be “the way the wind is blowing.” Still, significant challenges remain such as the “technical viability” of stateless clients and the “megabyte-size blocks every 13 seconds that they would entail,” Buterin said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The second phase includes a consumer-focused digital payments app Bakkt first formally announced in October.“The next big hurdle for the company will be getting that app into consumer hands and we will be looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense,"" Sprecher said. ""Fortunately, that company is not a big drain on us … we have a lot of financial flexibility now from the company given it has a revenue stream both from trading and from operation of all these rewards programs.""Users will be able to manage and transact with airline miles, hotel points, cryptocurrencies and other assets on a single platform, he said.

In a press release Wednesday, ICE said Bakkt is looking to close a new funding round in the coming days.During Thursday’s earnings call, ICE CFO Scott Hill said Bakkt was included in a bucket of ICE’s anticipated expenses for the fiscal year, as the company expects to spend $20 to $30 million in technology and operations.

""The dollar’s status is bolstered by the institutions, rule of law and credible investor protection that the U.S. is seen as providing.""The idea that digital currencies could directly challenge the greenback's dominance has been advocated by some leading economic figures. The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, previously suggested a central bank digital currency (CBDC) backed by a basket of reserve currencies – a ""synthetic hegemonic currency"" (SHC) – could benefit national economies as the process of globalization continues.But although SHCs could better rebalance global trade, they would have to be accepted globally, according to Gopinath. With many emerging markets, which are gradually making up more and more of global GDP, switching to the greenback, that is unlikely to happen anytime soon, she said.According to the IMF, the dollar made up more than 60 percent of global foreign exchange reserves in Q3 2019, having increased by more than $100 billion in the past year. The next largest, the euro, comprised only 20 percent of exchange reserves in the same period. In the past year, central banks have begun publicly talking about launching their own digital currencies. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) revealed in the summer it was ""close"" to launching its long-in-development digital yuan as an alternative to private initiatives like Libra, as well as raise the renminbi's status overseas. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell said in November the U.S. central bank was exploring whether a digital dollar would even benefit the U.S. economy.  The new chief of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, also recently said her institution should be “ahead of the curve” when it comes to CBDCs, though it needs to be clear on the objectives of a potential digital euro.The IMF has previously advocated research into digital currencies. When she was its head in 2016, Christine Lagarde said central bankers should ""seriously"" consider issuing CBDCs to encourage financial inclusion and improve the privacy of payments.But the IMF has also advised against premature adoption. In September 2018, it asked officials from the Marshall Islands to reconsider launching a digital currency that would work alongside the U.S. dollar. Unless the country introduced strict anti-money laundering checks, an IMF report said, it could face losing crucial correspondent banking relationships with U.S. banks, losing access to the dollar and effectively cutting the nation out of the global financial system.

Please report it to the relevant social media platform, and to us right away, by emailing fraud@coindesk.com and nik@coindesk.com. If possible, please include screenshots of what was written.If you need to confirm you are, in fact, communicating with a CoinDesk staffer please email news@coindesk.com or check our masthead. Scams and crypto go hand in hand. We hate that this is the case but it is the truth. Now that CoinDesk has been implicated in a number of scams, we’d like to explain what is being done and how.Most of the victims receive a Telegram message like this one:The back and forth between the scammer and the news editor is usually friendly and, in some countries where organizations often pay for news coverage, expected. The opportunity is simple: Send the scammer $500 or so in bitcoin and get onto CoinDesk’s front page.Some of these scammers have gotten sophisticated to the point where they are spoofing CoinDesk email addresses to “verify” their identities (check the headers of these emails!). One con artist even forged a CoinDesk editor’s passport to “confirm” their identity. One of the victims requested $150 in USDC to be sent to this address: 0x586Cb8bd74D6A6d69EC3AF69914eE478Ddfd4eeE.One scammer went so far as to create an invoice for their victim to further lend the offer credibility.CoinDesk is working with our legal counsel and tech team to find ways of thwarting these impostors. In the meantime, please verify the handles of the accounts reaching out to you. CoinDesk’s reporters and editors list their digital accounts on their individual author pages. You should also email the writer or editor directly if you have any questions. More recently, CoinDesk was made aware that our daily newsletter, Blockchain Bites, is being copied to promote questionable cryptocurrency giveaways. For the record, CoinDesk does not promote such giveaways, and certainly not in our newsletters. We understand marketing is hard for a startup. In a world full of good ideas, how do you make your voice heard?Paying for coverage isn’t one of them. In the years we’ve been writing, many “PR people” have approached startups with sure-fire ways to appear on the front pages of multiple big organizations. Some of these people are outright frauds. Some of them will actively reach out to editors on your behalf and tell them you are building something cool and that they should write about you. The chance you will get a post out of that interaction ranges from zero to a few percents, especially if the PR person has a prior relationship with that reporter.What is the best way to reach out to any reporter?Prepare an email that says,“Hey, I’m doing something cool. I’m the CEO of [your company], a company in [place]. It is a [what your project does.] Can I show you how it works?”Include a link and screenshots. Research reporters who might be interested in your topic. Find their emails, Twitter handles, etc. Reach out exactly three times. If they don’t respond, move on. That, in short, is the best strategy for reaching out to any reporter, including ones at CoinDesk.The bottom line?Never pay for coverage. Never expect coverage in return for tokens or cash.

that speculation is the best-proven user narrative for the entire asset ...","Jan 30, 2020 at 19:16 UTC","They're definitely not equity, but could ""exchange tokens"" be bellwethers for one of crypto's best use cases? (Spoiler: Probably not)","Among thousands of venture-backed startups, tokens, coins, blockchains and open-source technology projects, exchange operators now stand out among the top revenue getters in the crypto asset category. Coinbase, not the largest by trading volume even among exchanges whose trade data is trusted, reported $173 million in 2018 non-U.S. revenue, leading Reuters to estimate Coinbase’s global revenue as north of $500 million. If crypto has proven itself in one use case, it is as a volatile asset for investors hungry to speculate. Our estimate of exchange operators’ fee-based revenue shows this to be true. As such, crypto tokens issued by the exchanges themselves could be among the most useful digital assets in circulation. ""Exchange tokens,"" as they are called, offer holders discounts on trading fees and other benefits. This doesn’t make them anything like equity claims on exchange revenue, which several analysts have pointed out, no matter what buyback mechanisms are employed. It does make them much like the ""utility tokens"" issued in the initial coin offering boom of 2017 and 2018 - or like air miles - and some investors in these tokens embrace that narrative. Unlike air miles, exchange tokens trade freely on a variety of venues. As such it’s surprising that, despite the success of their issuers, the tokens themselves have not been more successful as investments. The table below shows the one-, three-, six-, nine- and 12-month returns of Binance's BNB, Huobi's HT, Bitfinex's LEO and OKEx's OKB, the four exchange tokens that make up the exchange token index provided by FTX, a derivatives exchange operator, as of Jan. 28 (data via Nomics).The benefits to traders, however, can be significant. According to Binance’s fee schedule, the top tier of BNB token holders must today hold about $176,000 worth of the token and trade about $1.2 billion per month on the exchange (with BNB and BTC at current prices of about $16 and $8,000 respectively). For users trading in these volumes,top-tier BNB holdings provide fee discounts that would save them about $720,000 each month, off the standard trading fees - more, if these traders pay the fees themselves in the Binance token. They also provide access to “initial exchange offerings” (IEOs), a new asset issuance operated by the exchange. As such, BNB and other exchange tokens might be expected to serve as indicators as to the relative success of the issuing exchanges. After all, if an open market for air miles existed, you might expect one airline’s miles to trade at a premium to another’s, depending on flyers’ perceptions of their service. At one time, that was true of exchange tokens, but over the course of the past year it's become less and less so. For most of these exchange tokens, the correlation between price and the issuing exchanges' reported volume is weakening over time. (Unlike the exchanges in the revenue chart, not all these exchange token issuers' reported volume is rated trustworthy.) Even as a more general metric, providing an indicator of the broad demand for crypto assets as a speculative investment, exchange tokens are a weak signal. Or, at least, they are no better than the price of bitcoin. At the same time as their prices have drifted from the reported volume of their parent exchanges, exchange tokens' daily returns have hewed more closely to those of bitcoin itself.It's been 11 years since bitcoin was operational and you can make a case that speculation is the best-proven user narrative for the entire asset category. And it is a real use: not everyone in the world has access to volatile assets (and for some, perhaps no asset is volatile enough). For now, exchange tokens appear to be just another flavor of that volatility. Their price movements don't yet support thinking of exchange tokens as a meaningful innovation in use or ownership. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

She did not give a definite date on when the CBDC would be launched.Known as ""Project Bakong"" and first trialed by NBC in July 2019, the CBDC will work on a closed system supported by its banking members, one of them, Phnom Penh Commercial Bank (PPCBank) President Shin Chang Moo, told The Post.Compared to conventional payment and transfer methods including credit and debit cards, Bakong is cheaper and more convenient, Chang Moo said. His bank is rolling out the system at all branches.“We are in the final stages of the deployment,"" he told The Post. ""It has taken a little longer than expected because we were ensuring that the system is as useful and convenient for the users as possible. We will offer the service as soon as it launches,” he said.There is ""zero possibility of speculation"" using the CBDC, Chang moo added.  Users will be able to set up a Bakong wallet that will be automatically linked to their bank accounts, allowing easy fiat currency exchange into the new CBDC in real time. NBC says it will store all transaction data from the platform, suggesting payments may be fully traceable. Users will be able to use the ""quasi-form"" CBDC for everyday payments from their mobile devices. The initiative is expected to support the government's push to introduce QR-based transactions throughout the country. Bakong was designed by the Japanese blockchain company Soramitsu. CEO Makoto Takemiya told CoinDesk that the CBDC ""is simply a tokenized version of the USD and Riel fiat money in NBC's reserves."" ""[T]he system can support any type and number of currencies, including cryptocurrency,"" he added. Soramitsu is currently working on implementing similar systems for other countries around the world.Although Cambodian authorities have cracked down on cryptocurrency trading, NBC had been testing blockchain technology for an interbank payment solution since at least 2017. In October, the bank signed an agreement with a Malaysian bank to begin experimenting with digital wallets for cross-border transactions. Designed initially for domestic payments in Cambodia, NBC plans to integrate a cross-border payments facility into the Bakong platform, Serey said.Bakong already has the support of 11 national banks, with others expected to join soon, according to Serey. “Bakong will play a central role in bringing all players in the payment space in Cambodia under the same platform, making it easy for end-users to pay each other regardless of the institutions they bank with,"" she said.Although this could hit the banking business in the short term, Cambodia's financial system is ""relatively immature,"" Chang Moo told The Post. Bakong will ""create financially inclusive ecosystems that all the stakeholders in the industry can benefit from.""UPDATE (Jan. 30, 19:10 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information about the nature of the CBDC.

A “market taker” is the one who takes liquidity off the market by filling a trade already placed. Exchanges generally try to enhance liquidity on their platforms by offering makers lower fees compared to those offered to takers while filling an order. Binance, however, has upped the ante by announcing what's effectively a reward for placing market-making trades on ""select"" pairs. Binance hasn’t yet disclosed details relating to the negative fee structure. To join the program, market makers must have 30-day trading volumes in excess of 1,000 BTC on Binance, and have ""quality market maker strategies,"" the post says. The exchange will also accept proposals with evidence of similar trading volumes on other platforms. A weekly performance review will be imposed, based on metrics like market volumes, market-making time, bid/offer spread, total order size and order duration. Binance's strategy shift comes as the crypto derivatives space is heating up. Regulated firms including the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Intercontinental Exchange's Bakkt recently started offering bitcoin options after they had offered futures contracts. Binance futures went live in September 2019, with the firm's figures suggesting they've seen solid growth. In January, Binance futures volume witnessed an 85 percent month-on-month increase, with $56 billion traded across its perpetual contract markets. Further, open interest increased 98 percent from $137 million to $271 million as of Jan. 31. Bitcoin (BTC)/tether (USDT) perpetuals remained the most invested contract, comprising 75 percent of its total open interest, according to Binance Research. Perpetuals are no-expiry contracts that mimic a margin-based spot market and trade close to the underlying reference price.

partner Ashwin Ramachandran described this transition as “the death ...","Feb 11, 2020 at 01:19 UTC","The ethereum network is still looking to boost transaction capacity, and the startup Optimism wants to lead the charge. ","Since the network’s throughput is limited to roughly 15 transactions per second, ethereum can’t become a widespread platform for automating functions, like supply chain management and loans, unless it scales. So Optimism aims to use a layered approach, similar to bitcoin’s Lightning Network, to increase the number of people who can use the network with smart contracts.Optimism was once the research-oriented nonprofit Plasma Group, focused on building a second layer for ethereum as described by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and lightning co-creator Joseph Poon in a 2017 paper. Then, in January 2020, the team announced it was transitioning from a research collective to a for-profit startup called Optimism, backed by $3.5 million from Paradigm and IDEO CoLab Ventures.IDEO CoLab’s Dan Elitzer said the Plasma team realized last year, while participating in one of his firm’s programs, that the market didn’t need the solution they were working on. This “led them to develop their Optimistic Rollup approach,” Elitzer said.Some critics in the industry see this transition to a for-profit startup as a controversial move. Bitcoin advocates argue Plasma experiments “failed” and Dragonfly Capital partner Ashwin Ramachandran described this transition as “the death of Plasma.” “It’s like this alien that morphed many times in many different forms and eventually died … at least in the form in which it initially launched,” Ramachandran said in a phone interview.Addressing such concerns, the startup will launch an alpha testing environment on Tuesday called the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM). The OVM, which is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), is meant to give Optimism’s speedier second layer the same smart-contract functionality of the underlying blockchain.“The OVM enables support for all existing Ethereum developer tooling including Solidity and Vyper, testing frameworks like Truffle, wallets like Metamask, and libraries like Web3.js,” the company said in a statement. “We designed the OVM to be used as drop-in replacement for the EVM inside of Optimistic Rollup.”By making smart contracts work above the base layer, ethereum advocates aim to finally make ethereum scalable. Optimism co-founder Ben Jones said this second layer will eventually incorporate optimistic rollups, which process more transactions faster, and some type of the quadratic funding auctions proposed by Glen Weyl. The latter is meant to solve a thorny issue the zcash community recently faced: how to fund the decentralized development of a “public good.”Jones said the details of how this system will work are “still up in the air,” but they’ll probably relate to mining dynamics and network fees.“The order of transactions themselves are valuable,” Jones said, referencing a concept the lightning-friendly exchange Sparkswap discovered last April. There is positional value to crypto transactions inside a payment channel. Just as with lines at Disneyland, some people will buy a FastPass to get to the front.For bitcoin, the startup Lightning Labs recently debuted a payment channel management service called Lightning Loop. Jones said network fees are “generally a flexible concept,” so a version of Plasma could also play into the same demand for speed and channel management to offer contributors a variety of ways to earn value beyond mining ether.It’s too soon to say how the OVM will work, but clearly Buterin’s Plasma dreams are far from dead. Dragonfly’s Ramachandran is quite bullish on optimistic rollups being “the future of ethereum scalability” with “all the things Plasma promised but failed to deliver on.”Yet, he said he is “uncertain” about the second half of Optimism’s plan, quadratic funding that may involve the addition of a network token beyond ether.“I don’t necessarily need my own token. I could just use ether,” Ramachandran said.However, Optimism’s Jones clarified there are no plans for a new network token yet, nor any hard date for a beta launch comparable to what Lightning Labs and Blockstream had for bitcoin in 2018.So far, there are tests underway via the OVM alpha as the startup gears up for production. This solution will be relevant to both the current Eth 1.x and Eth 2.0, ethereum’s upcoming platform overhaul.“We expect the Optimism team to continue to execute on their technical roadmap,” IDEO’s Elitzer said, “while also building the necessary buy-in from key teams in the ecosystem to launch a scaling solution that meets the needs of Ethereum developers and end users.”The startup is still partially Buterin’s brainchild, co-founded by his former Ethereum Foundation collaborator Karl Floersch. With the help of Optimism co-founders Jones and NASDAQ alum Jinglan Wang, the scaling project could leverage a startup model to mature beyond the initial Plasma research.Elitzer said these cofounders make up a “very special team who lives and breathes Ethereum scalability.” Wang, in particular, has been working in the space for more than five years. For Elitzer, the team’s ability to pivot based on feedback is a bullish sign for ethereum, Crypto Twitter obituaries aside.“It’s really important to us to close this economic loop and provide a real revenue source for the creation of open-source software,” Jones said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Released Thursday, the report found 80 percent of the 66 banks surveyed were engaged in some form of work surrounding CBDCs, with nearly 40 percent having moved to experiments and developing proofs of concept. Overall, the number of banks working on some form of CBDC project increased 10 percent from BIS' 2018 survey. Out of the 66 banks polled, 21 came from developed economies with 45 from emerging economies (EMEs). In total, the banks surveyed covered 75 percent of the global population and 90 percent of global economic output.  Although around 70 percent of central banks said it was unlikely they would release a CBDC in the forseeable future, another 30 percent of respondents said they had active plans to issue some form of digital currency, with about 10 percent saying they were already developing pilot projects.Asked how close some of these CBDC projects under intensive development were to completion, 20 percent said a CBDC could be issued within the next six years. Another 10 percent were reported to be ""imminently close"" to launching a digital currency to the general public, possibly by 2023, according to the report: ""Central banks representing a fifth of the world’s population say they are likely to issue the first CBDCs in the next few years.""BIS does not explicitly name any of the central banks that are close to issuing CBDCs, but the report includes two test cases from the central banks of the Bahamas and the Eastern Caribbean, which have both confirmed digital currency pilot projects. It's also well known China, a country with more than 1.2 billion people, has also developed its own CBDC. Designed as a new payments solution, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) said in November the digital yuan initiative was currently in the testing stage.Furthermore, seven central banks, including the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank (ECB) as well as BIS, all announced Tuesday they had formed a working group to share findings of the ""economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability"" of CBDCs.Although many EME central banks said they had other priorities, the BIS survey concluded that emerging economies generally had more incentive to issue CBDCs. Every bank that had progressed to active development or pilot projects came from an emerging economy, researchers found. ""EMEs have generally stronger motivations than advanced economies to work on general purpose CBDCs,"" the survey said. EME respondents said CBDCs could help promote financial inclusion and increase stability, as well as improve payments efficiency and safety. In comparison, the survey found central banks from developed economies felt digital currencies may only prove to be ""very important"" for improving payments safety.But central banks from emerging and developed economies believed CBDCs could address the declining use of cash as a means of payment. ""EME central banks [are] aiming to reduce reliance on cash, and advanced economies [are] acting to pre-empt any issues that might be faced by the general public in accessing central bank money,"" according to the survey. Public interest in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin remained static, responded central banks. Similar to the 2018 survey, many respondents said it remained a peripheral activity in their jurisdictions, with limited viability as an alternative payments solution. Few respondents said the motivation for CBDC research stemmed from any concerns surrounding cryptocurrencies.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It will also give Treasury more fire power to, as the budget reads, “disrupt terrorist financing, hold rogue states and human rights abusers accountable, and detect and deter financial crimes.”The Secret Service is better known for protecting U.S. presidents and their families, but it is also responsible for investigating a wide range of financial crimes including fraud and counterfeiting, among others. “Technological advancements in recent decades, such as cryptocurrencies and the increasing interconnectedness of the international financial marketplace, have resulted in more complex criminal organizations and revealed stronger links between financial and electronic crimes and the financing of terrorists and rogue state actors,” according to the document. That may be why the people behind the budget think the Secret Service, the sole office charged with the protection of U.S. currency, could give a major boost to Treasury’s cyber crime-fighting efforts.At Treasury, the Secret Service’s cryptocurrency investigations could dovetail with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a money-laundering watchdog that monitors cryptocurrency-related violations of the Banking Secrecy Act. DHS, the Secret Service and branches within the Treasury Department have already spent millions of dollars on blockchain analytics, tapping Chainalysis to provide software tools and services.Trump's budget is a long way from becoming law, though.

But three of the five witnesses – Maples, Congressional Research Service finance expert Rena Miller and Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Senior Vice President George Selim – addressed crypto’s role in their written and oral testimonies.  Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a longtime crypto skeptic, pressed Maples for instances of domestic use, saying: “If it works for Hamas, it will work for the Nazis, too.”Maples responded: “We do see evidence that domestic terror groups are realizing that foreign terror groups like Hamas have been operating using bitcoin due to the encryption [and] due to the difficulties in tracking those transactions.”Still, government officials have successfully exploited bitcoin’s inherent blockchain traceability to bust high-profile crime rings. Last October, investigators dismantled the world's largest operating child pornography site by using analysis software.Maples told the committee in his written testimony that one such donation came immediately after the Charlottesville, Virginia, attack in 2017: $60,000 in bitcoin to Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin. “We cannot discount the future use of cryptocurrencies as a means to fund acts of domestic extremism within New Jersey and across the United States,” Maples wrote in his prepared remarks.Selim, the ADL executive, also provided testimony of bitcoin’s past use in supporting white nationalists. He cited reports that neo-Nazi troll Andrew “weev” Auernheimer has received massive sums in donated bitcoin, as have white supremacist internet forums like Stormfront and the Daily Stormer. He nonetheless noted that cryptocurrency businesses like Coinbase enforce sweeping anti-hate policies that prevent customers from transacting in such ways.  “Cryptocurrencies are not a panacea for white supremacists’ money transfer difficulties,” Selim wrote in his testimony.Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) asked Maples how governments can get ahead of the crypto trend.“We have to put stringent oversight in place,” Maples said, specifying that this would include ensuring the right people are aware of the risks around crypto as well as monitoring crypto movements themselves.Vargas made clear his belief that government oversight of cryptocurrencies should not turn into overreach. Vargas asked Maples how the government might show restraint and “do it in such a way that we’re able to track this money but at the same time not be so involved in their lives?” Maples said the government must “remain mindful” of constitutional rights.“If we get the processes right and in conjunction with the right amount of oversight I think we can get to the right answer to protect and defend our country,” he said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

At the Blockstack Summit in San Francisco in ...","Jan 30, 2020 at 17:15 UTC","The man who wrote Mastering Bitcoin, Andreas Antonopoulos, is anything but a bitcoin maximalist.","At the Blockstack Summit in San Francisco in October, he spoke about a subject that's already proving to be one of the most-watched topics going into 2020: inter-blockchain communication (IBC).""I find it astounding after all this time that people still try to follow this idea of ‘winner takes all.’ One coin to rule them all. One chain above all else. We're coming for ya. The flippening,"" Antonopoulos said. The ""flippening"" is the conviction that ethereum's $19 billion market cap will one day best bitcoin's $170 billion (which is the basic idea behind any maximalism for any other cryptocurrency – ETH-heads just have a name for it). ""The data just doesn't support that hypothesis,"" Antonopoulos said.Still, it's not a position crypto OGs love to embrace, which explains why the very first thing Antonopoulos says in his talk is: ""I bring you heresy."" In short, he argues there will be many distributed blockchains in the future and that many of them will be quite useful. And he is not alone in that conviction.""We're going to continue to see blockchains get built with very specialized ideas in mind,"" Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz told CoinDesk. Just look to bitcoin owning value and ethereum owning smart contracts, he said. ""Mass adoption will be more likely in the future of interconnected blockchains,"" Lallouz added. In short, look for developers to choose between distributed networks in the same way they choose between coding languages like Haskell and Python today.""As a company, we're pretty bullish on this idea and bullish on protocols like Cosmos and Polkadot that are being built directly to service the interconnected blockchain nature of the future in our ecosystem,"" Lallouz wrote.There have been other developments in the space, too, such as ETH-oriented Loom reaching the Tron and Binance chains and Summa providing interoperability solutions. So much investment has gone into this category of solutions that the IBC future is probably something like a consensus position across the industry. In fact, if Antonopoulos had a contrarian take it was this: The optimal interoperability solution is already here, and it is bitcoin's most popular Layer 2 technology, the lightning network.It could be years before it's clear which solution companies rally around, but broadly speaking, IBC is like every big trend in crypto: Not everyone sees it the same way.""Personally, I believe that the rising tide lifts all boats and that many projects can benefit from the efforts of each other,"" Bruce Fenton, founder of the Bitcoin Association and the Satoshi Roundtable, told CoinDesk. Fenton is now focused on a new cryptocurrency, ravencoin.Keld van Schreven, a co-founder of crypto investment firm KR1, argued IBC yields an effect that is greater than the sum of its parts. ""Without IBC we will just have a limited horizon of possibility,"" he said.Van Schreven sees the shift to IBC as a sort of enlightenment moment for the technology, even taking it so far as to suggest that it might “reduce the tribalism” that plagues the crypto ecosystem.But it's one thing to propose interoperability and another thing to actually get it built. It also introduces a new level of complexity.""The ethereum world has benefited tremendously from the composability of smart contracts, where one protocol can make use of another protocol in order to build up and up towards something higher-level and more useful to the end-user,"" Doug Petkanics, of Livepeer, a decentralized video transcoding service, told CoinDesk. “But to date, composability has been halted at the boundaries of ethereum.”Composability is the idea that software can be put together like Lego blocks in ways that its creators might not have anticipated. It’s a nice idea, but it starts to get complicated in practice.Aliaksandr Hudzilin is part of the team behind Near Protocol, which is using sharding to build a highly scalable blockchain. He told CoinDesk that one of his developers participated in a conversation about IBC at Devcon 2019 in Osaka, Japan, including the Ethereum Foundation, Cosmos and Polkadot.Hudzilin’s interpretation of the conversation was that ""none of them had sat down and talked about it,” he said. “It's kind of the beginning of the dialogue.""From the vantage point of the Devcon developers, blockchains sharing tokens and data starts to look much easier discussed than executed.And then there's the question of why teams should even bother plugging in.""You have an adoption challenge to convince people to refactor in order to support interoperability standards,"" Stephane Gosselin of the engineering team at Numerai told CoinDesk. “From my experience, the latter is an uphill battle.”Gosselin said the business case just isn't there yet to justify teams doing the work.Electric Capital's Avichal Garg sounded a similar note: The wait for IBC will be long, he said.""Interoperability only matters if there is real activity happening on multiple chains and right now there are really only two that have significant activity (BTC and ETH), and several that have the beginnings of activity,"" Garg wrote.And, of course, there are those who don't see much point in interoperability to begin with.Spencer Bogart, a general partner at Blockchain Capital, diverges from Antonopoulos on one point, believing only a very few chains will matter in the end. In fact, it could be just ethereum and bitcoin, Bogart said. ""I think the area of intrablockchain communication will be a far more important and salient topic going forward than interblockchain communication – that is, solving for compatibility and functionality 'up the stack' of winning protocols."" Ben Waters, of the multi-asset Nervos Network, thinks it might be simpler than all that. It could be that every blockchain that survives only needs to talk to one other blockchain, and that's bitcoin.""Interoperability of PBNs [public blockchain networks] that serve very similar functions and tend to have the same apps, programming models and economic models is largely pointless,"" Waters wrote in an email. ""Additionally, if PBN tokens are largely interchangeable, everyone will want to hold the hardest, most secure token.”But some bitcoin maximalists take it further than that.""Blockchains are waste,"" Udi Wertheimer, a well-known skeptic of Satoshi's descendant technologies, told CoinDesk. ""Interoperability between blockchains makes as much sense as interoperability between polluting gases.""But, in a way, the idea that one machine will dominate squares with the view Antonopoulos espoused in October.""I'm really fascinated by the strong possibility that while we will have many chains, in the end, they will all come together under one network,"" Antonopoulos said. ""One network, many chains.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Feb 6, 2020 at 16:00 UTC",SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce wants to give legitimate crypto projects a shot at success without running afoul of U.S. securities laws.,"The two-year official at the Securities and Exchange Commission – nicknamed “CryptoMom” by the blockchain community – has formally proposed a safe harbor for token projects. It would give them some breathing room to develop their networks and communities before having to worry about the regulatory regime.Under Peirce’s proposal, unveiled during a speech at the International Blockchain Congress in Chicago Thursday, crypto startups would have a three-year grace period from their first token sale to achieve a level of decentralization sufficient to pass through the agency’s securities evaluations, including the Howey Test, the famous U.S. Supreme Court assessment. To date, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against a number of companies that created and sold tokens, including Telegram and Kik, two major messaging platforms. “The analysis of whether a token is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the digital asset,” according to notes detailing the proposal. In other words, some tokens may appear to have the qualities of a security at launch but mature to the point where it no longer appears to be one. Ether, the native token of the ethereum blockchain, may be one such example: SEC Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman, speaking on his own behalf and not the agency’s in June 2018, said ether by that point did not appear to be a security. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton later appeared to endorse this view, writing that digital assets could at some point no longer be investment contracts (though he did not mention ether specifically). Notably, Hinman suggested ether may have begun its life as a security but its network evolved in subsequent years. A similar transition was also seen with EOS. The SEC settled charges with the company last year, saying the original ERC-20 EOS token was a security, but the project's final EOS token was not (holders migrated from the ERC-20 token to a native version after the network was fully built out).“The application of the federal securities laws to these transactions frustrates the network’s ability to achieve maturity and prevents the transformation of the token sold as a security to a non-security token functioning on the network,” Peirce said in notes detailing the proposal.Peirce has floated the idea of a safe harbor in the past, but Thursday's proposal is the first formal attempt to make it a reality.If adopted by the majority of the SEC’s other commissioners, it would create a strict set of requirements for crypto projects to raise funds through a token sale, including requiring personal disclosures, code disclosures, public notices and a number of other factors.“The safe harbor is also designed to protect token purchasers by requiring disclosures tailored to the needs of the purchasers and preserving the application of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws,” according to Peirce’s notes.Specifically, the proposal defines an “initial development team,” which will manage the network’s development over its first three years, and “network maturity,” referring to a network that is “not controlled and is not reasonably likely to be controlled” by a single entity or individual but is operational.The development team should disclose “the names and relevant experience, qualifications, attributes or skills” of each member, as well as how many tokens each member holds and how many they may earn through founders' rewards or similar programs.“The definition of Network Maturity is intended to provide clarity as to when a token transaction should no longer be considered a security transaction but, as always, the analysis will require an evaluation of the particular facts and circumstances,” the proposal states.At the end of the grace period, the initial development team will have to determine whether token transactions constitute securities transactions. The team should look to create liquidity for the token by securing secondary trading markets (which remain compliant with applicable money transmission and consumer protection laws) on top of their development efforts.""Admittedly, the liquidity condition may surprise observers of SEC staff positions in which attempts to facilitate secondary trading have been viewed as indicia of a securities offering,"" Peirce said during her speech. ""In the context of the safe harbor, by contrast, secondary trading is recognized as necessary both to get tokens into the hands of people that will use them and offer developers and people who provide services on the network a way to exchange their tokens for fiat or cryptocurrency.""Also in an effort to bolster consumer protection, Commissioner Peirce’s proposal would require a token project’s source code, transaction history (and a description of how an individual can independently search transaction history), token economics, roadmap and a history of past token sales all be disclosed on a free and publicly accessible website.The safe harbor proposal is dependent on development teams acting in good faith, Peirce said.It would not be available to any teams with members who are already disqualified ""as a bad actor under the securities laws"" due to past actions. Moreover, while the proposal would preempt any state securities laws, it would not protect projects from any enforcement actions taken due to fraud or other illicit activities. ""SEC enforcement has played an important role in combating fraud in connection with token sales,"" she said. ""The safe harbor would not provide immunity from such actions.""Nor does Peirce's proposal imply exclusivity; projects can still operate under existing federal securities laws such as Regulation D or S or other valid exemptions under the law. The proposal would also not likely apply to projects that are already operational, Peirce said. Her goal is to focus on new projects in their initial stages of development so as to ensure they can move beyond their first steps in building a network or community.""This bad actor provision is not directed at teams that set forth a plan for a network and work earnestly toward building it, but fail to bring it to fruition. Rather, it is designed to ensure that the SEC can bring suit against a team that sets out to defraud token purchasers by materially misrepresenting or omitting key information,"" Peirce said. ""We all know that there are plenty of those kinds of 'projects' polluting the crypto space.""Read the full text of the proposal below:UPDATE (Feb. 7, 18:55 UTC): This article has been updated to include the full text of SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's speech and safe harbor proposal.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

As part of its efforts in interoperability, Kadena is also integrating its wallet Chainweaver with the Cosmos Network, allowing different blockchains to interact.The integration process is expected to be complete by March. Using Kadena, individuals or businesses can begin looking at apps and projects that use “a fully-scalable base layer as a piece of public infrastructure” while maintaining privacy features to address any regulatory or other concerns, founder and president Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk.Using an in-house smart contract language called Pact, Kadena said the advancement introduces a “hybrid blockchain” model capable of processing 750 transactions per second, though 750 is just Kadena’s conservative estimate. Popejoy, who previously directed JP Morgan's Blockchain Center of Excellence, said his protocol’s braided blockchain design can accommodate even industrial use cases. According to Popejoy, the durability of ethereum and bitcoin proves PoW’s value but their failures to reliably process transactions (bitcoin) or grow to the demands of decentralized apps (ethereum) makes them unsuitable for enterprise use cases. Public chains are also anathema to certain sensitive contexts such as medical privacy issues, he said. “Kadena’s whole goal is to solve the scaling problems of bitcoin and the security problems of ethereum,” Popejoy said.The hybrid model based on a PoW protocol hopes to take on this issue by essentially allowing users to switch between chains using the Pact programming language.“You have a scalable private blockchain, you have a scalable public blockchain and you have Pact, and the application layer that allows you to communicate between all three,” Popejoy said.  Kadena said a number of companies already plan to utilize its hybrid blockchain model in finance and healthcare, including Rymedi, a South Carolina medical technology firm and facilitator of an FDA-approved study of blockchain tracing specialty prescription drugs.To further aid its scaling and interoperability goals, Kadena hopes to conclude its Cosmos integration by the end of March.As part of the move, Kadena will make Pact available on Cosmos as Kadenamint, meaning developers will be able to create smart contracts using Kadena’s token starting Wednesday. “Besides storing cryptocurrencies, our multi-blockchain wallet can provide a tool kit and user-friendly programming environment for developers on the Cosmos Network,” said Kadena founder Will Martino, another JPMorgan veteran, once lead engineer for the bank's blockchain prototype, Juno. Developers can write smart contracts for both Cosmos and Kadena from the same interface using Chainweaver. The wallet includes features such as Formal Verification and capabilities-based security, according to Martino. To fund its operations, Kadena raised $15 million in 2018 from investors including Multicoin Capital and the private investment arm of the owners of Fidelity Investments. The firm aims to raise another $20 million via a token sale. Ethan Buchman, technical director of the Interchain Foundation, one of Cosmos’ largest backers, said in a statement that scalability, security and usability are all major issues to address.""We're working with Kadena to integrate their digital wallet Chainweaver into the larger Cosmos ecosystem to tackle these issues like never before, enabling users to build Pact smart contracts running on the Tendermint consensus engine through Chainweaver's stellar UX,"" Buchman said.  UPDATE (Jan. 15, 20:05 UTC): While Kadena was founded by JPMorgan alumni, the company is not technically a spinoff.

It allows institutional clients to trade cryptocurrencies without any settlement risk. Trades happen simultaneously through an atomic settlement system within the custodian itself that requires both parties to approve it before going through.The settlement layer is designed to protect trades from theft and so that neither side can renege on the deal midway through. ""There is no single second in time where one party holds the other party's funds,"" Tasman told CoinDesk. Because funds never actually leave cold storage at any point during the transaction, they remain fully insured.The solution, which connects BitGo custodial accounts using an API integration, relies on liquidity providers to match price offers with the best quotes on either the buy or sell side. Initially restricted to bitcoin, ether and US dollars, SettleBit plans to add other assets in the near future. The feature is currently only available to BitGo clients who have an established trading relationship with SettleBit. But the company will expand its settlement layer to other custodial solutions so it can facilitate secure cross-custody trading. Tasman confirmed to CoinDesk that Kingdom Trust clients would be integrated later this quarter. BitGo had previously partnered with Genesis Global Trading to create a similar custodial settlement solution. Work began in January 2019 but no trades have yet been processed.

Suisse's OpenVASP, CipherTrace's TRISA, Sygna Bridge, Netki, ...","Feb 4, 2020 at 16:10 UTC",Imagine SWIFT’s interbank messaging system but for crypto.,"Hardcore blockchain libertarians would probably rather not. But firms that deal in cryptocurrency have been asked to abide by the so-called “Travel Rule,” and the clock is ticking.Although it goes against the grain to shoehorn an identity layer onto a technology specifically designed to be pseudonymous, firms have no choice if they want to abide by the law. The shape and form this will take is something the industry must agree on, and fast.In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global anti-money laundering (AML) watchdog, updated its guidance to explicitly state that virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, must share sender (originator) and receiver (beneficiary) information in cryptocurrency transactions above a certain threshold.With the one-year mark fast approaching, the FATF will review progress on Travel Rule solutions at its June 2020 plenary meeting. Meanwhile, U.S. regulator FinCEN issued its version of the regulation pertaining to VASPs in May 2019, stating that firms had 180 days to get their houses in order. This means the Travel Rule now carries the weight of law regarding U.S.-based VASPs. (VASPs are businesses that conduct the exchange, transfer or safekeeping of virtual assets, as well as activities relating to issuing or underwriting virtual assets.)There are differences of opinion over the best technical solution, with some favoring a blockchain-based approach and others not. Equally challenging are the operational and legal hurdles crypto exchanges face in rolling out a compliant system en masse.   There are two parts to the problem. First, there needs to be some means of identifying VASPs. This could be broadly equivalent to the Bank Identifier Code (BIC) used by SWIFT or something like the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) system. The second part of the problem concerns data transmission. The ideal solution crypto businesses and industry groups are working towards would be a standards-based and interoperable message layer between VASPs, allowing identity, authentication and messaging to be pinned onto blockchain transactions.There are some 20-plus solutions being built to tackle the problem. Some are relatively small-scale commercial endeavors, while others involve groups of participating firms and behave more like open protocols.Some of the offerings mentioned in the working group arena include Bitcoin Suisse’s OpenVASP, CipherTrace’s TRISA, Sygna Bridge, Netki, Shyft and KYC Chain. Dedicated crypto-sleuthing firms including Elliptic, Coinfirm and Chainalysis have all been working on this as well. Indeed, Chainalysis recently hired former FinCEN staffer Mike Mosier to help build Travel Rule capabilities.There are proposals that favor a more traditional battle-tested approach – such as having a centralized global registry of VASP addresses as a necessary trust anchor – and then there are the solutions taking a more decentralized approach, involving blockchains or DLT.“The assumption that blockchain must have the solution to something that is a blockchain problem may not necessarily be true – as desirable as that may be for folks at an aspirational level, philosophically,” said Siân Jones, senior partner at XReg Consulting and convener of the Joint Working Group for InterVASP Messaging Standards (JWG-IVMS).Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at trade group Global Digital Finance said his view (and the view of some regulators) is there needs to be more than one tech provider. “So it might be that Coinbase chooses Tech Provider A; Binance uses Provider B,” he said. “So we end up with a matrix, with smaller exchanges copying the larger ones they want to work with.”Switzerland’s OpenVASP project is what you might expect from a country that’s relatively advanced when it comes to meeting FATF recommendations, and has even gone beyond them in some respects.The project is helmed by Bitcoin Suisse and also includes Lykke exchange and crypto banks Seba and Sygnum. The Swiss have taken a practical approach, building a solution the industry can start using as quickly as possible.A key design principle for OpenVASP is decentralization, which means avoiding the mistakes of the past, say its developers, like having a single point of failure, central servers and directories. In order to achieve decentralization where it’s deemed desirable, OpenVASP is leveraging a selection of features from ethereum.For instance, at its messaging layer, OpenVASP proposes using Whisper, ethereum’s off-chain peer-to-peer messaging system. (To be clear, the OpenVASP white paper points out other messaging systems can be used.)Whisper employs so-called dark routing to obscure message content and sender and receiver details to observers, a bit like anonymous web browsing using Tor, making it a neat way to meet privacy requirements.“This means that nobody would be able to understand that two VASPs are interacting with each other,” said David Riegelnig, head of risk management at Bitcoin Suisse. “With respect to competitiveness, it should be nobody's business to know which VASPs interact, as long as the VASPs comply with their Travel Rule requirements and can do their sanctions checks screening and so forth.”The addressing and authentication parts of the OpenVASP solution use ethereum’s decentralized public key infrastructure, meaning the VASP must deploy a smart contract that represents identity on the blockchain. Using smart contracts on ethereum creates a blockchain public key directory for the VASP and an IBAN-like numbering format: the virtual asset account number (VAAN).“The alternative could be a global directory of VASPs with their public keys, which sounds very simple,” said Riegelnig. “But then you have to ask, ‘In which country is this server going to stand? In which jurisdiction? Who controls it?’ And so on.”Obviously there are going to be people who are concerned that OpenVASP is tied to ethereum, Riegelnig said. “They think it’s everything on the blockchain. But the only thing we actually use on ethereum is the smart contract where you store the public key,” he said. “Then these concerns tend to get much smaller.”OpenVASP said it is in talks with all the big exchanges and named Binance, Kraken and Bitstamp as three that are looking at its solution. Having read the other white papers, Riegelnig said that, with the possible exception of very centralized commercial projects, they all involve some intangible parts that are basically high-level ideas.Riegelnig said OpenVASP was “on the same page” as CipherTrace when it comes to exchanging end-to-end encrypted messages and not having a persistent blockchain data layer. But elsewhere there are shortcomings, he said.“They [CipherTrace] somehow still rely on blockchain addresses as the identifier between VASPs. That is not very practical because public blockchain addresses change all the time,” said Riegelnig. “When you have a client and you want to transfer crypto to other VASPs, it’s much easier if you can refer to this client or their account by a client number, instead of an ever-changing blockchain address number.”CipherTrace’s TRISA uses public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate authorities. A “know-your-VASP” certificate would be sent from the exchange originating a transaction to the one receiving it. These certificates would be verified through a trusted third-party certificate authority.CipherTrace Chief Financial Analyst John Jefferies pointed out that while a certificate authority might be controlled by a central entity, there are typically multiple distributed instances and therefore does not constitute a single point of failure.“By avoiding global directories, OpenVASP is also avoiding known good security, and betting the whole thing on the ethereum blockchain,” said Jefferies.“The thing about public key is that there are a lot of service providers and there can be numerous competing service providers. So while it's not like the one grand VASP PKI in the sky, if one comes and another goes then people can change and they can adopt those certificates,” he said.As far as interoperability is concerned, ethereum keys on OpenVASP can be supported by PKI, said Jefferies: PKI is extensible so the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. This speaks to a wider issue. “Switzerland has some strict rules, but they don't have a lot of interoperability with the U.S., and so I think the interoperability in this case is an important component,” Jefferies said.While firms duke it out for the best technical solution, agreeing on a standard format to handle the message payloads will simplify things, at least on one level.“The timeline could be dramatically reduced and the costs minimized if there was an open standard, like ISO or IEEE standards,” said Jones of the InterVASP group. This would be a common universal language for the transfer of data, regardless of any national legislation, and regardless of which technological solution the VASP plugs into, she said.The InterVASP group has been joined by a coalition of trade bodies including Global Digital Finance, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and the International Digital Asset Exchange Association (IDAXA). The goal of the InterVASP group is to have a standard in place and ready for adoption by May 8, during New York Blockchain Week.Standardizing the underlying messaging packet is a good path to follow, said Wright of Global Digital Finance. In situations like this, something as simple as date of birth, for example, might cause problems, Wright said. DOBs could be in U.K. format, U.S. format or long-form actual format.“If every provider chose its own format, the cost of actually deciphering it on receipt and then making sure you have accurately transposed it is quite significant,” he said. “So having even the simplest of things like that in a format that makes sense goes a long way to standardize the industry.”Wright acknowledged the stigma around the idea of a “SWIFT for crypto,” which instantly raises hackles. “If you’ve got the same order of fields and the same name of fields, and you know how to deal with transliteration and so forth, all agreed by the industry, then that part of SWIFT, in essence, is a reasonable thing,” he said.Exchanging personal data between VASPs in different parts of the world could require detailed legal frameworks in order to not run afoul of regulations like GDPR, said Coinfirm CEO Pawel Kuskowski.For this reason, Coinfirm, which has also formed a working group and claims to have government backing for that endeavor, has pulled in Gibraltar-based crypto lawyer Joey Garcia, partner at ISOLAS LLP, and London-based Dean Armstrong QC, head of chambers at the 36 Group.Coinfirm is using a high-throughput permissioned blockchain for writing the “fingerprint” of a compliant transaction, built on the enterprise-grade DLT Hyperledger Fabric. The latter employs a private channel architecture, which has been compared to private message channels on Slack.“There are two parts to consider when you are talking about the Travel Rule,” Kuskowski said. “One is part is technological and the other is regulatory. Really anyone who is touching this has to have someone from the legal space.”Jefferies of CipherTrace said solving the technical challenge is not any greater than the operational hurdle, or “sunrise problem” of switching on the system for 500 VASPs at once.As G20 countries gradually begin to roll this out, increased jurisdictional arbitrage seems likely, he added.“People are going to lean towards the countries with either weak implementation or enforcement,” Jefferies said. “It will be interesting to see how this scenario plays out.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours.  NEWS ROUNDUPBrad Keoun: Bitcoin’s price has hit a seven-week high of $8,463 during Asian hours after Iran launched missile attacks at two U.S. military bases in Iraq. So far, no casualties have been reported.Trade is off a bit in the past several hours as Iran's foreign minister said it had concluded its attacks and that it did not seek an escalation of war. But markets were also keeping an eye on the crash of a Ukraine International Airlines flight that took off from Tehran early Wednesday, killing more than 170 people. Iranian news services have reported the crash was due to technical failure by the Boeing plane.For crypto markets, investors are continuing to watch to see if bitcoin's correlation with gold, a typical safe-haven asset in times of geopolitical and economic turmoil, will continue to strengthen.Adam: Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone writes in a Crypto Outlook report that bitcoin is ""winning the adoption race""  partly because of its store-of-value properties, at a time when the market environment favors independent quasi-currencies.He predicts bitcoin prices could track upward with gold this year, potentially edging toward last year’s high around $14,000. The first-born crypto is winning as it evolves into a digital version of gold, McGlone writes.Brad: And in news on what could be the world’s biggest bitcoin mine, Whinstone’s planned $150 million facility in Rockdale, Texas, has reportedly signed up two Japanese corporate customers.SBI Holdings and GMO have agreed to rent mining capacity at the facility, with operations set to start in the coming months, Bloomberg News reports.CoinDesk reported in November that the bitcoin mine would have an initial power usage of 300 megawatts, expanding to 1 gigawatt, dwarfing a nearby facility built by Bitmain, the giant Chinese maker of bitcoin-mining computers.Adam: Turning to regulatory news, a unit of the U.S. Securities and Exchange devoted to inspections and examinations has released its list of top priorities for 2020, and digital assets are ranked as an “area of concern.”The SEC office says it wants to address the investment suitability of digital assets, along with trading practices, fund safety, pricing and the effectiveness of compliance programs.The SEC office noted that the market for digital assets has grown rapidly, and might present risks for retail investors who don’t understand the differences between crypto and more traditional financial products.Brad:  And finally, crypto is coming to the courtroom. CoinDesk’s Paddy Baker reports that the Swiss-based crypto project Aragon has started recruiting jurors ahead of its planned launch of a new decentralized court system. Starting on Tuesday, participants in the Aragon project could exchange their ANT tokens for newly minted Aragon Network Juror Tokens that can then be used to sign up to serve as jurors in disputes adjudicated in Aragon’s courtroom.   Jurors who serve are eligible for rewards paid out in - you guessed it, more tokens.FEATURE - Cars Paying CarsAdam: Turning to today’s featured segment, we’re talking Sony, cars and crypto.  The CoinDesk team has been in Las Vegas all week for the annual Consumer Electronics Show - better known as CES. Here’s what we know, according to CoinDesk Editor John Biggs.There is a school of thought that believes the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain happens when robots begin paying robots. These robots might be cleaning our houses, taking care of our elders or driving us around. Cryptocurrency becomes the value transfer medium in this scenario and all of the sensors, computers and systems associated with washing our floors or getting us around connect to the worldwide internet of value and, in the end, supplant most payment methods.Car manufacturers probably won't play ball. Car sales and car manufacturers depend on a few things, the primary one being that a human will buy an expensive hunk of steel and spend quite a while behind the wheel. Sony and Apple and Intel and countless mobility startups aren't harnessed to that antiquated notion. To them, cars are computers. So, it did not go unnoticed when...Sony announced a car – a real, physical vehicle with wheels and seats. Obviously, this car, called the Vision-S, is a prototype and you probably won't be going down to Best Buy to pick up some USB-C cables and a new Sony whip. But the simple fact remains that an electronics and software company is moving into real-world mobility.The Sony car is packed with sensors – lidar, radar and cameras – and 360-degree audio with a huge, wraparound screen to entertain the driver. It is, in short, the beginning of a car-creation model that pulls the industry out of the 1900s and into the 2000s.The electric vehicle is built on Sony's own platform, which it plans to use in multiple body configurations. It has a reported zero-to-60-mph time of 4.8 seconds, according to Car and Driver, and a max speed of 149 mph. It's a real car with real power.We know very little about Sony's future car plans and the concept model is far from ready for the market. But eventually, this car and many like it will be communicating with each other wirelessly and negotiating traffic automatically. Your wallet will take a hit if you want to get somewhere faster  —  your car will pay another car to get ahead of them  —  and you'll spend or even earn if you can spare a few more minutes on the road. Roads themselves will request tolls for maintenance and, as we sit in relative comfort, we'll be making requests for applications, educational materials and entertainment. And, if Facebook, Apple and Amazon have their way, we won't be swiping a credit card.All of this assumes Sony and Apple and Google and Amazon are all thinking the same thing. Thus far, it seems they are. They are computing companies. Computing is built on open standards, and anything traditional car manufacturers do to prevent that openness will earn them a spot outside of the network. The new driverless, self-negotiating cars will also face driver resistance. Maybe we'll have a future where petulant car lovers boast they are both ""rolling coal"" and ""rolling meat"" by driving their antiquated vehicles manufactured before, say, 2025. But anything that stands in front of the onslaught of driverless, constantly negotiating vehicles will be run over.In the end, maybe this Sony car is a random pop on the future's horizon. Or maybe it's something else: the beginning of a firework show that will truly take this extremely nascent technology mainstream. All we can say right now is people are excited about what's to come.SPOTLIGHT - Crypto LiquidityAdam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at the evolving concept of liquidity, in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency markets. Brad: That’s right, Adam, today we want to highlight a really smart report out this week from our colleagues on the ColnDesk Research team, Noelle Acheson and Galen Moore, looking at liquidity in crypto markets.Liquidity is one of those market terms that gets tossed around frequently by analysts, and crypto markets have idiosyncrasies that make liquidity an even more complicated subject than in traditional markets.In this context, the authors looked at liquidity as a measure of, generally speaking, how easily a given crypto asset can be bought or sold in a reasonably large quantity without moving the price much.Bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency and the largest by market value around $150 billion, is by far the most liquid, according to the authors, and most crypto investors can enter and exit a reasonably sized position with relative ease. Yet, as we have often seen, a large order can whiplash the price. One key issue is that these markets are quite fragmented, with a handful of large exchanges operating in several jurisdictions, alongside medium-size regional exchanges and hundreds of other niche exchanges geared toward specific types of traders.That spreads trading volumes across a range of venues, diluting the liquidity.The contrast is with traditional financial markets, where there tend to be fewer exchanges to choose from, so there’s less liquidity dilution.  A more diluted trading volume makes it harder to execute a large order without affecting the price. To place a big order without moving the price, a client may need to use various exchanges, resulting in higher costs, and that could serve as a barrier for some investors from accumulating a large trading position. A thriving over-the-counter, or OTC, market has sprung up to solve these problems, but there’s not an abundance of reliable data on how much volume these OTC desks account for. Another key aspect of liquidity in crypto markets is the role of stablecoins, or digital assets like Tether whose price is pegged to government-issued currencies such as the U.S. dollar. These stablecoins can be moved rapidly from exchange to exchange, allowing investors to reduce the balances they have to hold at individual exchanges, and thus reducing their cost of capital. The authors conclude that the unusually fragmented structure of crypto markets thins order books, increasing the cost of trading by requiring traders to execute across a range of exchanges or by pushing large orders onto the OTC market.  But they make the point that crypto infrastructure is evolving rapidly to overcome liquidity obstacles. Those could include market consolidation as well as the growing use of prime brokers, which cater to hedge funds with brokerage services and trading loans, as well as with enhanced data reporting and metrics analysis. There’s also the possibility that simply the entry of more money into crypto markets might do the trick.According to the report, more liquidity could come from greater mainstream interest in crypto assets, perhaps triggered by the upcoming “bitcoin halving” in May or by the emergence of liquid derivative markets for a broader range of investors. This could bring fresh demand for cryptocurrencies, accelerate the compression of trading bid-offer spreads and trigger the introduction of further liquidity-enhancing measures. What’s more, growing liquidity generally tends to reduce volatility, which in turn might lead to even more liquidity.OUTTROAdam: Join us again on Thursday for the next Markets Daily from CoinDesk.  To make sure you never miss an episode, you can subscribe to Markets daily on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and just about any other place you’d like to listen.  If you’re enjoying the show, we really appreciate you leaving a review.

mysterious creator, and licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority ...","Jan 16, 2020 at 12:00 UTC","Gemini, the crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has created its own insurance company to protect clients against the potential loss of coins from its offline vaults – with a possibly record-breaking $200 million coverage limit.","Announced Thursday, the captive insurer will provide coverage for customers of Gemini Custody, the crypto cold storage service of Gemini Trust Company. Typically, cold storage policies cover losses due to insider thefts and collusion, as well as the destruction of private keys by natural disasters like floods, earthquakes and so on. Cold storage refers to the practice of keeping the cryptographic keys controlling a crypto wallet offline, on a hardware device disconnected from the internet or a slip of paper locked in a safe.Aside from its size, the Gemini policy is another sign the once-meager supply of insurance coverage available to crypto firms is growing – even if they have to create some of it. Last year, insurance broker Aon and crypto exchange Coinbase announced plans to create a captive; Aon said it had captive creation deals with other exchanges in the pipeline. Gemini’s new policy, which supplements its captive with coverage from outside insurers, has “the largest limit of insurance coverage currently available by any crypto custodian in the world,” said Yusuf Hussain, the company’s head of risk. He may be right, although it is hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons in this market. Coinbase has said it has $255 million in coverage of assets held in online, or hot, wallets, whereas the new Gemini policy is for cold storage. Other large crypto insurance offerings were previously reported by insurance brokerage Marsh’s Blue Vault, which provided $150 million for coins kept in cold storage. Gemini’s captive insurance company is dubbed “Nakamoto” after bitcoin’s mysterious creator, and licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). The Caribbean island is a popular location for insurance carriers, owing to its favorable regulatory environment, particularly when it comes to bespoke products and entities such as captives. To be clear: As a captive, Nakamoto will insure only Gemini clients, not competitors.Captive insurance subsidiaries, wholly owned by the firm being insured, have been around for a long time in the traditional corporate world and are a common cost-saving approach taken by Fortune 500 companies.When it comes to crypto, captives create a more formalized way of providing cover than self-insuring, which many large exchanges do by simply holding a big stash of bitcoin. The captive route is advantageous in this respect because it provides access to reinsurance markets (a form of insurance purchased by insurance companies to mitigate risk).“A captive really broadens Gemini’s access to reinsurance markets which is something they would not have had access to before,” said Sarah Downey, who co-leads the digital asset risk transfer team at Marsh, which, along with Aon, helped arrange the policy.  “So in a way, it gives them the opportunity to tap into more coverage and potentially a better rate.”Aon is acting as Gemini’s captive manager, while Marsh placed the excess coverage (cover against losses over and above that provided by the Nakamoto captive entity) through the direct insurance market.The excess coverage, for the most part, was placed through the Marsh Blue Vault facility and was led by the Lloyd's syndicate Arch Insurance International in the U.K., said Downey. Hussain said the way to think about this is a combination of captive and traditional insurance providing a total of $200 million.“The captive is the primary layer, and the traditional insurance markets are taking the excess layers – and then beyond that customers can procure additional insurance on a client-by-client basis,” he said.He would not disclose how much of that is being stumped up by Gemini itself in the form of the captive but said, “A majority of it is provided by traditional insurance markets.”The Nakamoto captive completes Gemini’s insurance triumvirate. Firstly, U.S. dollar customer deposits are eligible for FDIC insurance (placed at third-party banks including crypto-friendly Silvergate) and covered up to $250,000. The second part came with a SOC2 security audit carried out by Deloitte, which enabled Gemini to attain hot wallet cover for funds held on the exchange, a deal also brokered by Marsh. Hussain said Gemini managed to acquire coverage for its hot wallets back in 2018 – when underwriters had very little appetite for that kind of risk – because of the audit and the ability to show it had no single point of failure. Quizzed over the limits on offer for hot wallet cover, he said: “It has a different risk profile and our underwriters prevent us from disclosing the amount.""Some in the crypto space have suggested that operating a captive is really the same as self-insuring. However, Hussain said Gemini’s belt-and-braces approach to regulation (the exchange holds a Trust License from the New York Department of Financial Services) is carried on in the captive model, and that the two insurance approaches are “vastly different.""“The capital reserve requirements required by a regulated jurisdiction like Bermuda bring regulatory oversight to the captive,” he said. By contrast, “with self-insurance, an exchange can set aside $100 million and if things get tight, they can go ahead and repurpose that $100 million without notifying anybody and saying, ‘Hey, we need to go invest this elsewhere.’”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Feb 6, 2020 at 03:00 UTC",Germany’s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) is clarifying how the country’s new cryptocurrency custody law will apply to firms that operate outside of Germany but still serve the German market.,"In its latest guidance released in January, the regulator said firms already custodying digital assets for Germans would not be penalized for not having a license. Instead, they’d be grandfathered into the same protection that crypto custody firms based in Germany already have under the new law, which went into effect on Jan. 1. This means those firms must also announce their intent to apply for a license by March 31 and apply for the license by Nov. 30. It also means crypto firms that hadn't been custodying crypto for German customers before Jan. 1 but are interested in expanding into the German market cannot do so until they have received a license first. “Nobody has the ability to apply right away, which is why we have these grandfathering mechanisms,” said Carola Rathke, partner at Eversheds Sutherland Germany, a firm that is working directly with BaFin on how the law should be enforced.At the beginning of 2020, BaFin published an application form that is non-binding, meaning firms are not required to use the form. The most recent guidance also makes clear firms should be submitting a “complete application” by the Nov. 30 deadline – meaning the regulator has no questions about the application. Crypto firms should plan to apply long before the end of November, Rathke added. Germany drafted the law in response to the European Union’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5), which requires crypto firms to demonstrate compliance with enhanced know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) procedures. While firms familiar with German financial regulation are already drafting applications, the industry is at the mercy of whatever guidance BaFin releases over the next several months. The process may be jarring for firms that aren’t used to dealing with the German regulator. “This is exactly the way it works: They make a law quickly and then find out that it is not very clever, and now after the law is out they establish administrative practices,” said Sven Hildebrandt, head of Distributed Ledger Consulting Group, which has been advising crypto firms on how to navigate the complexities of the German regulatory system.“I believe there is enough guidance out there that if you know what you’re doing then you know what to do by now basically,” he added.Hildebrandt estimates that guidance will start to appear as the result of specific applications in the next three to five weeks. Hildebrant’s DLC Group is now trying to get approval from BaFin to serve as the compliance arm of companies that can’t afford to apply for the license themselves. Still, there are parts of crypto custody that aren’t addressed by the law – like custody that takes advantage of multi-party computation, Hildebrandt said. Certain parts of the law will also need clarity over time. For instance, firms applying must have a German branch with directors who are “fit and proper,” but defining what makes a manager in crypto right for the job could be difficult. It’s likely the regulator will require a manager with banking experience in addition to having a manager with technical blockchain experience, Rathke said.

Paul Veradittakit is a partner at Pantera Capital, focusing on venture capital and hedge fund investments. Pantera Capital is one of the earliest and largest institutional investors in digital currencies and blockchain technologies, managing over $500 million.","2019 has been an incredible year for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space – we’ve been through immense market fluctuations, regulatory battles and financial scandals, Senate hearings, and the launches of several key abstractions that enable some really interesting applications. We’ve got some high hopes for 2020 – the innovations we’ve seen in the last year enable a diversity of awesome use cases for crypto, highlight some critical areas for improvement, and represent a huge advancement in the technicality and complexity of the industry.A year ago, I made similar predictions for the direction of blockchain in 2019. Here’s a look back at how those performed throughout the year. I’ve rated the strength of my predictions on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least predictive and 5 being the most predictive of how the year actually went.2019 saw some significant acquisitions, many of which propelled the year’s most significant projects. Some ones to note are ConsenSys’s acquisition of Infura (an ETH node hosting service), Coinbase’s acquisition of Neutrino (crypto analytics), and Facebook’s acquisition of Chainspace (of which, presumably much of the talent contributed to Libra/Calibra).Accuracy: 4Institutionally, I saw a lot of crucial STO growth, including Blockstack, a $33.8 million Bond-i by the World Bank, a $20 million bond on ethereum by Santander, and a partnership with Asia’s largest real estate investment trust to launch Link REIT. Still, purchases were slow due to (1) persistent regulatory concerns and (2) little value-add beyond higher relative liquidity, which wasn’t enough to convert most investors to purchase STOs. The space is growing, but slowly. Accuracy: 3This turned out very true – ICO closures in 2019 were incredibly sparse compared to 2018 (August and October both had none, while January 2018 had 160 projects). That said, 2019 projects raised more funding on average ($6.8 million) compared to 2018 ($132,000). Still, ICOs are losing popularity because of (1) concerns with funded projects (2) regulatory hurdles with selling the tokens and (3) the crypto bear market.Accuracy: 5With higher education on cryptocurrency, 2019 did see more institutional interest and investment than prior years. There were projects like JPM Coin (by JPMorgan), the launch of Fidelity Digital Assets, and whispers of interest and proposed projects from other major institutions like Goldman Sachs and the World Bank. Still, we didn’t see a ton of tangible projects in this space, but as crypto matures, the traditional giants of the finance industry are becoming more and more interested. Accuracy: 2Scalability (primarily sharding and payment channels) was a huge thesis for 2019. The Lightning Network’s growth was one of the most critical vehicles for the wave of development of decentralized apps in 2019; developers are becoming less wary of blockchain’s high fees and low speed and are capitalizing on its other features, with similar convenience to traditional development platforms. In a similar vein, I also saw significant work in abstractions for developers, like the Alchemy API. Accuracy: 5For 2020, I’ve identified some key concepts and projects that I think will advance significantly. I’ve discussed my thoughts on each below.In 2019, Facebook announced its Libra project, a cryptocurrency that will be integrated with the Facebook suite of products (Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp) through a new platform called Calibra. Facebook expects the Calibra wallet to launch in 2020 for its messaging applications – this will likely be the largest mainstream launch and use case for cryptocurrency that the world has ever seen. Facebook’s user base is massive, to say the least, at 2.45 billion individuals, and Calibra will likely present an easy-to-use, convenient platform for these users to pay each other and pay online services through single-sign-on with their Facebook credentials. A launch at this scale would introduce millions of users (many of whom have little to no background with crypto) to the idea of managing assets and payments via a cryptocurrency – and will test the resolve of the space against the masses. It’s also likely that Libra and Calibra will open critical conversations on regulatory issues and data privacy; David Marcus, the head of the project, has already testified against the doubts of the US Senate and ongoing criticism of Facebook’s data scandals will highlight the power – and necessary improvements – of a platform like Libra/Calibra.The latter half of 2019 has not been kind to bitcoin – we hit a price maximum of roughly above $13,000 around the middle of the year but have since dropped back down to hovering around the $8,000 mark. Nonetheless, the price has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year. More importantly, in May 2020, bitcoin will undergo its next halving event; to put it succinctly, halving is a protocol built into bitcoin that “halves” the reward that miners receive for mining a block every few years, forcing the total amount of BTC to ever be in existence to cap at 21 million. The reward for mining a block will halve to 6.25 BTC (nearly $40,000 given the current price of BTC).Halving will likely create a significant bull run in the bitcoin market, for two main reasons. First, it perceptually represents a shrinking supply of “remaining BTC” for investors, which makes investors see each new unit of BTC with more and more value (since less remain). Secondly, since the mining reward is less, fewer miners will be incentivized to mine transactions – this relative scarcity of miners (compared to the status quo) will also drive up the value of the cryptocurrency. Halving will likely keep the price of BTC relatively high for the entirety of 2020 and may bring some more confidence to the space.Game developers and enthusiasts are increasingly exploring what blockchain can do for their gaming systems and how they can incorporate cryptographic assets into (1) the way they provision technological resources and (2) gameplay, in terms of in-game purchases, assets for different players, credits, etc. We’ve seen a fair amount of this already – Splinterland on Steem and the collaboration between Enjin and Microsoft Azure Heroes, but still, there’s a lot of work that remains. Blockchain gaming will likely boom in 2020 because of important developments in high-performance tools that allow games to run on previously-rate-limiting blockchain technologies, better architected smart contracts, second-layer solutions, and abstracted infrastructure/digital asset storage that makes it easy for game developers to build digital assets into the gameplay and character experience. Hopefully, we’ll see something mainstream on a platform like Steam or Twitch that really puts the power of blockchain in the context of the average gamer.Decentralized finance (DeFi) has undoubtedly been one of the largest areas for growth of cryptocurrency in 2019 – and I expect that this trend will follow through with 2020. Services like Maker, Compound, InstaDapp, etc. will likely see more monthly active users and locked-in value as more and more mainstream consumers and crypto enthusiasts alike catch onto the real-world potential of DeFi – for lending, taking out a mortgage, retail payments, arbitrage, etc. DAI is also increasingly becoming the “stablecoin standard” and a strong performance in 2019 sets high hopes for its potential growth in 2020 across mainstream users. With the move from single-collateralized DAI to multi-collateralized DAI earlier this year, we’re also likely going to see an onboarding of more users onto the platform and a diversification of the collateral behind DAI, both of which provide critical strength to DAI as a stablecoin and its signaling about the blockchain space. We’ve also seen growing institutional interest in blockchain from the likes of consumer finance products and major banks – we’re keen to see more of this growth in 2020.This is unlikely to happen within the United States, but China earlier this year launched a digitized version of their yuan currency for mainstream use in a diversity of applications – loans, retail, taxes, etc. This digital currency isn’t strictly a “cryptocurrency” per se, because it’s delivered through a centralized agency, but it does represent growing global interest into shifting the financial ecosystem online. This digital yuan will be a promising signal as to how digital assets perform in mainstream use cases, particularly in online venues like Alibaba and Baidu. Strong outcomes may signal higher confidence in digitizing the financial space, which ultimately brings more confidence to cryptocurrency and DeFi.The past year has also been huge for infrastructural solutions for blockchain – some key ones include the growth of the Lightning Network, which provides critical speed and scalability improvements for decentralized apps, and Alchemy, which offers a suite of APIs and infrastructural tools that greatly simplify the decentralized development process. These advancements will likely spur a wave of new decentralized applications and web 3.0 technologies, enabled by abstractions and enhanced simplicity of development. We’re hoping to see more decentralized compute platforms (in the likes of Orchid, a VPN provisioning solution that capitalizes on a decentralized digital token system), that may also capitalize on increasing growth in cloud and SaaS technologies next year. This will likely broaden to other, more consumer-oriented use cases too, like privacy-centric browsers, gaming, social networks, information retrieval, and more.With the diversity of crypto projects that have launched in 2019 and those to come in 2020, it would be naïve to not anticipate the regulatory hurdles that come with these nascent technologies. Some key ones to watch out for include (1) regulation of technologies that employ zero-knowledge proofs (Zcash, for example) that might present powerful, unregulatable tools for criminal financial use, (2) data privacy concerns with the mainstreaming of blockchain and electronic digital finance (concerns surrounding the Libra launch, for example), and (3) the ongoing fight about recognizing certain tokens and currencies and securities versus commodities. As crypto projects become increasingly nuanced and different in highly-specified ways, we’re also hoping to see greater education about these projects amongst regulatory agencies to understand the nuances and how they might affect their regulation and characterization.Ultimately, with a space as nascent as cryptocurrency, it’s hard to identify exactly what might be big in the coming year – projects go through extremes of success and failures, currencies go through peaks and plateaus, and the industry goes through intense controversy and spells of confidence. That said, I’m confident that 2020 will be a significant year for the industry and we’ll see some incredible innovations.

Yet, in the white-hot cryptocurrency industry, lenders are burgeoning.","The Commerce Department reported Thursday that U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.1 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, on par with the third quarter’s clip, even after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times earlier in 2019 to stimulate growth. For the full year, the economy expanded 2.3 percent, a slowdown from 2018's 2.9 percent, according to the report.If there's any softening in the economy, it hasn't been felt by lenders like Genesis. The New York-based trading firm that lends cash alongside cryptocurrencies like bitcoin said Thursday in a report that loans increased by 21 percent during the fourth quarter to $545 million, driven by demand from big investors as well as aggregators of smaller loans in Asia and Europe.       Such growth was more than 10 times the pace at New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, where loan balances increased by 2 percent - roughly the same pace as the economy - during the period to $959.8 billion.Only a few lenders can be found in the decade-old digital asset industry, and they are starting from a smaller base. There’s also a dearth of competition from established banks for loans to crypto traders and businesses, due to conservative risk-management policies and restrictions imposed by regulators. Since a cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be a highly volatile collateral for loans, more traditional lenders are rare. But crypto lenders are seeing strong demand from borrowers who want loans denominated in bitcoin, cash or “stablecoins” - digital tokens like tether and USD Coin whose price is linked to the U.S. dollar or other government-issued currencies. And there are plenty of investors willing to pledge cash to lenders like Genesis in exchange for interest rates of 7 or 8 percent. BlockFi, a big crypto lender backed by the investment funds Galaxy Digital and Winklevoss Capital, said earlier this month it planned to add five to 10 new assets to its platform, including the cryptocurrency litecoin and a dollar-pegged digital token, USD Coin. Later this year BlockFi plans to launch a credit card that offers rewards in bitcoin.Celsius Network, another crypto lender, said in December large institutional clients were becoming an increasingly key contributor to the platform’s loan growth.    “Obviously the crypto sector is not even a beauty mark right now compared with the banking sector, in terms of the size and maturity,” Genesis CEO Michael Moro said in a phone interview. “But there is rapid growth in this new market, and it’s not just us. There are other companies trying to accomplish similar things.”Genesis is controlled by the crypto-focused investment firm Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk. Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, surged 94 percent in 2019, more than three times the gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks over the period. So far in January, bitcoin is up another 30 percent to about $9,300, the best start to a year since 2013. Earlier this month, the professional-network website LinkedIn named blockchain - the cryptographically-enabled computer-network technology underpinning cryptocurrencies - as the most in-demand skill among employers.Silvergate Capital, one of the few banking companies serving crypto-related businesses, said Wednesday total assets were flat in the fourth quarter at $2.13 billion. But the La Jolla, California-based publicly traded company said it added 48 digital currency customers during the period, bringing the total to 804, while transactions on its digital Silvergate Exchange Network rose by 17 percent from third-quarter levels. A recently announced initiative at Silvergate will allow customers to obtain U.S. dollar-denominated loans collateralized by bitcoin. Genesis said in its latest report a new source of demand for cash loans in 2020 could come from ""mining"" companies that need capital to build, expand or upgrade data centers used to process transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.“We will likely see miners leverage their existing balance sheet and treasury to source the cash necessary to invest in their operation,” according to the report. “Those unable to source cash will be stuck mining on old-generation machines and might face serious profitability issues if the price of bitcoin doesn’t rise substantially.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It was the company's first official earnings call as a publicly-traded company and revealed the ups and downs of serving the crypto sector.Silvergate's earnings report lists a 4 percent decrease in deposits from the digital currency industry despite the addition of 48 crypto clients. The commercial bank’s overall deposits decreased by 1.8 percent in the same quarter (Silvergate also serves non-crypto businesses). Around 74 percent of the bank’s $1.8 billion deposits were non-interest bearing.Deposits lagged most among institutional investors who have less interest in trading while bitcoin is in a bear market and doesn’t have a lot of daily volatility.“We don’t pay interest on these deposits, so we experience outflows during times when the opportunity to make outsized returns on trading declines a bit,” Silvergate CEO Alan Lane said in an earnings call Wednesday morning. “That’s why we focus on just continuing to add customers, knowing that when the market comes back and they want to trade their assets, the best way to do that is by putting deposits at Silvergate.”Lane attributed the new client growth to the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which allows commercial customers to instantly move U.S. dollars between different crypto exchanges. SEN transactions topped 14,400 in the fourth quarter, a 17 percent increase from Q3 2019. This is the highest that SEN transactions have ever been, despite the daily average price of bitcoin declining from Q3 to Q4, Ben Reynolds, Silvergate’s director of corporate development said. The cost of deposits for the bank, which holds $2.1 billion in assets, increased from 0.5 percent to 0.84 percent. For scale, average deposit costs for small mid-cap commercial banks are normally around 0.75 to 1.25 percent, said KBW analyst Mike Perito.Silvergate earned $1.4 million in fee income from its crypto customers, down 12.5 percent from $1.6 million last quarter because of a lag in foreign exchange fees. The bank’s fee income is mostly made up of foreign exchange transactions, cash management products such as wires and ACH and send fees for digital currency clients. The bank added 11 digital currency exchanges (including over-the-counter trading desks), 21 institutional investors and 16 crypto businesses (i.e. mining operations or crypto application companies). Lane noted in the call that there are more than 200 future crypto customers in the bank’s review and onboarding pipeline.Silvergate’s net income decreased by around 45 percent, from $6.6 million in the third quarter to $3.6 million. It’s net interest margin also dropped from 3.39 percent to 2.97 percent quarter-over-quarter. The bank’s largest expenses came from salaries and employee benefits, which increased in the fourth quarter by nearly 6 percent to $8.7 million. In response to analysts questions, Lane said that the bank has yet to make a strong correlation between the price or volatility of bitcoin and deposit levels. “Other banks have mentioned their intention to come into the space and are offering customers some yield,” Lane said. Metropolitan Commercial Bank in New York seems to have felt the same pressure of new crypto banking entrants, with its deposits dropping by half over the course of 2019.In 2013, Silvergate pivoted from traditional commercial banking to serving the cryptocurrency community as a rich resource of non-interest bearing deposits. The bank then converts these deposits into interest-bearing deposits at other banks, investment securities and loans. Earlier this month, Silvergate launched the SEN Leverage product in pilot mode, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans that they can then use to buy more bitcoin, similar to margin lending in the traditional markets.When analysts inquired about the cost of underwriting SEN Leverage loans because of the volatility of the underlying collateral asset, Lane said the institutional investors that will be using the product can add more USD as collateral or pay down the loan at any time through the SEN network. “The institutional investor has more access to funds,” KBW’s Perito said. “For example, a hedge fund client of Silvergate might only be putting 15 percent of their cash into the digital currency niche and 85 percent of their money in other areas. They have access to cash much more than retail investors buying bitcoin with their savings account money.”Silvergate also made its first hire directly from the crypto industry, bringing on former Blockstream exec Benjamin Richman as director of digital currency.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""It's helping to legitimize [digital assets], in my view, and add liquidity to these markets."" The marketplace for cryptocurrencies derivatives is expanding. Although still dominated by unregulated exchanges, it is gradually facing greater competition from regulated alternatives. Bakkt launched physically delivered bitcoin futures last September and CME, which first launched bitcoin futures in December 2017, opened trading for options contracts Monday. In the interview, Tarbert reiterated that his perspective will only extend to cryptocurrencies the CFTC currently classifies as commodities. Appointed chairman last April, he has advocated for an open regulatory regime when it comes to cryptocurrencies.In an op-ed published on the CFTC website November, Tarbert argued regulators should adopt a greater ""principles-based approach"" to the asset class. ""The trick with digital assets is to foster the development of exciting new products while mitigating potential risks,"" he wrote. Rather than the regulator issuing prescriptive rules that companies need to follow, companies should develop commercially viable solutions that satisfy regulatory standards, he said. The CFTC first defined bitcoin as a commodity in 2015, confirming the classification when it gave the go-ahead to CME and Cboe to launch regulated futures at the close of 2017. Ether was only confirmed as a commodity last October when Tarbert said that, as it hadn't been treated as a security by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ""it stands to reason"" that it is most likely a commodity. When asked by Cheddar whether any other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, could soon be defined as commodities, Tarbert told investors ""to watch this space"" as the CFTC works closely with the SEC to ""really think about which [crypto] falls in what box.""

Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who announced the settlement Monday, have already won 11,325 BTC from this previous case. The plaintiffs created a webpage for potential Cryptsy victims – any individuals who used the exchange before 2015 – listing upcoming key dates and outlining how they can submit claims. The settlement concludes a three-year legal action that nearly saw a jury trial.A hearing will be held on April 17, 2020, to either approve the preliminary settlement agreement or add further modifications as needed, according to the filing.Brandon Leidel, designated the class representative in the class action lawsuit, will receive $2,500 due to his efforts. He brought the suit in 2016 alleging Cryptsy CEO Paul Vernon used the exchange to launder millions of dollars' worth of user funds over a multi-year period. The case was originally filed by the Silver Miller law firm and Wites Law Firm, both of which were designated class counsel. In a statement, attorney Marc Wites said the case against Coinbase, as well as the previous lawsuit filed against Cryptsy, ""were difficult cases"" to resolve. ""When companies go out of business, founders flee the country and the amount at issue is relatively small, most plaintiff law firms would decline to pursue the case,"" he said. ""We were the only lawyers in the country to pursue a case against Cryptsy or Coinbase, individually or as a class action, and we were able to obtain multiple meaningful recoveries for victims who would have otherwise been left without any recourse.""David Silver of Silver Miller said he commended Coinbase ""for stepping up and resolving"" the case. The Cryptsy case shows how early exchanges, ""especially unregulated exchanges like Cryptsy, shunned regulators, laws and ultimately stole from its own clientele,"" he said.""This case shows that businesses in the cryptosphere bear a large measure of responsibility, from with whom they decide to do business and with whom they choose to associate,"" he said.

The London-based subsidiary currently offers bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and XRP futures contracts and sees some $48 million in average daily volume for the bitcoin futures. The company saw $17 million in volume on Monday.“Russia is the most under-appreciated market in crypto today,” said Kevin Beardsley, head of business development at Kraken Futures. Beardsley believes the abundance of tech talent, especially in crypto, makes Russia an attractive market.“The conversation is dominated by the U.S. and China, probably a bit less Japan and Korea,"" he said. ""Even [though] Russia is objectively a leader in the infrastructure building and has a large community, it gets relatively little coverage,.""As two examples, Beardsley cited Telegram and TradingView, which have teams predominantly from Russia and surrounding nations.Bragin started in November 2019, the company announced last month (Beardsley said the post was published on Dec. 24 but backdated to November). He comes with experience in the industry, having founded peer-to-peer crypto futures exchange ICBIT back in 2011. That was acquired by Swedish crypto exchange Safello in 2016.“Russian traders increasingly consider cryptocurrency to be just another asset class, alongside commodities and currencies,” Bragin told CoinDesk. “The rapidly growing number of individual traders, combined with the increasing acceptance of trading cryptocurrency, represent clear, positive signals for the growth cryptocurrency futures trading in Russia.”He added that even though derivatives market at large in Russia is still very young, it’s already “developed into one of the most important markets.” “Cryptocurrency derivatives started attracting traders from the classic futures market in 2018, it grew in 2019 and trading experts expect the trend to continue in 2020,” Bragin said.  The Russian expansion for Kraken will not involve spot trading or see any fiat on-ramps for the Russian ruble. Crypto-to crypto futures trading is the safest way to enter the market, Beardsley said, as it presents “a relatively low risk of [the exchange being used for] money laundering.”So far, few global exchanges have paid special attention to Russia, among them Huobi, which opened an office in Moscow in November 2018, Binance, which launched a fiat on-ramp for the Russian ruble earlier this year. Russians are trading crypto derivatives quite actively, according to the Yakov Barinsky, CEO of HASH CIB, a crypto asset management firm that actively trades derivatives itself. Barinsky said between 10 percent and 15 percent of the trading volume on the most popular crypto derivatives exchanges like BitMEX, Deribit and Kraken comes from Russian traders, most of whom are professionals.Russian traders might be bringing in from $4 million of trades on Kraken to some $230 million on BitMEX in bitcoin futures trade. As such, Kraken will face some serious competition in Russia, Barinsky said, adding, “After Binance Futures was launched, liquidity started moving to it and we expect that it’s going to exceed others by trading volume this year.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Crypto Davos grew mainly by group chats and word of mouth. However ...","Jan 14, 2020 at 17:30 UTC","This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.","Sandra Ro is the CEO
of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), which is organizing the
four-day Blockchain
Central Davos event.The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), renowned
as a place where business executives, government officials, entrepreneurs and
NGO leaders convene to create positive change, is days away. In recent years the WEF Meeting has come under fire as a place where wealthy elites gather to discuss solutions to problems they helped create and perpetuate – problems many blockchain startups are working to solve. But the reality of Davos lies somewhere between these two extremes. So why engage? Why do we keep going back?2020 is special: It’s the 50th anniversary of the WEF, a non-profit foundation created in 1971 to engage society’s foremost political, business and cultural leaders to shape global, regional and industry agendas.This year’s WEF theme is “Stakeholders for a Cohesive and
Sustainable World.” Some of the broad questions to be asked: What does “stakeholder
capitalism” mean? Is it tracking progress towards the Paris Agreement and the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? How does technology fit in? “With the world at such critical crossroads, this year we
must develop a ‘Davos Manifesto 2020’ to reimagine the purpose and scorecards
for companies and governments,” said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive
chairman of the WEF.If the world is at a crossroads, what is the role of cryptocurrencies,
digital assets and blockchain? And who gets to shape and influence this future?
In short, should “Crypto Davos” collaborate with the
established elites? Crypto pioneers set up shop with Davos side events four or
five years ago. These were modest gatherings to discuss the future of
cryptocurrencies. Very few elites knew what this was, or paid it much attention.
  Just as bitcoin and ethereum began as organic grassroots
initiatives, Crypto Davos grew mainly by group chats and word of mouth.
However, by 2018, Crypto Davos reached peak excess, coinciding with the boom of
ICOs. This was followed by muted numbers in 2019 with the bust, and now, in
2020, a mix of Crypto Davos stalwarts are returning alongside mainstream
corporations that are ahead of the curve in embracing blockchain and,
sometimes, cryptocurrency. (Unfortunately, the mantra of “blockchain good,
crypto bad” lingers in certain corporate and government circles, though it is
dissipating over time.)What happens at WEF’s official gathering is important, but
most who have attended Davos previously know that “the Promenade” is a beehive
of activity around cryptocurrencies, blockchain, AI, cybersecurity and other
emerging technologies. Many crypto people who attend Davos never step foot
inside the main event and do not hold a coveted “white badge.” Instead, they
hang out on the Promenade and participate in a myriad of panels, networking
events and meetings, mixed with late-night partying and bonding. The Promenade blockchain events are in high demand and
considered cutting edge, thereby attracting some high-profile leaders who might
seem out of place under normal, stodgier circumstances. Seeing rock stars,
actors, CEOs, billionaires, social-impact entrepreneurs and developers together
is not unusual at Crypto Davos. Where else do you see both Jamie Dimon and Jamie Oliver
walking down the same block within meters of each other? Or Michael Douglas
walking into an MIT-hosted lunch on AI and blockchain? (Seriously, that
happened back in 2017.)So why did a bunch of crypto people start coming to Davos in
the first place? Switzerland’s crypto-friendly environment partially explains
the attraction.But the secret sauce of Davos is not just about discussing
important ideas. Once you make it to this normally sleepy town, you are
jumbled together with 30,000 influential people on a few blocks of a “main
street.” It makes for an intense and rewarding four days of networking and
deal-making, which sets the tone for the rest of the year. Crypto Davos, despite its outsider status, has influenced and
changed the course of mainstream Davos. Just look at 2020’s big thematic on “stakeholders in a
cohesive and sustainable world,” which covers everything from economics to
climate change to technology, and includes topics like digital identity,
digital asset regulation and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In 2020, many, if not most, corporations participating at
Davos have internal blockchain projects and/or are members of digital asset
groups. Five years ago, the CEOs of these same corporations probably did not
know blockchain existed.Crypto Davos has profoundly influenced the interest and
growth of digital assets and blockchain technology among some of the most elite
institutions, governments and world leaders. Not bad for a bunch of outsiders.To the cynics and anti-establishment crowd, we debate every
year why we pay exorbitant rates to put together an event at Davos. The high costs,
occasionally not-so-subtle hostility from the mainstream, increasingly strict
town council rules and the general logistics nightmare are enough to deter
most. However, we return, because our supporters love attending.
Why? Because we have met some of the most awe-inspiring people at Davos, from
rocket scientists to world leaders to humanitarians.With a combination of bright, motivated people, ideas turn
into action here: from investments to business deals to project launches. No
matter how great the tech, we are humans who make connections by meeting each
other, spending time with each other and, ultimately, collaborating with each
other.  The key for Crypto Davos is to keep influencing and building bridges with the establishment to yield the societal change we want. Blockchain works best when it’s collaborative. The same holds true at Davos: Crypto Davos can improve and scale with the resources of large institutions; Establishment Davos can reimagine business models and government services to create a more equitable and functional society.This grand experiment works best if people collaborate
across geographies and disciplines.

It's also expanding trading hours to 24/7. The new order books were launched in response to demand from Seed’s European traders, said Brian Liston, president of the spot market division. “We have a lot of traders who are in Europe and Asia and we wanted to cater to those clients and make it extremely relevant,” he told CoinDesk. “People who are predominantly focused on euro books like our liquidity, our prices, our infrastructure but they just want to trade these order books.”The company will now focus on building volume for the new books, which have already been live for a week. Further down the line, Liston envisions adding yen-denominated pairs – including an order book for YEN/USD.“That creates an interesting strategy because not many places offer FX [foreign exchange] in more than one denominated book,” he said. While Seed CX’s spot trading business is expanding, its previous plans to launch its own derivatives products may be on hold.According to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission’s list of Swap Execution Facilities, Seed CX’s SEF registration went dormant in September 2019. An SEF registration allows companies in the U.S. to trade derivatives products. A CFTC fact sheet said SEFs are considered dormant if they have traded any derivatives in the past 12 months, and have been in operation for at least three years. Seed CX received its SEF in August 2016. It can reinstate the registration by filing documents with the CFTC.Seed decided to focus on its spot trading and settlement due to the large number of derivatives exchanges currently in the market, according to Liston. Seed Digital Commodities settles through Zero Hash, Seed CX’s subsidiary focused on custody and settlement. Zero Hash can support most currencies used in G20 nations, and would be able to add new order books quickly if there is sufficient demand, he said.“We still have a good relationship with the CFTC and are keeping our options open,” Liston said. “However, we’re focusing almost all of our effort on the digital commodities market.”The firm’s new 24/7 operations also come in response to existing demand, he said. “What we’ve just done is launch trading over the weekend and a lot of crypto is 24/7 but our exchange was five days a week,” he said. “A lot of it was settlement [and] working with banks.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Richie Hecker is an entrepreneur, and management consultant at Traction & Scale. ","2019 was the year of Libra rising – an attempt led by Facebook to create a new form of digital currency and banking system. Transformative in potential and huge in aspirations, Libra was the seminal crypto event of 2019. Yet, like most of the ICOs that predated it, Libra is doomed to fail in its current form. There, I said it. Yes, I’m a big believer in the transformative power of technology for the underbanked to make it easier to save money and build credit. Unfortunately, Libra in its current form is not the solution because it offers an overcomplicated approach that will make it extremely difficult to execute. For background on where I am coming from,  I have run a community with 100 million users and spent many years in financial services including working on bank acquisitions.   Facebook could create a global payments network, which can benefit users around the world. With its billions of users and experience with scaling systems, Facebook already has the basic infrastructure in place to create a transformative payments system. If you add in all of the partners lined up as shareholders of Libra, it covers the gamut of global payments and commerce and should be able to succeed. This opportunity exists because the current banking system is closed. There are a host of regulatory licenses needed to hold, send and store money. Regulatory scrutiny is meant to ensure safety and security, to protect citizens from fraud and to prevent money laundering. But too often these controls kill competition and raise prices, leaving room for improvement in the system.Often, consumers cannot send wires on weekends and it can take days for global payments to clear between banks. The banks themselves are developing a real-time commercial payments platforms but they are not quite there yet. Banks have Zelle for real-time peer-to-peer payments and it works well, but you need to be a bank to use it. PayPal has Venmo, which works for individuals. The banks also have a B2B RTP network through The Clearing House that is live. It is nascent but it exists and the Federal Reserve is also developing its own real-time payments network called Fed Now for 24/7/365 payments. This will eventually come to life. This may make it difficult for a startup to compete long term.So what is Libra and why is it doomed to fail?Libra creates a digital token representing a basket of assets and a payment system designed to make it easy to send money around the world. According to the white paper, “Libra’s mission is to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people.” In a way, it is Venmo with its own currency running on a new real-time payment system. This payment system would be open 24/7, as opposed to the current banking system that is only partially 24/7 – those connected with Zelle and RTP. Libra creates a phantom payment network on top of existing currencies. The phantom currency represents traditional assets like dollars and transfers instantly, and then the actual assets can settle later. Libra says it will be backed by a basket of assets, but is not clear on exactly what assets will be inside of a Libra. This lack of clarity over what assets it will comprise will likely lead to regulatory jurisdiction vs jurisdiction hell. Every regulator touched by Libra will begin investigating it. It is not clear if it is a currency, a derivative, a security, a commodity pool, and so on. Thus, it isn’t clear which laws apply. Jurisdictions will likely disagree with each other on this point, as they do already in defining digital currencies at home. Nation-states could easily fight over the aspects over digital money, as there  does not appear to be any enacted international trade agreements that govern this type of financial arrangement. Even after Libra works out its legal jurisdiction, it will still be very hard to create the desired benefits for its stated use-cases. Libra’s stated goal is to provide digital banking for the 1.7 billion unbanked; provide a way for people in volatile markets to hold a stable asset; and offer a cheap way to exchange money worldwide. But these benefits will be extremely difficult to achieve.  Many of these issues can be addressed by learning one big lesson from the father of payments networks – Visa.In Libra’s proposed system, banking the unbanked will still require full due diligence and adhering to “Know Your Customer” regulations to combat money laundering, which could result in that signing up for Libra will be similar to dealing with any bank today with similar challenges. The on/off ramps are different but the regulations are similar. The expensive part of instituting a currency exchange is the “last mile,” which Libra cannot solve without building its own in-person network or partnering with existing retail and ATM networks. M-PESA, the East African mobile money transfer system regarded as a top system addressing the underbanked, partners with Western Union and other incumbent networks, so users can make it easier to send and receive money. M-PESA has 28 million active customers and facilitates 50 pertcent of Kenya GDP. M-PESA’s customers will now be able to send money to anyone in the 200 countries in which Western Union operates. Libra could set up similar partnerships to withdraw cash, or enable digital transfers and simply do it at a lower cost, by introducing itself as competition. In some countries, replicating local withdrawal networks will prove challenging. The cell networks are the key gatekeepers for mobile money in the developing world. It will be hard to compete with the carriers that have an existing most and user trust. However, a new offering could lead to a price war that could help customers or to Libra taking losses to subsidize growth. This is the equivalent of Western Union lowering its fees to add more value back to its customers. This could be greatly add value.The real cost of sending a payment is low and the cost of wholesale currency conversion is low so it is possible to do lower cost payments. If Facebook can create an internally coherent payments and consumer ecosystem, it will incur fewer on/off ramp costs. The big opportunity for Libra, aside from developing a wallet, is working with retailers and others to sell consumers products based on their net worth and spending habits. This it can do with the in-network money without worrying about consumers breaking back to fiat.  Most countries with volatile currencies have currency controls, which they will place on Libra, essentially making it money laundering to create an inflation hedge. For example, a government could make it illegal to buy or transfer more than a government-mandated threshold of Libra each year, and therefore converting out of the local currency would be a crime. Chinese nationals are able to transfer up to only $50,000 per person per year out of the country. China could easily pass a law to say any financial asset or cryptocurrency would fall under the rule as well. Even if Libra figures out a way to launch and achieve its stated goals, it will likely be crushed by fraud. Libra does not have a clear policy and process for fraud prevention engine or a simple mechanism to solve fraud disputes. Essentially, it creates a wild west free for all. So the lack of fraud controls will likely lead to a bad actor immediately creating an app to defraud people into sending their Libra to the scammer. Mobile bankers in Kenya sometimes keep all of their savings on their phone and routinely get scammed into giving up their passwords. Libra has great promise but has serious challenges to overcome. Many of these issues can be addressed by learning one big lesson from the father of payments networks – Visa. Visa started as Bank Americard, inside Bank of America, as an internal credit system. Then it became a system licensed to other banks and finally an association owned by its members and a public company. This staging approach allowed it to grow steadily and avoid undue regulatory and political burdens until it was ready to take over. Follow the same path of Visa. One, back Libra initially with only U.S. dollars or another single currency. This will enable Libra to launch within the current U.S. banking regulatory framework. If it launches inside the U.S. banking system, it will be respected everywhere, with the possible exception of China. There are clear ways to set this up, so it would pass all regulatory scrutiny. By including other assets, Libra brings a host of potential regulatory conflicts on itself, so even if it wins regulatory approval, that approval will be expensive and time consuming.  Two, the network should centralize administration so there is an anti-fraud system in place and a clear body to communicate with for regulatory scrutiny. What Libra proposed is essentially centralized anyway, with a single database to run the system.  Facebook has such a large network that implementing a low-fee payment system would be a huge first step. It can invite others onto the platform and finally turn it into a consortium once the bugs are removed and it has passed regulatory scrutiny. In fact, Facebook already has the infrastructure for this – payments inside of Messenger. It already has an anti-fraud system and it is tied to your Facebook ID. Three, after that, Facebook can enable people to build applications on top of the existing payments system. This step likely won’t require much additional regulatory requirements. Facebook mastered apps many years ago. These steps, implemented properly, will make it easy for Libra to launch and avoid being shut down by regulators. The cost of these steps will be steep. They would require almost total centralization and be a continuation of their existing business. But the benefit could be fast, fair global banking. A friend of mine once said, “Bring me a small island before you promise me the world.” A simpler staged approach can help Libra prosper – and deliver.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

papers written about it. So the trick with designing these systems ...","Jan 8, 2020 at 09:00 UTC","A recent academic study says Tezos is threatened by ""selfish mining,"" providing a valid attack model for other live and up-and-coming proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies.","That’s the finding from Selfish Behavior in the Tezos Proof-of-Stake Protocol, published last November by then-Harvard researcher and current Google engineering intern Michael Neuder.The paper from Neuder and other Harvard researchers shows the profitability – albeit small – of “selfish endorsing” attacks in Tezos, a variant of selfish mining. Luckily for Tezos, the selfish mining concern can easily be patched through the network’s flexible on-chain governance model, which conducts periodic votes for protocol changes in lieu of hard or soft forks.“It was a great research paper and we’d love to see more focus on economic and complex-system-interactions in cryptocurrency systems in academic and industrial research,” Tezos Foundation Chief Security Officer Ryan Lackey told CoinDesk in an email. “Thanks to our governance model, it’s pretty easy to get [the fix] adopted.”However, the ability to address governance issues quickly raises questions concerning possible trade-offs involved with on-chain governance, how voting works and the possible outcomes of staking centralization.As described and proven by the researchers, a Tezos baker (the blockchain’s term for “miner”) can be rationally incentivized to create their own blocks and receive endorsements from other bakers not connected to the main chain, creating a secondary invalid chain.Through the attack, the initial baker gains both the block and endorsement reward for the invalid block and can continue the attack until detected. If exposed, the baker’s stake is ""slashed,"" punishing the baker for dishonest mining.In Tezos, stakers gain fractions of a block reward for endorsing the creation of a new block, which packages network transactions. Selfish mining occurs in Nakamoto-style consensus mechanisms, like Tezos, which follow the longest chain rule. Under the rule, the longest chain, containing the most work, is generally considered the correct pathway by network participants.The attack is far from lucrative, however, for two reasons.The net payout of an attack is insignificant – a mere 255 XTZ ($336 at today’s prices) for staking 40 percent of the network's outstanding supply in one year. It’s also highly costly if detected: Validators can have their stake in the network taken away if dishonesty is detected. Still, according to Messari research analyst Wilson Withiam, the study exposes understudied aspects of PoS.“It goes to show how little we know about PoS mechanisms, let alone one in a working environment,” Withiam told CoinDesk. “As the less understood consensus mechanism next to Proof-of-Work, most PoS attack vectors may remain unknown, and code changes like those implemented via [Tezos governance update] Babylon could continue to unveil new vulnerabilities on live networks.”Withiam said that with more PoS network’s launching in the near future, such as Eth 2.0 and Libra, understanding selfish-mining attacks remains “vital.”The attack may be unlikely due to the high costs, but Tezos is still taking the issue seriously. An ongoing election is expected to pass a network upgrade altering endorsement incentives, according to Adrian Brink of Tezos blockchain research firm Cryptium Labs.“It’s important to understand that most of these attacks (like selfish baking) are not short-term dangers but rather long-term dangers, since they are obvious if executed and only start to have a serious impact if executed over months to years,” Brink said via email.The incident highlights Tezos’ on-chain governance, a unique feature among current blockchain protocols.For selfish mining, Brink said changing incentives to decrease the likelihood of attacks is the goal.“[The update] hardens the security model in order to make more likely attacks (such as the selfish baking attack) unprofitable for attackers unless they acquire a very large percentage of the stake,” said Brink.Even with all the fancy coding, developing a holistic system remains difficult, said Brink.“Generally it’s impossible to build a security model which is secure against everything,” he said. “Bitcoin’s mining model has many weaknesses and there have been countless papers written about it. So the trick with designing these systems is to make the right trade-offs.”Network attack vectors such as selfish mining highlight Tezos’ on-chain governance and the ability to address headaches before they become migraines. Yet, compared to other chains, Tezos has taken the unexplored path when it comes to large-cap coins requiring censorship-resistance and stability. For Tezos, the mounting centralization of staking on exchanges could have many unknown consequences.As data firm Coinmetrics pointed out, the number of addresses staking 0.1 XTZ or more on Coinbase jumped 30 percent in one month following the exchange’s “free staking” announcement. What are the possible outcomes for mass staking on publicly identifiable – and therefore censorship prone – exchanges?“Staking with coins held on an exchange is simpler than delegating or staking directly,” said Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter. “It's not surprising to me. Exchanges are kind of neo-banks serving the crypto community.” (Carter holds investments in XTZ.)Carter said voting-based systems such as PoS require “a robust civil society.” In other words, information and participation are worth their weight in gold for these protocols.“I think Tezos has done well in that respect,” Carter said. “They have high participation and generally an eagerness on the part of token holders to participate. Whether this impairs the censor resistance of the protocol – that's an interesting question we will grapple with soon, I believe.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 6, 2020 at 16:58 UTC","Telegram will not integrate a crypto wallet into its messaging app, at least until it gets the green light from U.S. regulators, the company said Monday on its official website. The announcement comes ahead of Telegram’s CEO deposition in Dubai on Tuesday. ","The post, which appears to be the first official notice addressing the TON blockchain project, is signed by “The Telegram Team” and describes the relationship between Telegram and TON.“In light of recent events, we wanted to take the time to publicly clarify certain aspects of the TON Blockchain and Grams as we continue to prepare for a successful launch of the project,” the post reads, apparently referring to the lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) brought against Telegram in October. The statement purports to detail Telegram's dedication to legal compliance, even as the company fights the SEC on claims that it intended to flood U.S. capital markets with unregistered securities.“Grams are NOT investment products and there should be NO expectation of future profit or gain from the purchase, sale or holding of Grams,” the notice reads, adding that the tokens don’t represent equity in Telegram, dividend rights or governance rights in Telegram “and its affiliates,”  although it’s not specified what entities are meant by this term. “Grams won't help you get rich,” the post says. More significantly, Telegram changed its plans to make grams readily available to all Telegram users. According to the new notice, the wallet for the tokens will only be available as a stand-alone app, which has been recently released in beta.  In October, Telegram published its Terms of Service for the wallet, saying Gram Wallet would be integrated into the messenger in addition to the standalone product at the time.“Telegram may integrate the TON Wallet application with the Telegram Messenger service in the future to the extent permitted under applicable laws and governmental authorities,” the posts says, seemingly indicating that for now, users will only be able to use the standalone product.Telegram's post also addresses its past lack of comment on the TON project.Telegram “has been careful not to speak publicly” about the project, which raised $1.7 billion in a closed and secretive token pre-sale in 2018, “to ensure that the TON Blockchain and Grams can operate in a way that is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations,” the post explains. The team confirmed Telegram had been working on the TON blockchain and gram cryptocurrency since 2017, according to the post.""We hope that as a result of this project Grams will become a true complement to traditional currencies, improving the speed, efficiency and security of everyday commercial transactions globally,” the post reads.Perhaps to make up for this past reticence, Telegram's blog post insists TON will be a decentralized network, which the company may not ""develop any applications or features for ... or otherwise contribute [to] in any way"" once the network is live.Telegram’s employees also won’t use their own grams to participate in transaction validation and on-chain voting, the post says.“This voluntary decision was made in order to avoid any perception that Telegram or its employees can or will exercise control over the TON Blockchain following its launch,"" it explained.Telegram is also ""under no obligation"" to establish a TON Foundation, the organization designed to “promote and support the TON Blockchain,” according to the early marketing materials, the post said. According to Telegram's communications with the SEC in 2018, the company also previously considered changing the functions of the TON Reserve, another entity Telegram would launch to maintain the supply of gram tokens.The post also warned against buying future tokens on the unofficial secondary market that flourished after the pre-sale was completed. “Grams don't exist yet, nobody can buy or sell them before we announce the launch of TON Blockchain. Don't get scammed,” the notice says.Perhaps most notably, Monday's post seems to be attempting to retroactively negate any previous marketing materials about the project, saying, ""Please note that the below is intended to supersede and replace all prior materials or communications regarding the TON Blockchain and Grams.""Telegram has been fighting the SEC’s attempt to halt the launch of TON altogether. In October, the company secured approval from TON investors to postpone the launch until the end of April, after a previously scheduled Oct. 31, 2019, to give Telegram time to resolve its legal fight.The SEC demanded Telegram’s employees, including CEO Pavel Durov, testify in the depositions for the case. Durov’s deposition is scheduled to take place on Jan. 7 and 8 in Dubai. Telegram Vice President Ilia Perekopsky, known to have an active role in the $1.7 billion fundraiser, should have been deposed on Dec. 16, according to the court order, and the investor relations officer Shyam Parekh on Dec. 10.A short excerpt from Parekh’s deposition has been released by the SEC, in which he explained that roughly 70 percent of TON's presale backers and 90 percent of its Stage A fundraisers had approved pushing the launch date. Few backers opposed the delay, with the balance of investors simply not responding, he said.On Friday, the SEC requested Telegram's bank information to see how it spent the $1.7 billion it raised during the token presale. Telegram's attorney, Alexander Drylewski, in another filing responded that the company has already provided ""a detailed breakdown of all expenditures it made between January 1, 2018 and January 31, 2019.""SEC attorney Jorge Tenreiro, however, insisted Telegram did not provide all the information the SEC sought, such as how much Telegram paid its underwriters.""The SEC also has evidence that certain entities tendered invoices to Telegram for commissions ranging between 10 percent to 15 percent to Telegram based on the sale of certain Purchase Agreements, purportedly on the basis of contracts between those entities and Telegram dated in June 2018,"" the SEC filing says, emphasizing the data is important for the nature of the litigation:""These documents undermine Telegram’s claimed affirmative defense that the Offering was exempt under Regulation D. First, Telegram either raised more than the $1.7 billion for which it claimed an exemption, or it did not raise $1.7 billion as of March 29, 2018 and the later funds may have been raised through underwriters.""According to a court filing by Drylewski, Telegram again opposed the SEC's request to provide the information on ""every single transfer to and from"" Telegram as ""irrelevant, overly broad and unnecessary.""  On Monday Judge P. Kevin Castel of the U.S. District Court in New York declined the SEC's motion for Telegram to disclose bank records before or during Durov's deposition, according to a report from Inner City Press. Instead, the judge ordered Telegram to file a proposed schedule to disclose the information, or at least review for privacy concerns, the requested bank records by Jan. 9, after the deposition is scheduled to take place.Updated 20:40 UTC to include Judge Castel's ruling.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The company was sued by the SEC last year on allegations it sold unregistered securities during the pre-sale of its upcoming gram tokens, the native cryptocurrency for TON. However, this litigation does not appear to be halting any development on the TON platform. Developers, led by the TON Labs startup, have been kicking the testnet's tires since last spring. The new consensus protocol white paper will give these individuals “a formalized understanding of what they’ve been testing,” TON Labs’ Mitja Goroshevsky told CoinDesk.“Consensus protocol is a central part of any blockchain and it needs to be described for the further analysis of the blockchain and its code,” Goroshevsky said.The paper was previously planned for release in October, when the network was originally scheduled to go live, until the SEC's litigation disrupted the process. “The protocol hasn’t changed since then,” he said.The protocol was tested in December 2018 on “up to 300 nodes distributed all over the world,” according to the white paper. The testing apparently showed that “the TON Blockchain is able to generate new blocks once every four to five seconds, as originally planned.""According to the explainer TON Labs released, Catchain is a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) partly similar to those used by Tendermint (Cosmos), Algorand, Ouroboros and Casper. In Catchain, each round attempt includes three steps: validator nodes exchange block candidates for approval; the primary node for the current attempt sends the candidate block for voting to the rest of nodes; then validator nodes exchange votes. If the validators fail to come to consensus, the “round is skipped and the new block is not committed to the blockchain,” TON Labs’ explainer said. “If validators fail to reach consensus for a few rounds, new validator election can resolve the deadlock.”In its arguments filed with the court, the SEC has argued Telegram didn’t create a viable blockchain, as it promised to do. While aspiring to outperform bitcoin and ethereum, “Telegram has presented no concrete evidence that it has achieved that goal"" providing merely a ""vague, conclusory statement"" the blockchain is ""fully functional and ready to be launched,” the agency insisted.Telegram fought these allegations as irrelevant, saying, “It is the SEC’s burden to prove that Grams will be securities, not Defendants’ burden to prove their technology works.”The TON testnet has been in beta testing since March 2018. The company released code for TON nodes in September and called for investors to generate their wallets.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

the decentralized model behind bitcoin, it is nonetheless a radical change.","Jan 17, 2020 at 17:30 UTC","This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.","Michael J. Casey is the chief content officer of CoinDesk. The opinions here are his own.As the world’s most influential and self-entitled gather in Davos, Switzerland, for next week’s World Economic Forum, a predictable set of problems are on their minds: climate change, political polarization, trade tensions and cyber-attacks top their list of worries, according to the WEF’s just-released Global Risks Survey.Those are weighty issues. But if we look at them through the decentralization mindset encouraged by cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, it’s hard not to conclude that elephants in rooms are being overlooked. It’s with those issues, the ones not being talked about, where the real important stuff lies.The disintermediating, fragmenting and decentralizing impact of the internet has made the 21st century’s political and economic structure profoundly different from the previous one. But the Baby Boomers who run our governments and companies still tend to apply 20th century assumptions about centralized money and power. They fail to see how our outdated political and economic institutions are out of touch with this new reality, and how that explains society’s ever-waning trust in them. It’s a myopia that also means they often fail to recognize, much less understand, the alternative decentralized models quietly emerging from the developers building cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital identity technologies.So, as I head to Davos with my CoinDesk colleagues for a week of reporting and speaking engagements, I want to contemplate some of the issues “Davos Man” might be missing.It’s worth remembering the people for whom these issues most matter are not those cocktail-sipping elites but regular Joes and Joans. This year may well mark the most divisive U.S. election in decades. If our bickering leaders aren’t focused on these big themes, where does that leave us in four years’ time? We need these issues on the ballot.China is expected to launch a digital currency sometime this year. The question not being asked enough is: As this project grows – and likely many others from other countries and companies – what will it mean for the dollar-centric global economy and its multitudinous stakeholders?How will digital fiat currencies impact global trade and capital flows? Do they pose a competitive threat to the dollar and, by extension, to U.S. economic power? What would such a transformation mean for how the international community tackles the big-ticket issues Davos elites worry about: petrodollar investments in carbon-rich assets, for example, or global trade tensions?The digital yuan might seem like a superficial change, akin to a more advanced banknote or a state-run version of a mobile banking or payments app. But while China’s centrally managed approach to digital-currency technology is in some respects the antithesis of the decentralized model behind bitcoin, it is nonetheless a radical change.Two things matter: One, a digital fiat currency will circulate without banks managing the flow and, two, it is programmable, which makes it much more powerful than analog currency. Marc Andreessen says “software is eating the world.” Money-as-software might just devour it.A digital currency will enable the Chinese government to directly manage and monitor its users’ spending patterns. Putting aside the terrifying surveillance prospects behind this “panopticon” vision, this information-gathering power will greatly aid China in its international aspirations. Its economic response machine will be run by a far superior data-analytics system than anything employed by any other country.A “programmable” yuan will provide the missing payment component that hundreds of Chinese blockchain and smart-contract projects need. It will enable autonomous machines, micropayment infrastructure management systems, smart cities and other ideas the West will struggle to keep up with.As I’ve argued elsewhere, currency programmability, when interoperable with other countries’ fiat digital currencies, could also enable Chinese companies and their foreign partners to do a direct runaround of the dollar-based trade system.Currently, the yuan occupies an immaterial amount of cross-border trade and reserve asset holdings. But as this technology poses alternatives to the dollar and if China aggressively inserts its version into investment projects in Africa, for example, or into its 65-country Belt and Road Initiative, its international usage could grow rapidly.Recently, a Harvard-MIT simulation game found that digital fiat currencies could quash America’s capacity to impose sanctions on rogue states.  But the issue goes wider: If non-dollar digital fiat lets anyone bypass the intermediating U.S. banks that U.S. regulators lean on to catch international criminals, why will anyone use banks for cross-border money movements at all? Where does that leave Wall Street, that engine of American economic power?Some people, including former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo, have recognized this threat to U.S. economic leadership. But Chinese digital currency dominance does not appear to be on many leaders’ radars – it’s certainly not featuring in the Democratic primary presidential debates.So, come on, Davos, let’s talk about it.To be fair, privacy in the internet age, defined as the threat to our online personal data, will probably get a decent examination at Davos 2020. The Cambridge Analytica story, Edward Snowden’s unveiling of the NSA’s citizen-snooping system and the growing awareness that Silicon Valley behemoths such as Google are managing our lives, has put this issue front and center. It deserves to be.The problem is the structural factors behind this dangerous surveillance capitalism system are poorly understood.Most political reactions to the drumbeat of stories about data abuse by Facebook and Google amount to leaders tut-tutting at these companies, occasionally fining them and demanding they just stop being bad. Few realize that, essentially, they can’t stop being bad. These centralized entities, with their closed, non-interoperable “walled gardens” of data, have built their entire business models – and therefore their shareholders’ profit expectations – on surreptitiously and systematically extracting information about human lives.The other problem is the ad-hoc efforts to change these businesses’ behavior clashes with other demands placed upon them.Witness the contradiction in lawmakers’ critiques of the Facebook-founded Libra digital currency project. On the one hand, they demanded it protect users’ privacy but on the other they demanded it maintain all the monitoring necessary to prevent money laundering. Or look at how Facebook’s critics simultaneously demand its social media platform remove disturbing hate-speech content and that it also cease arbitrarily censoring and “de-platforming” users.  Without understanding the problem, people can’t see how holding both of these positions is untenable. There are two approaches to this issue: a political one, such as an antitrust order to constrain the internet giants, or a technological one, in which social media platforms move to a decentralized structure of user control (one potentially where zero-knowledge proofs or other advanced forms of encryption enable verification without revealing identities).Let’s discuss these options, Davos.You thought fake news was a problem. You ain’t seen nothing yet.As Arif Khan writes in this pre-Davos opener for CoinDesk, fake news is going on steroids.With people such as Jordan Peele using clever stunts to highlight the problem, “deepfakes” – in which image manipulation technology is making it increasingly difficult for people to detect reality-altering changes to a digital video or image – are starting to get people’s attention.Yet, the full extent of how much society depends on the glue of trustworthy information is greatly underappreciated. The foundation of our democracy, of our legal system, of our business relationships and of everything else in between is at stake when the truth cannot be verified.How do we get ahead of this when artificial intelligence is progressing so rapidly and when information is no longer delivered to us through central filters?A solution will require a combination of tools like AI detection software, watermarking and blockchain-based tracking of digital media provenance.It also requires stakeholders at technology companies, media organizations and government bodies to jointly establish standards for those technologies so we can all agree on how we’ll re-establish the integrity of the information we rely on.This is an urgent problem, one tailor-made for a mountain-town gathering of money and power.Let’s look outside the bubble. Let’s become inquisitive. Let’s abandon rigid, outdated ways of thinking. Let’s say goodbye to know-it-all Davos Man, because clearly he doesn’t.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Vo1t's data centers can be installed on the premises or accessed remotely from a client’s computer, and IBM’s enclave keeps client’s key exchange data encrypted, regardless of whether it's in transit or in memory.“Having this means our clients get to sign with their key in a separate transaction with IBM,” said Sebastian Higgs, general manager at Vo1t. The London-based firm, whose name is supposed to remind customers of a bank vault, provides custody, lending, staking and trading products for 35 digital assets. Since 2017, Vo1t has been offering cold storage to firms listed on the Financial Times Stock Exchange, Trust companies and other financial institutions around the world. It advertises a 45-minute withdrawal time for assets held in cold storage. While custody was once only the purview of wallet providers and crypto exchanges, banks and other large firms are pursuing the institutional investors who are becoming increasingly interested investing in cryptocurrency. “We’ve been looking at the digital custody space and how we could make our servers and our cloud platform be a killer value proposition for this specific market,” said Rohit Badlaney, director of IBM Z as-a-Service. CORRECTION (19:12 UTC): This story has been updated to clarify that IBM is offering secure data servers for clients to sign transactions in a different system, not providing data centers or holding client’s private keys.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

It would further authorize Hawaiian courts to hear digital asset claims.State Senators Gil Riviere (D-23), Sharon Moriwaki (D-12), Stanley Chang (D-9), Les Ihara (D-10) and Kurt Fevella (R-19) sponsored the bill.  In effect, the bill could clear the way for Hawaiian banks to offer digital services alongside their existing ones. U.S. banks have long balked at touching bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, fearing regulatory uncertainties and the assets’ at times illicit associations could spell trouble down the line.But the troubles go a step further in Hawaii, where even crypto-focused money services struggle to function. That’s because the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions requires crypto-licensed entities hold fiat reserves equal to their virtual currency holdings, a decision Coinbase said led to its shuttering of operations in the state in 2017.This legislative effort does not appear to end the “double reserve” problem, as Coinbase has called it. But it would, conceivably, give some legal clarity to Hawaiian banks. The bill’s language describes a low-cost, at times pro-consumer custodial system that could come online 60 days after passage. Banks would be required to pay a $1 annual fee and hire an independent accountant to examine their digital books.Customers could also authorize their custodians to transact with their digital assets. They would need to agree to the “source code version” the banks would utilize, with statutory ambiguities “resolved in favor of the customers.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Castel of the Southern District of New York issued an order inviting the CFTC's office of the general counsel ""to express its views on the issues presently before the Court."" The opinion can be submitted in writing, the judge said.  Whether ""gram,"" the cryptocurrency of Telegram's TON blockchain, is a security or a commodity has been the main question of the four-month-long litigation. The SEC insists the not-yet-issued grams were sold to investors as securities, with the expectation of future profits. Telegram maintains that, just like bitcoin and ether, once grams are issued they will be a commodity – simply the native token of the TON blockchain.In a memorandum previously submitted to court, the SEC said there's no way grams could be considered a commodity as “the value of that asset will have depended and will still depend on Telegram’s efforts to increase demand for and, thus, increase the value of that asset as purchasers reasonably expected and will expect.”""Unlike gold, comic books and Krispy Kreme donuts – commodities Telegram compares to Grams – Grams have no intrinsic value,” the SEC argues, so the value of grams relies exclusively on Telegram’s efforts to create a blockchain, and this, according to the Howey test, is a feature of a security. Telegram, in its responding memorandum, argued it had never marketed grams as an investment tool, but all the marketing materials ""clearly and primarily emphasized the intended consumptive value of Grams as 'the first mass-market cryptocurrency.'"" The main value proposition has been that the tokens will be widely adopted by users when TON is live, the memorandum goes.The CFTC has previously stated that cryptocurrencies ""such as bitcoin"" meet the definition of a commodity but the agency has not expressed its opinion on token sales like Telegram's. In a joint Wall Street Journal op-ed in 2018, SEC and CFTC chairmen Jay Clayton and Christopher Giancarlo said that ""many of the internet-based cryptocurrency trading platforms have registered as payment services and are not subject to direct oversight by the SEC or the CFTC.""Also on Thursday, Judge Castel ordered the first hearing for the case be rescheduled from Feb. 18 to Feb. 19, citing a delay in another trial as the reason for the rescheduling.

Announced by all seven members Tuesday, each institution will continue assessing the ""economic, functional and technical design choices, including cross-border interoperability"" of CBDCs and will sharing any findings. The members will also work closely with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI), an international standard-setter for payments and clearing, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a recommendations body for the global financial system, which has previously warned about the potential risks associated with stablecoins.The working group will be co-chaired by the newly appointed head of BIS' Innovation Hub, Benoît Cœuré, and Jon Cunliffe, the Bank of England's deputy governor and CPMI chair. Senior representatives of other bank members will also be included. Cœuré took over as head of the Innovation Hub, in part, to lead BIS' efforts in exploring central bank currencies. He previously told reporters in November the ECB was evaluating the future role for CBDCs when he had been a member of the bank's Executive Board. He has also chaired a G7 working group investigating the global impact of stablecoins. Although broadly supportive of private initiatives in this area, Cœuré famously referred to bitcoin as “the evil spawn of the financial crisis"" in late 2018. Although Christine Lagarde, then head of the International Monetary Fund, first called on central banks to begin seriously exploring digital currencies in late 2018, interest in CBDCs only really increased following the Libra announcement last summer. Since then, the prospect of a private currency initiative has accelerated central bank research and development into digital currencies. The central bank of Thailand announced in May it was moving ahead with its own digital currency project. Bank of England (BoE) Governor Mark Carney even suggested a digital currency alternative could replace the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency. China, which wants to beat Libra to market, is reported to be full steam ahead on its own CBDC. The new seven-member working group is not the first instance of central bankers working together on distributed ledger technology (DLT). Since 2016, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have worked together to release collaborative research reports investigating how DLT can be integrated into the global financial infrastructure. The BoE has also trialled various cryptocurrencies initiatives before, but advances in blockchain technology may mean this ""now might be the right time to try again,"" according to Bradley Rice, senior associate at law firm Ashurst. A perfect storm of global rivalries, the (possible) waning of the U.S. dollar and private alternatives like Libra mean it makes ""perfect sense"" for central banks, like the BoE, to become more proactive in researching digital currencies before it becomes an ""existential crisis,"" he added.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Feb 3, 2020 at 05:00 UTC","The owners of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, the Winklevoss brothers, have won a flurry of U.S. patents for stablecoin technology they say could be issued by commercial banks. ","Six patents, awarded between August 2019 and January 2020 to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss' intellectual property company, outline a system, similar to the collateralized token model already used by tether and the brothers' Gemini dollar (GUSD), that allows users to directly swap fiat currency for their digital equivalents. The stablecoin system needs ""trusted entities"" charged with generating, exchanging and destroying the stablecoins, as well as holding the fiat currency collateral on a 1:1 ratio with the number of tokens issued. A trusted entity could be the Gemini exchange itself, the patent says, but ""other types of trusted entities (e.g., banks, trusts, etc.) may also be used to issue, administer, redeem, and/or otherwise manage"" the stablecoin as well.One of the patents, awarded Jan. 21, describes a means by which entities, like banks, could create and issue new tokens to users quickly and efficiently. Trusted entities could also be allowed to charge users a ""processing fee"" for minting stablecoins.The patents also detail a means by which stablecoins could be used as collateral ""in financial transactions that are executed via smart contracts."" Another suggests dividends from securities and other such instruments could be paid out in the stablecoin. Last summer, Gemini applied for U.S. broker-dealer license that would allow customers to buy digital securities and receive dividends, all in GUSD. The stablecoin, which launched back in September 2018, has been approved by the New York Department for Financial Services (NYDFS). Stablecoin providers already use banks to hold customer funds. Boston-based State Street acts as the custodian for the dollar collateral backing the Gemini dollar. In December, the bank announced it would work with Gemini to examine reporting scenarios for cryptocurrencies. ""Our patent covers the unique way in which the Gemini dollar smart contract interacts with the Gemini exchange,"" Carolyn Vadino, Gemini's head of communications, told CoinDesk. ""Our patents protect the investments we make in the research and development of our products.""Given the patents' embodiments, it may be possible the system is being considered for licensing it out to banks or other financial institutions. It's also not apparent if Gemini would use the existing GUSD coin or custom tokens based on the same tech.

She's running for Congress in the Fourth Congressional District of Nevada, one of nine people currently competing in the June 9 Republican primary to see who will face off against the incumbent, Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat, in the general election in November.Were she to win, Sutton would be a likely candidate to join the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, co-chaired in the House by Republicans David Schweikert (Arizona) and Tom Emmer (Minn.) and Democrats Bill Foster (Ill.) and Darren Soto (Fla.). The group scored a small victory last year as Soto helped to get language into the Defense Authorization Act's conference report requiring the U.S. military to look into applications of distributed ledger technology. Even if she makes it through the primary, she may still face long odds. The Cook Political Report has the district rated as ""Likely Democrat."" That said, she was third in total campaign funds raised as of the third quarter of 2019, according to the latest Federal Election Commission data, and she remains well behind Horsford. She told CoinDesk she has benefited from media interest in the narrative of a beauty queen/business co-owner running for Congress. Sutton was Miss Nevada United States in 2014. She also happens to have cryptocurrency bona fides. Her company, Sin City Cupcakes (selling booze-infused confections in Las Vegas), early on accepted bitcoin from customers as payment. She also joined a consortium of angel investors that backed five different bitcoin ATM efforts.She has small holdings in a few currencies but she doesn't pretend to be an expert or a blockchain hardcore. That said, she thinks if she made it to Congress and got an audience with President Trump, she could make the case that these technologies might define the future of business, and the U.S. should not close itself off from a leadership role.The argument she would make to the President would be that the U.S. has an opportunity to hold on to its lead in this new sector of entrepreneurship, but, she said, ""I don't know if it would work.""Sutton spoke Jan. 7 on a panel concerning blockchain and regulation during the Consumer Electronics Show's Digital Money Forum in Las Vegas.Sutton was invited to the panel, in part, because of her experience as a small business co-founder who got into using cryptocurrency early. In 2017, the state of Nevada banned local governments from taxing cryptocurrencies, she explained on stage. She told the crowd, ""We were like: cha-ching!""But it turned out the state's policies had gotten ahead of implementation. Sin City Cupcakes moved quickly to get paid in bitcoin, but then needed to know how to document everything correctly. She contacted the state, only to find it really didn't have a plan for small businesses that wanted to take advantage of the new law.""So we just made up our own rules, as entrepreneurs do. We figured it out,"" she said. ""There was no guidance. No clarity.""These days, Sin City doesn't even convert the crypto it earns for cupcakes into fiat, though that's partly because not many people pay that way.Besides her involvement in founding a few companies, including a swimwear company and a shipping center, she's an angel investor, joining a consortium of investors that ended up backing a few early bitcoin ATM ventures.She said that through the group she's backed five such efforts, three of which are still live, though she declined to name them.Nevertheless, on stage she spoke of the confusion borne by companies founded just to allow people to buy bitcoin, only to find two different state laws that may or may not govern their activities depending on tiny nuances in their operations. ""And that's just Nevada,"" she told the crowd.Working through issues like this is part of why compliance is the largest team at Coinsource, a market leader in the crypto ATM space.She said that in all things, balances need to be struck between, for example, enabling business and protecting consumers, or free enterprise and stymieing money laundering. Broadly, she said, ""As a business owner, I advocate a free-market approach.""In particular, she's watched ATMs required to collect more and more information about customers. ""It's a bit in contrast to the premise of bitcoin, which is supposed to be this anonymous currency,"" she said.Crypto is by no means Sutton's top issue.She's running, she said, to give people in north Las Vegas and rural Nevada an elected leader who is more responsive to their needs. ""Politics wasn't in the plan,"" she said.Though she had only really been a presidential election voter, she started to hear that people were dissatisfied with their representation. She did some research on Horsford and decided, ""Someone should run against this guy.""When asked about her personal top issues, she pivoted instead to the big issues in her district such as water rights, immigration and the various military facilities in the district.Her main focus are the issues involved with running a business, and she'd like to see more people from business backgrounds run for public office, possibly for short periods of time as she plans to do if she wins.She raised over $127,000 in her first quarter of campaigning, and promises she'll beat that number with the next filing. She said funds have come in from around 40 states, as people have heard about her through the media coverage.If elected, she says, she will be all-in for Nevada and north Last Vegas ""for a finite amount of time,"" she said, because she believes in term limits. She'll be quite ready to return to entrepreneurship when she's done.""Don't get me wrong, I'd be taking a pay cut,"" she said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Kohli, an economic advisor to the head of the Indian state of Punjab. Mothanna Gharaibeh, Jordan’s minister of digital economy and entrepreneurship, agreed.As of this year, Gharaibeh said, Jordanians can no longer pay for government services, from taxes to hospital bills, with cash. They must use electronic payment systems like bank transfers or mobile wallets. “It’s going to be a tough transformation,” he said, referring to the nation’s poor and unbanked populations. “But refugees can take mobile wallets using their UN Refugee Agency ID cards. … We just need to stop printing [bills] and put it instead on mobile accounts or in bank accounts.”Unlike many dollar-dominance-skeptics in Davos for the forum, Gharaibeh said pegging Jordanian dinars to the dollar has served the smaller nation well for decades. He doesn’t see any need to reinvent money, just remove the anonymous properties. “Because we need to stop tax evasion,” he said. Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari – author of the bitcoin community cult classic ""Sapiens"" – said he’s skeptical of bitcoin. “Money is going in the direction of more and more trust,” he said. “Bitcoin is based on mistrust. It’s basically a return to gold.” On the other hand, Harari predicted the complete elimination of financial privacy could happen “very quickly,” which he described as a “dangerous” prospect.Ask almost any economist, banker or politician at the WEF about financial privacy and they’ll scoff. With shockingly few exceptions, most will say more financial data collection and passive surveillance will benefit society. (When pressed, they might emphasize the importance of encryption and regulating access to the data.) RegTech expert Diana Paredes, an investment banker turned CEO of the compliance startup Suade Labs, agreed the sentiment among her public- and private-sector clients is “cash is dead.” However, she added, it’s the job of policymakers to protect consumer interests.“What we should be doing is regulating privacy around [electronic payments],” she said. “I want to own my data. It should belong to me, not the bank.”Fear not, bitcoiners: Not all members of the Davos elite are pushing for e-fiat authoritarianism; some leaders here see a future where bitcoin continues to thrive.“Bitcoin is a fantastic idea, as long as it is monitored,” Kohli said, praising the compliance standards already upheld by bitcoin-friendly Swiss banks. Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, offers a shining example of a bitcoin-friendly politician. He said decentralized digital assets will have a role to play in the future of France, as long as organizations like the crypto custody startup Ledger and the bitcoin development startup ACINQ continue to pay taxes and uphold regular compliance standards. “We don’t want digital companies issuing their own currencies like sovereign states,” he said, making a subtle dig at Facebook’s Libra. “But we believe [bitcoin] can reduce the costs and delays of international payments. … We strongly believe in fintech.” Likewise, Mariam Al Muhairi of the state-backed Dubai Future Foundation says her team will spend 2020 exploring how to support companies that want to use digital assets. “It’s to help regulate that area,” she said, emphasizing the team is still in the research phase. “There are entities that do own and use [cryptocurrency].”Paredes added the best way to protect bitcoin’s usability is to educate regulators about specific use cases so they can make laws and compliance standards without jeopardizing projects of value.The divide between cypherpunks and banks grows ever more narrow when experts drill down to the specifics.Most crypto veterans at the WEF were just as enthusiastic about central bank digital currencies (CBDC) as the bankers themselves. For example, Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of Aza Financial (formerly known by the name of its retail product, BitPesa), said she’s “really excited” about the People’s Bank of China issuing a CBDC. She sees this as yet another customer onramp that complements the fact bitcoin makes up 7 percent of her company’s monthly volume.MakerDAO Foundation CEO Rune Christensen agrees: “Generally I think it’s really good for the trend of digitizing the economy,” he said of the CBDC trend. “It’s just a step toward more blockchain adoption.” His project’s DAI stablecoin, he told CoinDesk, could one day be the liquidity backbone for the world’s CBDCs.Meanwhile, Cloudflare CTO John Graham-Cumming said his internet infrastructure company generally takes a proactive approach to promoting censorship-resistance, even as his team supports clients such as banks and similar institutions in the public sector.“What goes over our network isn’t really our business. And we don’t think it’s our job to figure that out because that would be kind of creepy,” he said, adding the company runs gateways to both ethereum and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).From Graham-Cumming’s perspective, bitcoin is an impressive experiment because it actually works and continues to work, regardless of political and technical challenges. Yet, Cloudflare is more focused on ethereum. “When you look at the smart contract stuff, that’s a programming language. We think someone is going to build something interesting with ethereum and we hope they’ll find our services useful,” he said. “As people start to work with new organizations for financial transactions, they need to ask how that organization is thinking about security. … We’re all resting on top of something else.”The only way to protect privacy in a world of digital cash, he said, is with a combination of good regulatory policies and standard “best practices” that promote security throughout the ecosystem’s architecture.“The idea of Web3 is that you should be resilient,” he concluded.Zack Seward contributed reporting.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

In May, the maximum balance for which it will offer 6.2 percent annual interest dropped further to 250 ETH and, later on, to 5 BTC and 200 ETH. In December, the company made the terms more favorable to users, applying the 6.2 percent rate only to holdings lower than 10 BTC, with everything above that earning 2.2 percent annually.

without fanfare just six weeks after the collapse of Lehman.","Jan 17, 2020 at 20:30 UTC","This is part of a series of op-eds previewing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. CoinDesk will be on the ground in Davos from Jan. 20–24 chronicling all things crypto at the annual gathering of the world’s economic and political elite. Follow along by subscribing to our pop-up newsletter, CoinDesk Confidential: Davos.","Jeremy Allaire is co-founder, chairman and CEO of Circle, which, with Coinbase, pioneered the open standards CENTRE Consortium and USD Coin (USDC) – a dollar-backed stablecoin used in millions of financial transactions around the world. He has also been named to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) High-Level Advisory Group on FinTech. The opinions here are his own.When world leaders gather in Davos next week, they’ll confront an essential question: Can they seize the opportunity generated by years of innovative blockchain development to reshape the global economic order in a way that creates wealth and value for people around the world? From the fall of Lehman Brothers to the ensuing Great Recession, the international monetary system has thrown everything but the kitchen sink at trying to build an economic system that works for everyone, but those efforts have fallen short. It’s time to try something new. Fortunately, from the ashes of the Great Recession arose the first fruits of a solution: a new kind of secure digital money with no centralized authority, built on an innovative new technology – blockchains. This breakthrough was first described in the bitcoin white paper, published without fanfare just six weeks after the collapse of Lehman.  Since then, computer scientists, cryptographers, technology entrepreneurs and a deeply inspired global community has committed itself to building a more open and inclusive financial system. These blockchain projects are still in their early days but are gaining momentum with increasing velocity and force as large nation-states, big tech companies and the broader crypto community begin to deliver technologies for digital money that will reshape the international monetary system in exciting and unpredictable ways.Just look at ethereum and many of its competitors. They’re creating an economic operating system for the internet, designed to provide an open and immutable system of record-keeping, transaction processing and computation. And, like the internet, no corporation or government has complete control over these public blockchains – a critical element at a time of high mistrust in public and private institutions.Public blockchains mean it’s now possible to represent important records and assets in a digital form and to codify, literally, the rules for their exchange and use through smart contracts. This cuts out intermediaries, reduces costs and offers near-perfect auditability. Public blockchains made it possible to create global stablecoins, entirely digital representations of either fiat-pegged or fiat-backed central bank money that can be used and exchanged over the open internet similar to how we can easily exchange digital content.Stablecoins are so transformative they’ve enticed the world’s largest technology companies (Facebook, for example) and some of the most powerful countries (China, for example) to prioritize blockchain and crypto technologies. Stablecoins have also significantly expanded the range of use cases for public blockchains, which have been limited by the volatility of cryptocurrencies.  Stablecoins have rapidly emerged as one of the most important foundational components of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Unlike proposed Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC), most stablecoins are designed to operate on public or semi-public blockchains, inheriting many of the most powerful attributes of cryptocurrencies – open, global, interoperable use over the internet, and the ability to integrate and use such currencies within smart contracts. They also inherit some of the risks of cryptocurrencies and cash. These include financial crime and money-laundering risk and consumer protection risk through irrevocable loss of funds. However, through sound regulation, public-private partnerships and thoughtful operation of stablecoin networks, these risks can be managed. The first generation of stablecoins were issued and tightly controlled by individual private companies.  A proliferation of private and competitive stablecoins seems unlikely to lead to the kinds of standards and governance that can allow this innovation to flourish and become widely accepted around the world. We believe the right model for stablecoins is a multi-stakeholder model without a single point of control or failure.Stablecoins offer a tremendous opportunity for businesses and policy leaders. Neither camp alone can reshape the global economic order for good. The public and private sector must come together acknowledge change is necessary and set global standards that enable innovation at the same time they protect consumers and the soundness of the overall financial system.The CENTRE Consortium, which Circle co-founded with Coinbase, is one successful example of this new model. CENTRE has set out to build a broad consortium of stakeholders from both the public and private sectors. CENTRE stablecoins are designed to be multi-issuer, multi-currency and multi-chain. The first CENTRE stablecoin, U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC), is now the fastest-growing stablecoin and the second-largest stablecoin in the market.At Davos, I’ll be catalyzing a discussion about stablecoins in general and how central banks, regulators and the private sector can work together to create standards for stablecoins backed by central bank reserve deposits and ensure that stablecoins benefit the public and comply with new, well designed regulatory regimes. You can read a white paper that I wrote with more details here. This approach balances the need for open technical development and innovation (driven by the private sector) while also ensuring that such global stablecoin systems protect and benefit the public by meeting a reasonable standard for compliance. Global stablecoins and public blockchains point us towards a new architecture for the global economy built for the digital age, creating a financial system that is more inclusive, efficient, innovative, safe, secure and that helps create wealth and value for all who participate. Can we seize the opportunity? The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Corporate financial advisory firm Eminova Partners has been engaged to help file the offering, expected to take place in Sweden. ""Our aim is to bring bitcoin to the masses and to bridge the gap between new and traditional finance,""  Soderstrom wrote in an email. ""Being in new finance, a listing of the company via a traditional route feels like a natural progression to achieve that goal.""Launching in 2012, BTCX supports trading in bitcoin and ethereum, with the Swedish krona and the euro as fiat funding options. It also features an ""express"" exchange facility, enabling transfers between digital and fiat currencies that complete in a matter of minutes. Users have to complete KYC/AML checks before they can use the firm's services. Following the collapse of the ICO market in 2018, cryptocurrency companies have increasingly turned to more traditional means to raise funds. IPOs, which are heavily regulated and generally accessible to most forms of investors, allow companies to broaden their appeal and enhance their reputation among more skeptical elements of the financial world.""Choosing a traditional route could add additional transparency to an industry traditionally shaded in the eyes of the public,"" Soderstrom said. With blockchain-based alternatives still in a phase of ""immaturity,"" he added, a public offering would also satisfy any concerns raised by Sweden's chief financial regulator, the Finansinspektionen (FI). There are some disadvantages to taking the IPO route, however. Investors can still lose money, as when the share price for cryptocurrency mining rig maker Canaan dropped 40 percent weeks after an IPO raised $90 million. Similarly, Chinese mining giant Bitmain had to step back from plans for an IPO in Hong Kong after profits dropped precipitously in the latter part of 2018. Despite this, Soderstrom is confident that if managed correctly the BTCX IPO will be a success. ""We believe the traditional financial markets will be very interested in Sweden’s older crypto broker being listed,"" he said.UPDATE (Jan. 17, 17:48 UTC): A previous version of this article said BTCX had been established in 2013.

People and companies have an inherent need to authenticate any number of documents, Campbell said. While signing PDF contracts is perhaps the most well-known digital signature use case, Campbell said that, increasingly, digitized workspaces and lives require more robust platforms.Campbell said he built the file-agnostic Off-Blocks platform for the everyday, any-situation user that might need to verify a screengrab, a video or music file.“The big difference is you can sign any file in any format, however it’s presented to you,” Campbell said. “Imagine how you could interact with the digital world around you.”He said the service could be used by creators seeking to validate their digital rights and even car crash victims who need to provide photographic “evidence” to their insurance providers.Campbell said he’s positioning his service for wide adoption in the belief a second-layer solution is the ""only way to bring [the] masses to blockchain.""Market realities dictated Campbell’s partnership with Factom. He could not afford to pay often-high and volatile transaction fees associated with public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum, he said, and many of his prospective clients balked at interacting with cryptocurrency, still untrusted in some enterprise circles. If all goes according to plan, Off-Blocks’ first users will have no idea a blockchain’s involved. “You won’t find a single mention of the word ‘blockchain’” in the app, Campbell said. “It’s become a bit of a dirty word.” (The beta does mention the term, though.)But that doesn’t mean it’s not a valuable technology. Campbell saw no reason to burden everyday users with buzzwords; he does not consider himself a “tech guy” and therefore believed he had more to gain by staying quiet on the back-end complexities than attempting to educate a public still largely ignorant about blockchain.“Most applications now on a blockchain are built by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, trying to impress their mates,” Campbell said.  The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The SoV use ...","Jan 7, 2020 at 10:00 UTC","This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world. Ryan Zurrer is founder of Dialectic, a Swiss-based crypto-asset firm focused on on-chain opportunities. Previously, he led investments at Polychain Capital and served as chief commercial officer at the Web3 Foundation.","Store of value was the most viable and desirable use case across crypto in 2019 and offers a basis to increase users in the second decade of crypto.Collateral-backed crypto assets and alternative stores of value (SoVs) found their niche in 2019. Seeing crypto-natives begin to stake and save as part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution was one of the most exciting trends in the space. We’re also seeing the re-emergence of community-directed capital pools known as DAOs, which are arguably a SoV in their own right.The bitcoin community seemed to find common ground on its primary niche as a store of value rather than a payment mechanism. The SoV use case has become so compelling that the ethereum community sought to refocus around “programmable money” use cases: “ETH is money” dominated the discourse.DeFi projects grew quickly. Synthetix grew its collateral-backed synthetic derivatives market by more than 680 percent in the second half of the year. However, DeFi has always been dominated by MakerDAO, which offers loans in the Dai (now Sai) stablecoin backed by a basket of other ethereum-based assets. Dai/Sai may look like very capital-inefficient mechanisms with an interest rate that reached as high as 20.5 percent p.a. in 2019, while collateral deposits sit in excess of 320 percent on average. But it’s early days. These rates price in all of the risks inherent in crypto, from the security perspective to the protocol layer. DeFi interest rates should look more like emerging market rates (i.e. 20 percent+) than, say, LIBOR+1 percent. Moving into the second decade of crypto, I would not be surprised if we see some calamitous black swan event in DeFi, followed by a period of repricing risk appropriately. It is important we maintain perspective here and recognize many DeFi crypto-economic models remain highly experimental and there are important lessons to be learned.DAOs generated renewed excitement this year. Aragon passed 1,000 DAOs launched, which is a remarkable achievement. MolochDAO spawned dozens of topical offspring and considerable research is being undertaken to make DAOs sustainable and profitable, legally compliant, and more attractive to a wider audience. While DAO experiments flourished, especially noble mission-driven DAOs, most of these organizations were capital pools that store a certain amount of value, funded and coordinated by relatively small groups of known participants. Detractors argue that DAOs have significant regulatory risk and are currently not truly decentralized, autonomous nor particularly well-organized. But DAOs are evolving quickly, as are the coordination tools to allow disparate participants to efficiently self-organize. There is considerable discussion about how the use of reputation-weighted peer-review combined with the right social tools can dramatically improve DAO coordination. As we see DAOs professionalize in 2020, we will see premiums offered to enter the most compelling DAO communities while the vast majority of DAOs will trade at a discount to their assets under management (i.e. the store of liquid value that they hold). In cases where the management of a DAO diverges substantially from the original mandate for whatever reason, DAOs will unwind and return value to token-holders in a manner that is quicker and cleaner than what we’ve seen in the past.SoVs will continue to reign supreme as the primary use case across crypto in 2020. However, we must tackle a few issues to allow SoVs to form the base for a variety of financial applications.Primarily, we could make for more capital-efficient DeFi mechanisms. One option is to introduce non-transferrable reputation as part of a user’s collateral options. If a debtor is to suffer public reputational risk, they are far less likely to default on a loan. This would enable lower implied interest rates. We could also increase capital efficiency by allowing the underlying capital in DeFi pools to be staked, when a given PoS protocol permits, thereby reducing the interest rate by leveraging the protocol staking returns.Second, we need to figure out how to appropriately represent off-chain assets on-chain without being confined to walled gardens known as security-token exchanges or excessive use of centralized proxies. Intelligent DAO capital pools should probably have some exposure to gold and other compelling non-correlated assets in order to lower asset-correlation and portfolio volatility. I would personally be more interested in a portfolio that had diverse asset based while still ensuring decentralization.Thirdly, considerable evangelism needs to be dedicated to markets where crypto has the best chance for advancement – areas that have a combination of:Cities like Beijing, Hangzhou, Mumbai, Bangalore, Taipei, São Paulo and Buenos Aires are good examples of where SoV use-cases could gain substantial traction.Finally, we will need to figure out how to deal in multiple currencies across multiple chains as a new generation of technically sophisticated crypto-networks come online and begin to interact. Ethereum and the space generally will benefit greatly by interaction with other Layer 1 protocols and I’m optimistic that we will begin to see these initial cross-chain synergies in 2020 as other projects such as Filecoin, NEAR, Cosmos, Polkadot and others come online and gain traction.The adage that if you give someone a lever and an incentive, she can move the world seems especially poignant for our industry at this juncture. Using crypto still implies significant friction for most. Thus, new users to our space will tend to hurdle these considerable obstacles only when there is an extremely compelling financial incentive to do so. This may be avoidance of their country’s monetary misfortunes, the search for higher yield opportunities in an economic downturn and/or otherwise seeking better financing conditions. Nevertheless, a decade since the birth of bitcoin, we can safely say that crypto has found a compelling use case as the store of value reigns supreme.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

How should we respond if such a foundation collapses and if [China’s move] gives rise to a struggle for currency supremacy?” Amari said. As this year's G-7 chair, the U.S. should include digital currency on the agenda for the next meeting of the group, he addedA formal proposal calling for greater cooperation with the G-7 on the matter of digital currencies will be officially presented to the government next week, the group confirmed. The G-7 are expected to meet in Maryland this coming June.Japan, like many other countries, relies heavily on a dollar-denominated settlement system that allows its banks and businesses to transact all around the world. The Japanese economy could face significant disruption should developing nations begin using the digital yuan instead of the greenback. On Wednesday, a Federal Reserve governor said the U.S. central bank was ""conducting research and experimentation"" into digital currencies so it can properly evaluate risks and benefits. It would also allow the U.S. to lead in the matter, the governor added. Fed officials are said to be concerned by private initiatives like Libra and the effects they could have on the global financial system. The LDP group of lawmakers said in late January it would propose Japan issue its own digital currency in a joint project between the government and the private sector.Last month, the Bank of Japan formed a working group with five other central banks, including the U.K. and the EU, to coordinate and share research into digital currencies. The group will reportedly have its first meeting in Washington D.C. during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference in mid-April. During Friday's press conference, lawmakers argued Japan should prepare to issue its own digital yen. No further announcements have been made on the initiative but, considering the technical and legal barriers likely involved, Japan is not expected to release a digital yen anytime soon.

","The newly appointed senator, Kelly Loeffler (R., Ga.), will serve on the Senate Agricultural Committee, which is responsible for defining the CFTC's remit and approving nominations for commissioners and chairmen. It also includes reauthorizing the CFTC as a federal regulator. Loeffler was appointed CEO of Bakkt when it launched under its parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in August 2018. Under her leadership, Bakkt received approval from the CFTC to begin trading physically-settled bitcoin contracts, finally opening to traders in September. Loeffler, who only resigned her position in December to go into politics, is also married to Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder, chairman, and chief executive of ICE.Amid concerns her appointment would create a conflict of interest, Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal she had ""worked hard to comply with both the letter and the spirit of the Senate’s ethics rules and will continue to do so every day"". “I will recuse myself if needed on a case by case basis,” she said.Loeffler grew up on her family's farm in Illinois – a fact that's been emphasized in her marketing materials since Georgia Governor Brian Kemp first announced her appointment in December. ICE is the second-largest exchange operator by market capitalization. The company's expansion into bitcoin last year came after the CME Group started offering its own cash-settled futures in December 2017.  ICE's annual report said many of its exchanges were ""subject to extensive regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission."" According to regulatory filings, Sprecher has a 1.1 percent equity stake in ICE worth almost $600 million based on the current market price. The CFTC has treated bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies as commodities since a ruling in 2015. More recently, it investigated allegations against crypto derivatives platform BitMEX and suggested U.S. regulated ether futures could launch sometime in 2020.Regulatory concerns lay behind the nine-months delay to Bakkt's launch. Speaking to CoinDesk in April, Christopher Giancarlo, the CFTC's then-chairman, hinted about concerns surrounding the exchange's plan to self-custody bitcoin as well as clear trades through its parent company's clearinghouse. At the time, Loeffler said the exchange would ""continue to work with regulators to address the emerging global landscape for digital assets.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours. Adam: First, we turn to the daily bitcoin market briefing and important news affecting the crypto industry.Brad Keoun: Bitcoin up for the fifth straight day, with the price increasing to $7864, the highest in six weeks, in a pretty dramatic start to 2020.CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole writes that the rally appears to be running out of steam for now, hitting resistance at the 100-day moving average of $7,945. Technical indicators, though, are currently suggesting that prices are more likely to go higher than lower.Adam: Turning to the news, the International Monetary Fund’s Chief Economist predicts that digital currencies are not about to challenge the U.S. dollar’s pivotal role in global trade.In an op-ed for the  Financial Times on Tuesday, Gita Gopinath wrote that although cryptocurrencies present ""intriguing possibilities,"" they lack the infrastructure and global acceptance needed to supplant the dollar as the preeminent global reserve currency.""The dollar’s status is bolstered by the institutions, rule of law, and credible investor protection that the U.S. is seen as providing.""Brad: The messaging-app company Telegram says in a new web post that it won’t integrate a crypto wallet into its system until it gets the green light to do so from U.S. regulators, in a reversal from the company’s stated plan as recently as October. The announcement is notable partly because it signals a more contrite or at least compliant stance as the company fights a court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its $1.7 billion capital raise in 2018, which the U.S. regulator has characterized as an unauthorized securities offering.Notably, Telegram emphasizes in the post that its proposed Gram tokens are NOT investment products; the company capitalized the word NOT.Telegram’s CEO, Pavel Durov, is reportedly set to be deposed in the case today in Dubai. Adam: And in China, the search engine company Baidu on Monday launched a blockchain-based service for developers to build decentralized applications, known as dapps.The new service aims to make it cheaper for customers to develop applications since they won’t have to build their own blockchain platforms. The move comes just months after Chinese President (She) Xi Jinping announced that the country plans to prioritize blockchain as a core technology and encourage its use by small businesses throughout the country.Brad: And IBM, the computer maker, is launching a new app that uses blockchain to allow consumers interested in sustainability to trace the coffee they buy along the supply chain.The new ""Thank My Farmer"" app will allow consumers to track their morning joe from the store where they buy it back to the farm where it was grown. Consumers scan QR codes on the side of the coffee jar to look at the origins of their purchase, linking back to information stored on the blockchain, and they can even choose to make additional payments to the farmers who grew the beans.Instead of tipping the barista, Adam, it’s like an extra little something for the person who cultivated your beans.Adam: Turning to today’s featured story, this morning we’re tracking several threads from around the world which seem to indicate a growing drumbeat of national interest in blockchains, including some places you might not expect.First, we turn to the southwestern coast of India, in the state of Kerala (KERR-uh-luh), where the Economic Times of India reports on comments from the State Electronics and IT Secretary: “We are looking for intelligent use of blockchain in specific domains in the next five years so that its applications can be sustained. Companies that produce solutions based on the technology can sell it as products or services,” The secretary, told the Economic Times. He foresees the state as a talent hub for blockchain experts through the government initiative of Kerala Blockchain Academy, which was started in 2017. The idea is to train 20,000 people in blockchain development over the next two years. “Around 2,000 of them have gone for the next level in the blockchain developer programme and 800 have graduated,” he said.“The state’s strength in blockchain will be an incentive to attract the right companies that will trigger the ecosystem.” The state government is also trying to implement pilot schemes like using blockchain in land records, managing workforce, organic food traceability and immunization programs.Meanwhile, in South Korea, CoinDesk’s Daniel Palmer recently reported on a proposed embrace of blockchain, at least so it can be locally regulated, by the Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution.QUOTEFinancial institutions should be allowed to offer cryptocurrency products such as derivatives, according to a government advisory body in South Korea.To support such a move, the nation's fintech sector should develop custody solutions for cryptocurrency to avoid a reliance on foreign custodians, said the committee.The committee said the government could follow the lead of U.S. regulators and sanction products such as futures contracts tied to bitcoin. Institutions would also be allowed to offer other cryptocurrency services such as trading.With cryptocurrency trading surging worldwide, ""it is no longer possible to stop crypto-asset trade,"" said the committee, according to a report from Business Korea on Monday.Other suggestions from the PCFIR included, notably, that bitcoin might be directly listed on Korea Exchange, the nation's stock market.Finally, we return to U.S. shores where the Virginia state legislature is tomorrow set to offer House Joint Resolution 23.Quoting from the Virginia Legislature’s website, this resolution “Requests the Department of Elections to conduct a study to (i) determine the kinds of blockchain technology that could be used to secure voter records and election results, (ii) determine the costs and benefits of using such technology as compared to traditional registration and election security measures, and (iii) make recommendations on whether and how to implement blockchain technology in practices affecting the security of voter records and election results.""If passed by the legislative body, we’d expect to see the first report by Nov. 30, 2020, and potentially a second, more in-depth report a year after that.Now, is voting on the blockchain a good idea?  Personally, I have some doubts.  But it’s another example of the cycle of adoption repeating, and while those of us who have been paying attention since the beginning of crypto might want things to hurry up, this is in fact the natural way that people learn about new and unfamiliar technologies.Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at one cryptocurrency exchange’s costs of running a marketplace - in a fast-growing business that’s been known since its earliest days as a place where it’s not uncommon to see the movement of funds with dubious origins.Brad: That’s right Adam, today we’re highlighting an annual report published by the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken.It’s the 2019 Transparency Report, detailing the exchange’s efforts to comply, or in some cases not comply, with requests from law enforcement agencies for information related to allegedly suspicious activity.A couple of the takeaways here are, one, just how quickly the number of requests are increasing, perhaps an indication of how quickly the crypto markets, and in particular Kraken’s business, is growing.But also, this just highlights the very real costs of responding to and complying with all these requests from law enforcement agencies that might be following up on tips or other leads in their efforts to solve crimes or stop money-laundering. According to the report, there was a roughly 49 percent increase last year in global law enforcement requests from 2018 levels.Total requests rose to 710, from 475 in 2018 and 160 in 2017Included some 406 subpoenas, 62 percent of requests resulted in data provided28 percent of requests were non-valid, meaning the request did not meet local legal requirements and/or the company’s internal law enforcement production policyGeographic distribution - some 432 from the U.S., 86 from Great Britain, with most of the remainder coming from other European countriesMajority of U.S. requests came from FBI, followed by the DEA and Homeland Security/Immigrations Customs EnforcementCEO Jesse Powell tweeted that the cost to service the requests was more than $1 million, “substantially beyond the work of one paralegal.” Powell said that several things contribute to the cost, including that Kraken is an older business with eight-plus years of data, millions of accounts, and high security around accessibility of personal data. Another issue is that requests are handled in high wage markets rather than exported/outsourced to low wage markets. It could probably be 1/10 the price if we eliminated all concern for security/privacy.It’s important to note here that as this industry evolves, that some of these exchanges are choosing to publicly promote their efforts to comply with law enforcement, potentially calculating that the lion’s share of institutional investors who want to enter the crypto markets will want to deal with exchanges that aim to be squeaky clean and in full compliance with domestic and international authorities.

for crypto-minded people to discuss nutrition, organize fasts and ...","Feb 1, 2020 at 09:00 UTC",It’s been 27 hours since my last meal and my body is starting to eat itself.,"Autophagy, literally self-eating, is the latest dietary trend in the crypto community. More commonly known as fasting, the idea is to abstain from ingesting food for a set amount of time, ranging anywhere from 24 hours to an entire month or beyond. In doing so, proponents hope to improve their bodily health and mental acuity. With nine hours left to my own exercise in self-starvation, I feel neither healthy nor sharp. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’m hallucinating. I’m imagining the taste of last night’s dinner. Fatty salmon. The salt on my tongue. A bed made of arugula. Alas, just cotton sheets and pillow to chew on. My only consolation? I’m not alone. I’m skipping meals alongside the Bitcoin Fasting Group, a Telegram channel for crypto-minded people to discuss nutrition, organize fasts and encourage one another through their hunger. Using the predictable pattern of the bitcoin blockchain, which hashes a new set of transactions every 10 minutes, the group schedules 36- to 72-hour communal fasts once in a 2,000-block cycle, or about every two weeks if using a calendar.I joined the channel in the middle of January after seeing a tweet promoting a fast. Beginning at block-height 614,000, a bunch of us (it’s impossible to say how many of the 242 members voluntarily participated) planned to forgo breakfast, lunch and dinner for the sport of it. The fast would start in the middle of the week, and I wanted to test the claims it would improve my productivity. Katie Ananina, the channel’s founder, citizen journalist, and crypto bohemian from Siberia,  gave me some pointers before embarking on this extreme – though relatively short – diet. First, don’t expect much; second, like a good Austrian economist, “try to keep a low time preference” (meaning I should value long term gain over short term discomfort). She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to 'hyperbitcoinization'Ananina started fasting after going down the bitcoin rabbit hole in 2017. Once she began questioning the basic tenets of economics (which she studied at St. Petersburg University, before dropping out) her skepticism spread to other areas of her life. She now sees the fasting group as a parallel conduit to “hyperbitcoinization,” as both bitcoin and fasting encourage people to “exercise free will and self-discovery.”“For a subset of the cryptocurrency community, getting interested and invested in this technology meant throwing out orthodoxy about the nature of money and other parts of society,” Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, said over email. “Including nutrition.” Though the process isn’t fully understood, fasting kick-starts a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body burns fat instead of carbohydrates, which has been linked to improved feelings of well-being, increased longevity and something called the best-known nerve growth factor.“There’s a mountain of evidence that has caught on with the trend,” said Dr. Monique Tello, an internist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Tello has become a fasting evangelist after picking up the habit in medical school. She added that the best example may be how the practice has spread organically by word of mouth and on social media. (It’s how I heard of it!) “The internet has allowed alternative theories of nutrition to circulate, with communities forming around them,” Agrawal said. “The more people try it, the more data there will be. If that data looks promising to someone they may try it, too.”Successful accounts of fasts in the crypto community aren’t hard for Tello to imagine. “Our bodies are very well adapted to deal with long periods of less food or no food,” she said. The story goes something like this:Imagine our cave-dwelling ancestors, who hunted and gathered every meal: Their very existence was tied to the precarities of nature. Millennia of living through cycles of bounty and dearth are proof, for some, why human beings are not meant to be in a constant state of digestion.It’s this evolutionary perspective that may explain coiners’ experiments with heterodox diets. “The diet our culture has slipped into, high in added sugars and refined grains, is not good for clear thinking at all,” Tello said. Just as bitcoin seeks a return to a sustainable economic system that challenges modern monetary policy, fasting subverts the received wisdom around “healthy diets” and modern supply chains, which produce foodstuff in total excess. “Beef is to food as bitcoin is to money,” said a member of the bitcoin fasting group, arguing for a ketogenic lifestyle.Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research.The essential nature of a bitcoiner is “someone who can search out valuable information, think critically, and is capable of taking responsibility for their own life, health, and finances,” said Hodlonaut, the astronautical feline Twitter personality and early member of the Bitcoin Fasting Group, in a private message. Hodlonaut was an early member of the channel, and has been experimenting with fasting since 2017, about two years after he discovered bitcoin. The ever-quotable Nic Carter, venture capitalist with Castle Island Ventures, called this phenomenon “epiphany-induced general skepticism.” That this enlightenment to modernity’s shortcomings has resulted in as deep a skepticism of carbohydrates as central banking has taken the coin community pretty far out. In 2017, it was reported bitcoiners were switching to all-meat diets. The trend led at least one person to eat nothing but meat for two weeks. (For what it’s worth, Teller said carnivorous diets are “hardly sustainable” and “have been associated with high levels of bad cholesterol in the bloodstream,” though could lead to “short-term weight loss.”) A similar spurt of interest has been directed towards fasting. Since October, the Bitcoin Fasting Group has ballooned to more than 250 members, with more joining every day. No matter how someone comes to bitcoin or heterodox diets, proponents of both will likely offer their support. However, this assistance is conditioned on whether the person is able to make their own informed decisions. ""Eating a low carbohydrate diet is a good way to prepare for fasting,” said Dr. Jason Fung, author of “The Complete Guide to Fasting,” and frequently cited source in the Telegram channel. “The average weight loss during fasting is 1/2 pound of body fat per day. Total weight loss is often more than this because of water loss."" Ananina encourages members to be self-sovereign and do their own research. “Obviously, feel free to share your experience and ask questions, but the decision is always on you,” she said. Her philosophy is interwoven with the culture of the chat. With every documentary that’s recommended or research report posted, is a comment reminding others to draw their conclusions. Kiernan Wright, former CEO of the Canadian mining company Honey Badger, is also new to the fasting group. I asked him if it seemed cultish to schedule fasts around the bitcoin block schedule. “This is more like a club than a religion, anyone can leave or join at will,” he said. “Bitcoin is a wonderful tool for organizing things, to push the boundaries of what is possible and to do it in a non-violent, non-coercive way, which is crucial to our survival.”At the end of my 36-hour fast, I found myself neither hungry nor tired. After a period of ravenousness, the pangs settled and I was able to comfortably fall asleep. I woke up feeling fine, but wanting steak.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 31, 2020 at 08:35 UTC","Prosecutors appear to have a strong case against Virgil Griffith, the ethereum developer charged with conspiring to aid North Korea, legal experts say.","For one thing, the mere act of giving a presentation in Pyongyang might have violated the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) sanctions, depending on what he said there, according to lawyers interviewed by CoinDesk. So could attempting to transfer money between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and another nation, as Griffith allegedly did. It probably won’t help his case if the government proves he traveled to North Korea after the State Department denied him permission, as alleged.Griffith pleaded not guilty during an arraignment Thursday, which kicks off the next phase of discovery. Prosecutors told a federal judge some documents have already been produced, with more to come. The full amount of evidence they have to support their case has yet to be made public – including any exculpatory evidence that would show Griffith did not violate sanctions restrictions.The U.S. government takes sanctions “very seriously,” said Stephen Rutenberg, an attorney at the Polsinelli law firm. “It wasn’t like he was going there to play music.”Griffith’s attorney, Baker Marquart partner Brian Klein, declined to comment for this story, but has previously said Griffith should not have been indicted and that his team “looks forward” to presenting the facts of the case to a jury. Klein is quickly becoming a celebrity lawyer in the crypto and cybersecurity space, successfully representing high-profile clients including Charlie Shrem, Erik Voorhees and EOS’s Block.One, among others.The case is likely to be one of the most closely watched in crypto history. It’s the first sanctions case in a U.S. court involving cryptocurrency, and comes at a time when the technology’s potential to bypass international restrictions on monetary flows is starting to spook the financial establishment. For example, former high-level government officials and academics believe a digital currency in some form could help so-called “rogue nations” undermine U.S. global hegemony, as gamed out in November by Harvard Kennedy School in a simulation. Prosecutors secured the indictment on Jan. 8, charging Griffith with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and adding an unnamed co-conspirator to be charged in the future. The Department of Justice arrested Griffith, an Ethereum Foundation staffer and research scientist, in late November. So far, U.S. authorities have published a handful of documents related to the case, stating Griffith had been booked on charges of violating two executive orders prohibiting certain transactions and activities in North Korea, as well as some associated legal violations. While Griffith is perhaps best known for his work on ethereum (he’s long held a reputation as a hacker), the case is not so much a crypto case as it is a national security issue that happens to involve the technology, said Jake Chervinsky, general counsel at Compound Finance.“It should go without saying that any U.S. citizen who travels to North Korea and advises DPRK officials on how to evade sanctions will be in trouble with the authorities, regardless of whether crypto is involved,” Chervinsky said, though he was quick to add the defense has yet to be presented.“Although the allegations look bad for Griffith, we should remember that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence and hasn't had the chance to tell his side of the story yet,” Chervinsky said.Nor is the case about truth, justice or a moral crusade, said Danforth Newcomb, an attorney with law firm Shearman & Sterling with a background in litigation and sanctions. In his view, the case boils down to “the enforcement community’s understanding of the regulations,” which Griffith’s alleged actions violated.Executive order 13722, signed by President Donald Trump in 2016, prohibits U.S. persons from exporting services to North Korea.“The facts, as reported in the press, pretty clearly looks like an exported service, and I suspect in that interview he is reported to have given to the FBI he admitted to facts that amount to exporting services,” Newcomb said of Griffith.U.S. citizens are U.S. persons, even when on foreign soil, he noted.The complaint further adds that “Griffith began formulating plans to facilitate the exchange of [an unspecified cryptocurrency] between the DPRK and South Korea,” acknowledging this would violate U.S. sanctions and yet still expressing a desire to return to North Korea.Even if Griffith did not intend to conduct the transaction himself, simply showing the North Koreans how to do so would also violate OFAC regulations, Newcomb said. “In OFAC regulations there is a facilitation concept which says that a U.S. person can’t facilitate a transaction or activity that U.S. persons can’t do themselves,” he said. This could, for example, include telling a citizen of some other nation how to give a presentation on fintech in North Korea, which the complaint alleges Griffith did (though at least one witness to the conference claims that sanctions never came up). Griffith could see a few different issues in fighting the case, should he not arrange a plea bargain. Newcomb said there are few precedents that have successfully challenged OFAC in court, while Chervinsky noted national security offenses have “a significant amount” of precedential cases. Griffith might claim everything he discussed during his presentation is public material. The Berman amendment to the IEEPA prevents OFAC from restricting informational materials in the public domain from being bought or sold within sanctioned nations. But this argument may not hold up in court, Newcomb said.“I think it will be OFAC’s position that it is irrelevant whether what he discussed in North Korea was open source or not,” Newcomb said.The DOJ has been prosecuting national security cases for decades, Chervinsky noted. In recent years, the DOJ has even had a specific group – the National Security Division – responsible for such cases. “The law applies equally regardless of the type of financial tool that a defendant uses to violate national security laws,” he said. While the indictment handed down on Jan. 9 reiterates the government’s allegations in the matter, it is largely unclear what specifically Griffith said during his speech and what information he shared with the North Korean government, Rutenberg said. There is a difference between helping the government evade sanctions and just providing some basic, general information about blockchains. Griffith’s conversations with the FBI may also have an impact, at least theoretically, Rutenberg said. While Griffith was arrested in California, he was transferred to the Southern District of New York late last month. He was released on bail. While he has so far physically appeared in at least one of his hearings in New York, he now resides at his parents’ home in Alabama.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

","Blockchain is disrupting traditional finance, but will never overtake it without the same legal protections as its outdated predecessor. That’s Yusuf Hussain’s wager. As president of the Virtual Commodities Association (VCA), Hussain is attempting to map tried and true financial governance structures to crypto. Namely, he’s leading the Winklevoss-backed VCA’s efforts to become a self-regulatory organization (SRO). If successful, an SRO will allow industry participants to manage their own affairs – including setting standards for ethics, conflicts and judgments – akin to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for brokers (the intermediaries for trades involving equities, corporate bonds, securities futures, and options).Comprised of four cryptocurrency exchanges – Gemini (where Hussain works as head of risk), bitFlyer, Bittrex, and Bitstamp – and a litany of commercial consultants, law firms, and compliance experts, the non-profit VCA aims to develop ""well-formed, sensible regulation.""In an interview in November, Hussain said the industry is already moving in this direction. ""We're seeing less resistance from exchanges claiming regulation is antithetical to crypto,"" he said. Also discussed was how maturation will become a competitive advantage, and how traditional finance maps onto crypto. You have feet in both the world of risk and regulation as head of risk for Gemini. Could you explain the overlap between your two roles? The biggest connection between the two roles is that both the organization and the industry share the same risks: regulatory uncertainty. At any risk management practice, they identify the main remedial activities to close the gap. I’m looking to address this uncertainty at the VCA. Gemini has a number of employees with backgrounds in traditional finance or tech. Our prior lives inform what we think crypto’s rules and regulations should look like.Could you describe the process of applying for SRO status?The VCA is one of a handful of associations out there looking to obtain the SRO designation.  There are a number of different ways to get the designation. At the bare minimum, an existing regulatory body would have to sponsor the association and present it to Congress, where a bill would be passed designating it as SRO. The VCA recognizes that there is a specific path through legislation, similar to how the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] and SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] designated SRO responsibility over broker dealers and futures contracts markets. If you distill it, an SRO has two components: enforcement and cross-market surveillance. At the VCA, there are six committees; two focus on enforcement and cross market surveillance. So we’re building to that vision, and we have relationships with both the SEC and CFTC.How does the existing regulatory framework map onto the crypto industry?In the U.S. you have roughly 13 exchanges where you can buy or sell commodities or securities. Retail investors can’t buy those assets directly but have to go through a broker-dealer or register with the NFA [National Futures Association] as a futures contracts merchant. Broker-dealers are registered with an SRO to place orders on a market. Once a broker places a trade on an exchange on your behalf, there’s action behind the scenes to make sure you have the money and the counterparty has possession of the stock you want to buy. That’s referred to as clearing and settlement, which usually takes two to three days, a number of counterparties and also a depository and trusted intermediaries. With crypto, a retail consumer can directly interact with an exchange or choose to interact with a broker-dealer. Blockchain lets consumers buy and sell directly because the clearing happens instantaneously on an exchange. An exchange can play multiple roles because blockchain affords efficiencies and consolidations. When Gemini builds out products, we ask where it plays out in traditional industry and which agencies' remit does it fall under. A single exchange can offer a plethora of products from futures to ETFs to spots for commodities, stablecoin for foreign exchange and securities when that framework is finalized. What’s the deal with the bitcoin ETF delay? Speaking on behalf of VCA, the SEC has rejected ETF proposals since 2018. It recently sent a 100-page rejection letter, which maintained consistency with [its] previous rejections, citing market manipulation concerns. The VCA wants to enable the sharing of data to enable cross market surveillance, which is a vested interest for the industry. Speaking behind closed doors with the SEC and CFTC, they say cross-market surveillance is necessary for maturation.  What were the most important developments this year? The amount of attention from federal and state regulators. But the discussion has increased globally. There are other jurisdictions looking to pave the way for crypto adoption. There’s a risk the U.S. will fall behind. There’s also been a slight change in narrative. Where crypto exchanges and custodians once said, ""we don’t need the AML [anti-money laundering] or other regulations... it’s the antithesis of crypto,"" they’re coming around in learning you can’t challenge the most heavily regulated industry in the world without the appropriate sensible regulation. Do you think the regulators directed their attention in response to Libra?Not only. There have been a number of bills. When I started the Token Taxonomy Act was being floated. Now the register has a number of bills around crypto, some of which may have been incited by Libra, but broadly speaking the conversation is ongoing. We have a lot of educating to do on what crypto brings, so the bills are appropriately worded. To be honest, I prefer not to comment on Libra. The Gemini founders have already publicly commented. Any that you expect to pass?The things I hope to happen are the designation of SRO status to a crypto association. We’ve established the right relationships.Can you share the VCA’s view on the security/commodity transition? Each member organization has its own listed framework on what it means to be a security or commodity. Gemini is very particular to ensure only digital assets considered commodities are listed. The conversations happening are how to build a framework that explains how crypto fits into the Howey Guidance.When applying traditional financial rules, you always see a knee-jerk reaction from crypto. The key is sensibly applying the rules and regulations.Do you think there is an internal conflict in exchanges between privacy and transparency?A lot of exchanges think their implementation of custodial infrastructure is the secret sauce. There's a way to provide transparency without giving over the details of your competitive advantage in your SOC reports. Institutions that have trade secrets but continue to provide transparency through attestations is proof that there’s an appropriate way to disclose. After the exit scams and hacks over the years, it’s harder to claim you’re secure and have customers trust you versus having a trusted, reputable audit by one of the “big four” [accounting firms]. Gemini has a head start in minimal compliance burden. We’re not after short-term profits but playing the long game, by building a sustainable product. When regulation does come, we’ll be ready. It’s a competitive advantage and it’s how one day regulation will drive revenue.

Earlier this week, the Let's Talk Bitcoin! Show gathered to discuss Lightning Network technology and two innovative approaches at the wallet level which simplify the new-user experience at a tangible, but seemingly minimal cost. ","Subscribe to the new CoinDesk Podcast Network for fresh, insightful episodes nearly every day of the weekIn today's podcast we zero in on the challenge of ""Channel Management,"" until recently a mandatory and manually managed part of connecting to and utilizing the still-nascent Lightning Network. A little context: The way Andreas (someone already using Lightning) sends a payment to Stephanie through Lightning is either through a direct channel to her or through a route of hops that can eventually reach Stephanie.But if users are brand new to the Lightning network, how do they go about receiving their first payment? This question has been answered by both ZAP wallet and Phoenix wallet, using different techniques.This episode of Let's Talk Bitcoin! is sponsored by Brave.com, eToro.com and Purse.io.Lightning Topic Notes:Phoenix wallet is made by ACINQ, the makers of Eclair wallet. Eclair offers more advanced/technical users a deeper look behind the hood of the inner workings with channel management being a manual operation.With Phoenix, ACINQ has taken this away, with the aim of it being a more user-friendly wallet for the end user - A more Mom and Pop style wallet. When Stephanie, a new user of Phoenix, wants to be paid by Andreas, she will create an invoice on her phone, just like any other wallet. Andreas will then scan that QR code, send the payment and it will look just like any other Lightning transaction to Andreas.If Stephanie currently has channels open with enough inbound capacity, then it will complete successfully. But what happens when there is not enough inbound capacity or no channels at all?This is where Phoenix differs. Phoenix wallet offers no channel management to the end user, it is all done under the hood. The wallet ONLY connects to the ACINQ node, initially through a ‘fake channel’ and when an incoming payment is detected by ACINQ, the ‘routing hint’ that was contained in the QR code points to Stephanie’s wallet through this fake channel.[Andreas → Node X → Node Y → ACINQ Node -*-*-> Stephanie]Stephanie will then get notified that she has an incoming payment and be asked if she would like ACINQ to open a channel with her and push her the balance due (Turbo Channel). This comes at a cost though, 0.5 percent of the amount received. (Phoenix states that this is to cover the cost of opening the channel and allocating additional liquidity on its side.)POINTS OF INTERESTNOTESZAP takes a different approach to onboarding new users. Its aim is for users to be able to use their debit card to have bitcoin sent to them on the Lightning Network, even when they have a fresh wallet with no channels. Then the user has the ability to make payments on the Lightning Network.The creator of ZAP, Jack Mallers, has started a new services which he calls OLYMPUS. This service is standalone and can be implemented by other Lightning wallets, with there being no requirement for the Lightning wallet used to be ZAP.Quoting from the Zap blog on what Olympus is:“Olympus is an external service that clients make requests to. The service is responsible for the hard parts: onboarding users, processing payments, managing market risk, streaming quotes, and delivering bitcoins.”Once payment has been received by Olympus, it will then open a Turbo channel to the user, with the pushed amount they have just purchased with their debit card. With the use of a Turbo channel, the user is able to spend straight away. Jack Mallers has also stated that in the future Olympus will not only push the amount to the user but will also have some funds on their end of the channel. The amount to be staked by Olympus will vary depending on the users usage. Currently, Olympus is in beta and available to only a few select users in the United States with a plan to roll out publicly and eventually to other countries. POINTS OF INTERESTNOTESMissed last week's episode?

On the one hand, the added costs of compliance may burden smaller firms in the field, and possibly force some to fold or merge.“This will result in some closures and there are some early indications of that already, and in consolidation, where the industry starts to see M&A to scale up and meet increased costs,” said Siân Jones, director, xReg Consulting.Already, Deribit, a Netherlands-based crypto derivatives exchange, is planning to relocate to Panama because its home country's version of AMLD5 ""would put too-high barriers for the majority of traders, both regulatory and cost-wise,"" the company said Thursday.A good deal of complexity also remains over how AMLD5 will be implemented and operated from one European country to the next. On the plus side, the long-term effect should be greater trust in crypto from financial institutions in Europe. In particular, it should make banks more open to providing their services to crypto companies and attract more institutional capital. “It’s part of a global trend to bring crypto in line with traditional finance; crypto is part of the global financial system, even if it doesn’t realize it yet,” Jones said.Dispensing legislation over the EU’s 28 member states can be a lengthy and protracted business. As it stands, the accepted norms of traditional finance don’t map on to the crypto world. While something like an emoney license in one European country can be passported into another, the AML authorization schemes regarding crypto vary across Europe; France has one approach, Germany another, the Netherlands is different again and so on. This adds a layer of complexity when it comes to registration or authorization under AMLD5, said Malcolm Wright, head of the AML Working Group at the trade group Global Digital Finance. And if you happen to be in the U.K., Brexit throws yet another spanner in the works.Firms may need to just do authorization or may need to do a full license or may not need to do anything, said Wright, who is also chief compliance officer at Diginex, a Hong Kong-based firm offering institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets.“There almost needs to be a more coordinated approach to make sure it allows the industry to still flourish and offer services to residents in the EU who want to invest in virtual assets products,” he said.In the U.K., crypto firms will need to register with the local regulator, which is the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The consultation on the proposed cost of the registration pitched fees at £5,000 (about $6,500), with an annual fee yet to be decided upon. Firms will have until Oct. 20 to carry out the registration process. AMLD5 has been on the cards for a couple of years now and to some extent has been superseded by recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), first made in October 2018 and then updated in June 2019.Where AMLD5 covers only cash to crypto transactions and vice-versa, the guidance from FATF, an international body with 39 member countries, also includes crypto-to-crypto exchanges. Most significantly, it recommends applying payment data-sharing requirements from the traditional world to crypto, the so-called “travel rule.”“We are seeing some member states going beyond AMLD5 and now including these wider FATF requirements, and I think that is an example, if you like, of where other events overtake some of the slow processes of bringing in EU legislation,” said Jones, citing the U.K. as an example.“I think these FATF requirements will have a much more significant impact on crypto businesses. What might have been, to begin with, the EU taking the lead, the FATF requirements go beyond and apply globally,” she said.One area of concern is the way in which an extra-restrictive implementation of AMLD5 might catch firms that provide non-custodial wallets on a completely decentralized basis.This is something the U.K. and Germany were threatening to do, said Jacqui Hatfield, partner and head of Fintech Regulatory in the London offices of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe LLP. This would inappropriately include firms like ethereum-based finance platform TokenCard (which recently rebranded as Monolith) and crypto payment card provider Wirex, said Hatfield. “Basically, they are not a custodian; they are providing the wallet facility but it's on an open basis so they are not responsible for it. It's actually very difficult for them to comply with this if they are not the ones who are in control of those wallets,” she said.The FCA did not return requests for comment by press time.“I have clients who think that the FCA is not going to go ahead with it, but no one at the FCA has actually confirmed that that is going to be the case,” said Hatfield. “I think it's partly about being happy to gold-plate the regs and also just that they don't really understand the tech.” A disagreement has broken out over the definition of the term “license” in the Netherlands, where critics of the Dutch Ministry of Finance and central bank believe a disproportionately onerous version of AMLD5 is being handed down to crypto players. Banking compliance consultant Simon Lelieveldt said the legislation is delayed because of a “serious disagreement between legislators and industry,” and that the Jan. 10 deadline will be missed in Holland. The law is now in the Senate for discussion and this could take until the end of February or even later, he said.“The Dutch Ministry of Finance and central bank have topped up the regular AMLD5 rules with two provisions from the financial supervision law book, which are generic umbrella clauses, allowing all kinds of investigations and measures,” said Lelieveldt. “This [goes] against the explicit advice of the Council of State and against the text and spirit of the AMLD5 itself,” he said. “The Ministry misinformed the House of Representatives on the true nature of the law and played a word trick: by replacing the previous word ‘license’ for ‘registration’ they claim it is no longer a licensing regime.”The European Commission’s digital innovation spokesman did not return requests for comment by press time. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Markets Daily is back with the news moving markets over the last 24 hours, plus a look at Nakamoto.com's troubled launch and how it relates to 'Bitcoin Maximalism'. Later, Brad breaks down a new paywalled report on the upcoming bitcoin ""Halving""","No time to listen?  scroll down for the complete episode transcript...More ways to Listen or Subscribe:         Transcript:Adam B. Levine: On today’s episode, Bitcoin Markets take a breather,  the Nakamoto Debacle and a new report on the upcoming bitcoin halving.Adam B. Levine: It’s JANUARY 9, 2020, and you’re listening to Markets Daily, I’m Adam B. Levine, editor of Podcasts here at CoinDesk, along with our senior markets reporter, Brad Keoun, to give you a concise daily briefing on crypto markets and some of the most important news developments in the sector over the past 24 hours. DAILY NEWS ROUNDUPBrad Keoun: Bitcoin down today for the second straight day, slipping just below $8,000 about halfway through the trading dayThe market apparently taking a breather after a pretty dramatic rally at the start of the year, but prices still up about 10 percent so far in 2020 Adam: Now there’s a raging debate among investors over whether bitcoin should be considered a risky asset that trades like U.S. stocks, or a safe-haven asset that trades like gold. Bitcoin’s price surge, in the wake of the U.S. killing earlier this month of Iran’s top commander, lent credence to the safe-haven narrative.And one thing that’s interesting here, Brad, is that as we see a de-escalation of some of the tensions between the U.S. and Iran, we’re seeing bitcoin trade off a little bit.Brad: Turning to the news, the appointment of Kelly Loeffler, former CEO of the crypto exchange Bakkt, to serve as the new U.S. senator from Georgia is raising some thorny questions about conflicts of interest. That’s partly because her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is CEO of Bakkt’s parent company, the Intercontinental Exchange, whose biggest competitor is the Chicago futures exchange CME, which also operates in the crypto markets.  Many crypto industry advocates were thrilled when Loeffler was appointed to the Senate, believing she would serve as an informed voice in the U.S. Congress.And on Wednesday the news emerged that, indeed, Loeffler will serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee, which oversees the primary regulator that oversees U.S. futures exchanges, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. But amid concerns the appointment might create a conflict of interest, Loeffler told the Wall Street Journal she would recuse herself if needed on a case by case basis.Adam: And - in the closely watched market for stablecoins, the competition seems to be getting more fierce.   Circle’s USD Coin, a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, recently surpassed $500 million in deposits, only the second stablecoin to do so after Tether, and it’s now getting a listing on Kraken, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange. On Wednesday, Kraken enabled USD Coin trading pairs with bitcoin, ether and tether, as well as the U.S. dollar and euro, and the exchange said USD Coin enjoys unparalleled support from more than 100 companies and 60 exchanges across the crypto industry.But the rival exchange Binance, which is trying to promote its own stablecoin, said it would delist certain USD Coin trading pairs.Binance’s colorful but controversial CEO, known as CZ, tweeted that it’s “nothing personal, just low liquidity. No one’s trading it.”    Brad: Finally, in the latest twist in the mysterious case of QuadrigaCX, a crypto exchange that collapsed last year after the death of its founder, a New York hedge fund is seeking to buy claims for pennies on the dollar from users who are still hoping to get their money back.  The effort by Argo Partners, which also has offered to buy speculative claims in the case of another defunct crypto exchange, Mt. Gox, comes as some creditor groups are so suspicious of the circumstances surrounding the missing funds they want to exhume the reportedly buried body of Quadriga founder and CEO Gerald Cotten. Cotten’s widow reported that Quadriga held more than 180 million Canadian dollars worth of crypto at the time of the collapse, but an investigation by Ernst & Young indicates that most of it is gone. Segment 2 - Featured StoryAdam: Turning to today’s featured story, we’re taking a look at the rise and, I’m not sure if you’d call it a fall or a temporary setback, of the newly launched, high-profile crypto journal Nakamoto.com. Initially there was excitement about the project, with its Jan. 3 launch having all the hallmarks of rapid growth, big name contributors and general interest that outweighed the newness of the outlet.  From its Twitter announcement, the outlet described itself as “a new general interest journal for the crypto community.”Our goal with Nakamoto is to create a venue for technical, philosophical, and cultural writing that is of interest to the community as a whole, for beginner and expert alike. We want to discuss what is important even if not new, and avoid what is new yet unimportant.All Nakamoto contributors are pro-bitcoin (BTC) for the long term. We believe a commitment to the success of bitcoin reflects core values of our community. Beyond that, we are ecumenical and publish a variety of points of view. (source) https://twitter.com/nakamoto/status/1213336796379205632Pretty quickly, though, things changed and the response from some parts of the bitcoin community went negative, with takes ranging from @iamnomad’s “this seems like virtue signaling via tha nakamoto name so far. hope you can prove me wrong.”With many others demonstrating a lot less patience.“First article I read here shilled both #Ethereum and #XRP.I'll pass. The time to ""tolerate"" scammy failed projects as useful is in the past.”Things degraded further in Nakamoto.com’s Telegram channel, whose membership immediately ballooned into the thousands and quickly grew out of control, at least from the perspective of the moderators.  With all the attention, some high-profile contributors including Tuur Demeester resigned as a way to avoid “the drama” that, in its first week at least, has surrounded and to a lesser extent defined how the project is being perceived.The complaints being lobbed against Nakamoto.com are, to simplify, that by talking about things other than bitcoin yet by naming its journal after the mysterious bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, it is either misleading people who are there to read about bitcoin or effectively taking the Nakamoto name in vain.This basic idea is known as Bitcoin Maximalism. It's a form of fundamentalism like you see in just about every religion or movement once it grows past a certain size.  If bitcoin were a traditional company, it could have fans but it would also have a clear leader who defines and may even change the goals, and who ultimately is responsible for the project.But bitcoin is not like that.  It’s creators publicly abandoned the project in 2011, and that lack of structured, rigid leadership is a defining characteristic. But it also means that to its strictest fans, bitcoin needs to be protected from others who would take its name in vain or try to co-opt the movement with other projects, technologies or interests.  Does bitcoin need such protection?  That’s up for debate. Actually it sounds like a perfect debate for Nakamoto.com to host, if it survives.(Transition to Spotlight - SEGMENT 3)Adam: And now, for today’s spotlight, we’re looking at a new report from the data provider Messari on bitcoin’s upcoming halving expected in May, shaping up as one of the year most hotly anticipated events in crypto markets - and also one of the most hotly contested.One of the biggest debates among crypto investors and analysts as we enter 2020 over what will happen to the price of bitcoin this year as the world’s oldest and largest digital asset undergoes the once-every-four-years process known as the halving.This will be just the third halving in bitcoin’s short 11-year history, so there’s a raging debate among investors and analysts on whether this time will be the same or different.The halving is a key event in the life cycle of the bitcoin blockchain, encoded into the original programming set more than a decade ago.It was designed as a way of providing hard limits to the inflation possible in this new type of money, sort of baked into the monetary constitution, if you will - contrasted with government-issued currencies, where humans appointed to run central banks make decisions every couple months or even on the fly on how much new money to print.With bitcoin, the new supply comes from the data blocks mined roughly every 10 minutes on average, and when that happens the computer or pool of computers that wins that block gets a mining reward, currently set at 12.5 bitcoin.But this reward gets cut in half every four years, and sometime in May the reward will get cut to 6.25 bitcoin.Some analysts say that bitcoin’s prior halvings contributed to the big rallies we’ve seen over the past decade, and a big German bank predicted last year bitcoin’s price could jump to $90,000 this year because of the halving. But some analysts say this time it might be different, ostensibly since the market is more mature and since more investors now understand how the economics work around these halvings.A new forecast from analysts at the data provider Messari fit into the latter camp. Messari analysts Ryan Watkins and Jack Purdy argued in a post on Wednesday that some of the popular bull theories for the halving "" have little fundamental basis and that the event is a self-fulfilling prophecy at best "".The analysts argue bitcoin markets are generally efficient, but that there still may be a what they call a “hype supply cycle” that causes traders to ""trade the narrative anyway"". In summary, the Messari analysts are essentially arguing that the key to the halving cycle might not be an understanding of economics of bitcoin, such as the mining-rewards reduction, or even a question of whether savvy crypto traders have already accounted for this known event in their pricing models, but rather simply an exercise in mania and ""another four-year cycle of silly models"" that takes bitcoin prices to new highs.OUTTROAdam: Join us again on Friday  for the next Markets Daily from CoinDesk.  To make sure you never miss an episode, you can subscribe to Markets daily on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Google Podcasts, and just about any other place you’d like to listen.  If you’re enjoying the show, we really appreciate you leaving a review.

500 bitcoin, approximately $4 million at the April 2018 exchange rate.","Jan 16, 2020 at 15:19 UTC","The new owner of the Chrysler Building is selling a property worth $135 million to a blockchain real-estate company, taking a fifth of the purchase price in tokenized securities. ","New York-based RFR Holdings, which purchased the Chrysler Building in a joint agreement in March 2019, agreed to sell its majority stake in a commercial property in Zurich to BrickMark, a real estate agency with offices in Switzerland and Germany.Announced Wednesday, BrickMark said roughly 20 percent of the purchase price will be paid in the firm's BMT security token. The deal gives BrickMark 80 percent of the building, with the option to purchase RFR's remaining share until September. The purchase price has not been disclosed, but the value of the token share is believed to be in the tens of millions of euros.  According to BrickMark CEO Stephan Rind, it is the largest-ever real estate deal involving digital tokens. ""There has never been a token-based real estate transaction of this magnitude. We are implementing what was once no more than a concept in the real estate industry,"" he said. The property is situated on the downtown street of Bahnhofstrasse (pictured), where rent per square meter is commonly between $13,000 to $15,000 a year, making it one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world. In 2014, Swatch Group purchased a nearby property for a reported $409 million. One of the largest real estate purchases to involve cryptocurrency was the sale of a mansion just outside of San Francisco to a Chinse millionaire for 500 bitcoin, approximately $4 million at the April 2018 exchange rate.BrickMark's ethereum-based tokens are hybrid digital securities – tokenized perpetual bonds that will be backed by property in the BrickMark portfolio (for now, just this one building). BMT's price represents the property's net asset value performance and tokens will confer voting rights to holders. Under the deal, RFR will lead redevelopment plans to expand the Zurich property's rentable space sixfold, increasing annual revenue and, therefore, the value of the token.  With the Bahnhofstrasse deal completed, BrickMark plans to expand its portfolio. The firm plans to finalize a financing round worth €50 million ($55.7 million) and begin acquiring other high-value commercial properties in Europe and North America. More tokens will be issued in line with new real estate acquisitions, enabling more investors to participate without diluting those held by existing holders. Currently, there are only a handful of entities holding BMT tokens. Although restricted for the time being to qualified investors, there are plans under evaluation that would allow BrickMark to offer BMT tokens to retail investors through a European-regulated security token offering (STO). According to its website, BrickMark has a €1 billion ($1.1 billion) worth of property assets. Issuing digital securities makes the investable real estate market, worth approximately $80 trillion, more accessible to institutions, the company believes. ""Only 3 percent [of investable real estate] is available for investors through public listed real estate companies or real estate-backed bonds or funds structures,"" Rind said in a call Wednesday, highlighting that only a 5-percent fraction is ever traded on an annual basis. ""We think digital securities and tokens are able to unlock these tremendous values  and also give people, on a worldwide basis, access to properties that have [to now] been privileged.""“Unlocking the value of the remaining USD 76 trillion is probably the biggest addressable market opportunity in the world,"" Rind told CoinDesk. Other entities have also recognized the disruptive potential for blockchain in real estate. The tZERO security token platform and the Tezos Foundation signed an agreement to tokenize $643 million of U.K. real estate back in October 2019. Another real estate startup, known as AssetBlock, launched a commercial property trading platform on the Algorand blockchain in September.That said, previous initiatives have failed to meet the high expectation. One high-profile venture between technology startup Fluidity and broker-dealer Propellr was quietly shelved last summer because ""it didn't have sufficient institutional appetite.""Discussing the Bahnhofstrasse deal, Dr. Alexander Koblischek, managing director of RFR Germany, said: ""We gladly accepted the Brickmark tokens as part of the purchase price. We assume that digital financial instruments will also significantly gain in importance in the real estate sector in the future.""""The current transaction may have an icebreaker function for the sector in terms of its volume and institutional character,"" Koblischek said.EDIT (Jan. 16, 16:01 UTC): A previous version of this article said the BMT token did not confer voting rights and BrickMark managed a property portfolio worth $15 billion.

Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), David Schweikert (R-Ariz.),  Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced “The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020,” an amendment to IRS tax code that would exempt realized gains under $200, otherwise known as a de minimis threshold.From a practical standpoint the bill could simplify the tax burdens of day-to-day crypto users who must report even marginal capital gains under current federal law. This is based on a 2014 Internal Revenue Service guidance that treats bitcoin and other “convertible virtual currencies” as taxable commodities.This legislation does not alter that bureaucratic determination, but it would provide relief for low-level use cases, like transactions, while enforcing it against more substantial users, like investors. Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications for Coin Center, which lobbied the representatives on this bill, said it takes some pressure off everyday users. ""Extending this sensible exemption to cryptocurrency would allow users to do simple things like send small transactions to each other or fractions of pennies to dapps without having to deal with a fairly complicated capital gains calculation every time,” he said.The bill would retroactively apply to all qualifying transactions from Dec. 31, 2019. Representatives have tried to push through similar legislation before. In 2017, Schweikert co-sponsored more ambitious legislation that would have placed the bar at $600.

I’m Zack Seward, managing editor of CoinDesk, and I’ll be your guide to all things blockchain and crypto at this yearly confab of global leaders and their many hangers-on.Weather Forecast: Fresh snowfall on Saturday and Sunday has the skiers happy. ⛷For Monday, a high of 25°F (-3°C), low of 13°F (-10°C). Chance of precipitation: 10 percent.Blockchain is more prominent on the WEF agenda than in years past but that’s not to say the technology will have a starring role in the Congress Centre itself. The thing to remember about Davos is that there’s the WEF’s main stage (there are 53 heads of state this year, according to the WEF) and dozens of side events.Sustainability is a major theme of this year’s event, with climate change activist Greta Thunberg arguably being the top speaker (U.S. President Donald Trump is also speaking). And while the WEF programming on Monday is only opening ceremonies, other events will already be in full swing.The Global Blockchain Business Council is a partner of CoinDesk Confidential: Davos. Visit us at the GBBC Lounge at Hotel Europe on the Promenade.Here are the three crypto-related events on Monday worth knowing about:1️⃣ Cryptocurrency exchange LATOKEN is hosting the Blockchain Economic Forum at Guggerbach Hall. It kicks off at 15:30 CET with a keynote from Chris Giancarlo, the former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Hot on the heels of his newly organized efforts to push for a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), this session will be one to watch.2️⃣ Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys chief Joe Lubin is headlining CryptoMountain Rocks at Hotel Morosani Schweizerhof. Kicking off at 14:00 CET, this event promises ample discussion of decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins and what to expect in 2020. It’s going to be deeper in the weeds for ethereum fans on the slopes.3️⃣ The other event is clearly a can’t-miss about which I am not biased at all: the CoinDesk Confidential: Davos Kick-Off Reception. This party starts at 19:00 CET at the GBBC lounge at the Hotel Europe. We’re booked solid but make sure you click Tuesday’s newsletter for tidbits on any notable happenings. We have quite a guest list already including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, ex-CFTC chair Chris Giancarlo and many more. If you find yourself on a ski lift with a world leader, here are a few conversation starters. WEF insiders know these things to be true:CBDCs are government-administered, digital versions of sovereign currencies (but don’t have to be decentralized like real cryptocurrencies) and are a necessarily reactive development. The way central bankers see it, a widely used supranational stablecoin (be it Libra or something else) would undermine their ability to influence the economy through monetary policy. “CBDC” should be a busy square on the WEF 2020 bingo card.

As part of the hard fork, the Constantinople and St. Petersburg upgrades deployed in tandem on the ethereum network last February will be enabled under Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal (ECIP) 1056.The 20th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ethereum classic and ethereum engaged in a messy divorce following the 2016 DAO hack. Ethereum classic community members opted to not roll back the transactions enabling the DAO hacker to steal the funds; meanwhile, ethereum hard forked, partially reclaiming the hacked funds.Three years after the split, ethereum classic has engaged in efforts to rebuild community and technical ties between the two chains, Atlantis and Agharta being two measures towards that effort.As reported by CoinDesk, Constantinople included four ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs). Most code changes revolved around optimizations for developers, code edits for further scaling solutions and ethereum’s economic policy. Although different chains with different visions, ethereum classic is facing similar difficulties to ethereum, however.According to ETC Cooperative executive director Bob Summerwill, ethereum classic is showing signs of consolidation around select clients – the full servers which process network requests – similarly to ethereum. Parity Technologies, which recently announced its intention to step back from maintaining its code base individually, is expected to host 75 percent of the ethereum classic network as another major client, Geth Classic, is deprecated after the Agharta hard fork.“The client diversity problem on ETC is in the opposite direction [of ETH], with Parity-Ethereum dominating,” Summerwill said in the ethereum AllCoreDevs Gitter channel. “Geth Classic is being deprecated and won't be supported after this pending fork, and it looks like most node operators are taking the advice and migrating off.”At time of writing, ethereum classic has 252 Parity Ethereum clients, 167 Geth Classic, 80 Multi-Geth and 1 Besu for a total of 500 clients. Ethereum classic developers, including Summerwill, expect the Multi-Geth and Besu clients to fill the gap. Afri Schoedon, release manager at Parity Technologies and ethereum classic hard fork coordinator, told CoinDesk that client centralization is a small concern given the state of Geth Classic and available alternatives. Schoeden said Geth Classic has hardly been updated since its launch in 2016, leading to the deprecation.“With each fork you always lose some less important nodes that are not very well maintained. We don't worry about that,” Schoedon said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

crypto assets, for a CoinDesk Research webinar on lending and ...","Jan 31, 2020 at 20:01 UTC",Not everyone is totally excited about DeFi.,"Volatile crypto is nurturing its fixed-income side. Crypto lending activity is growing on decentralized finance (DeFi) networks. Staking, where investors reap payments for locking up assets in functions essential to network protocols, is moving into crypto's mainstream, with large crypto exchanges offering staking services for users. The slide above shows the growing popularity of one category of crypto lending, DeFi, among ethereum investors. (You can see that slide and others measuring the Web 3 use case of crypto assets in CoinDesk Research's quarterly review; we'll present the results in a webinar on Tuesday, Feb. 4: sign up here.)There's some irony in this, like a penny stock offering a dividend, but both lending and staking are emerging as potential factors in investment decisions for crypto investors. In December, we invited two fund managers, both long bitcoin and other crypto assets, for a CoinDesk Research webinar on lending and staking. Jordan Clifford of Scalar Capital and Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital joined us to discuss how they evaluate risk and returns in crypto lending and staking, what crypto assets' risk-free rate might look like and what DeFi needs to do to attract investors and new users. Here are three takeaways from that conversation. Watch & listen to the entire webinar here. For background and more information, download our free ""Crypto Lending 101"" report here.Clifford and Samani had a back-and-forth about the decision to put assets to work in DeFi networks that earn returns. From Clifford's perspective, the technology risks are manageable; Samani said at this point the returns don't justify the risk of losing investor funds to a ""smart contract"" glitch, for any allocation of assets to DeFi. Here's Clifford on how Scalar evaluates risks. He mentioned bug bounties, security audits and formal verification as ways DeFi networks can de-risk themselves as platforms for earning fixed-income returns on crypto. Human risk is a factor, too: “You really are thinking about counterparty risk as the main one. … And that comes in many forms, actually. Many of these DeFi contracts, they have administrator access that can do various things with those funds at the contract level. This is kind of an early stop-gate for many of these smart contracts to go live before they can be truly decentralized. That’s something to think about. It says it’s a DeFi protocol but often there’s a single organization that has keys to it."" Whether or not there's human counterparty risk to consider, there's always technological counterparty risk, Clifford said, which can be evaluated along the lines of a Lindy effect: ""Often, the smart contracts themselves, they act as a counterparty in a way, and they need to be vetted for technology risk. … What you’re really looking for is smart contracts that have had a lot of value custodied within them. The more time that’s elapsed, the safer it tends to be. If the contract’s held a billion dollars for several years the odds of it having a serious vulnerability diminish over time."" For Samani, current interest rates on DeFilending networks don't justify the risks, which include potentially having to send an email to investors explaining how the fund lost their money. ""It wouldn’t be meaningful to our portfolio, so it just wasn’t worth the time,” he said. ""What rate would be meaningful? Samani said Multicoin hasn't made that determination, yet. Is it a 1 percent premium over centralized? Is it a 2 percent premium? At what point are we willing to underwrite that? We’re not there yet; we hope to be there in the next six to 12 months.” Samani said he's not bullish that decentralized lending will be able to offer substantial premiums over centralized. ""There are always going to be people who will bridge that arbitrage,"" he said.Decisions about what's a meaningful rate come down to a premium earned for risk taken. This is usually calculated in reference to a ""risk-free"" rate. Of course, no investment is risk free, and that applies acutely in crypto assets. However, conversation in our crypto lending webinar turned to risk-free rates in crypto and how staking might play a role in determining such a reference point for pricing risk. ""In general my expectation is that lending and borrowing rates will be higher than staking rates,"" Samani said. ""I think for the most part staking rates, at least within each ecosystem, will be considered the risk-free rate."" Factors like staking protocols' programmed unbonding period make it different, but there will be workarounds to such lockups, Samani said. For example, exchanges offering staking services may be able to return capital to their users more quickly than direct staking would allow. Staking isn't free of risk by any means, Samani said, but it eliminates additional layers of risk on top of holding the asset itself. ""It’s native to the protocol,"" he said. ""There’s very few things that are native to the protocol and that is one of the things. My sense is, why deal with borrowing and counterparty risk when you can just rely on the protocol? You’re already relying on the protocol anyways, so if you’re going to rely on the protocol and add counterparty risk you should be compensated for that.""Samani wasn't bullish on DeFi, either. ""It’s pretty clear now that it’s pretty circular. There’s not too many people actually using the product. … The upper bound here seems to be the market cap of ETH or some fraction of that,"" he said. Clifford said DeFi needs better user interfaces and applications: ""We need to polish off the rough edges, get more time, have people talk about their success stories,"" he said. ""I think organic growth will come, it’s just going to take a little while."" Samani thinks DeFi's growth challenges are more fundamental. Crypto-collateralized loans aren't interesting beyond the bounds of existing ethereum investors. Uncollateralized loans, serving people excluded from the traditional financial system, would achieve that; they may not be practical without additional technology, like sovereign identity and credit scoring that can cross borders and operate outside traditional financial systems, he said. Look out for CoinDesk Research's next webinar.

Announced Tuesday, the deal will see the two companies collaborate on developing ""real-world use cases that are enabled by advanced blockchain technology"" using Monerium's ""programmable"" e-money, according to W. Sean Ford, Algorand's COO. Monerium allows clients to develop blockchain-based financial services, such as cross-border settlements, using any fiat currency of choice such as the euro, pound sterling or U.S. dollar.  The firm holds clients' deposits of fiat currency and releases them in digital form for use on a blockchain. The company said digital fiat currencies can create effective cost savings by removing intermediaries and enabling new complex payment types.Established in 2016, Monerium made the news when ConsenSys invested in its $2 million seed round in 2019. The e-money license granted by the Icelandic Financial Supervisory Authority in June 2019, allows the firm to operate across the EEA, which includes EU countries as well as Norway and Liechtenstein. Algorand was unveiled in 2017 as a blockchain with a highly scalable consensus algorithm. The brainchild of celebrated cryptographer Silvio Micali, it has attracted substantial interest from investors, raising more than $60 million in late 2018 and completing a $60 million token sale in just four hours last summer. A fund specifically for investing in the Algorand ecosystem received $200 million in commitments from investors including NGC Ventures and Arrington XRP Capital in October. In November, Algorand went through a significant update that, among other things, added support for smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) features. That included a new asset tokenization facility and batch transaction functionality enabling sophisticated transactions – including circular trades and internal account settlements – in one trade.""Algorand incorporates key features for many mainstream use-cases, including stateless smart contracts and scaleable proof-of-stake consensus,"" said Sveinn Valfells, co-founder and CEO of Monerium. ""The Algorand leadership has taken a pragmatic and deliberate approach in designing a blockchain for mainstream applications while staying close to the ethos of the open source community.""""Supporting new blockchains with mainstream relevance is a priority for Monerium,"" he added.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Obviously, this car, called the Vision-S, is a prototype and you probably won't be going down to Best Buy to pick up some USB-C cables and a new Sony whip. But the simple fact remains that an electronics and software company is moving into real-world mobility.","This is good for crypto.""This prototype embodies our contribution to the future of mobility and contains a variety of Sony's technologies,"" said Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. In other words, Sony wants a seat at the mobility table. In fact, since it launched this vehicle first it could be a major player. But the fact that it released this model at CES and in 2020 before anyone else will set a trend that will force other players to reveal their work.There is a school of thought that believes the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain happens when robots begin paying robots. These robots might be cleaning our houses, taking care of our elders or driving us around. Cryptocurrency becomes the value transfer medium in this scenario and all of the sensors, computers and systems associated with washing our floors or getting us around connect to the worldwide internet of value and, in the end, supplant most payment methods.Car manufacturers probably won't play ball. Car sales and car manufacturers depend on a few things, the primary one being that a human will buy an expensive hunk of steel and spend quite a while behind the wheel. Sony and Apple and Intel and countless mobility startups aren't harnessed to that antiquated notion. To them, cars are computers. The Sony car is packed with sensors – lidar, radar and cameras – and 360-degree audio with a huge, wraparound screen to entertain the driver. It is, in short, the beginning of a car-creation model that pulls the industry out of the 1900s and into the 2000s.The electric vehicle is built on Sony's own platform, which it plans to use in multiple body configurations. It has a reported zero-to-60-mph time of 4.8 seconds, according to Car and Driver, and a max speed of 149 mph. It's a real car with real power.We know very little about Sony's future car plans and the concept model is far from ready for the market. But eventually, this car and many like it will be communicating with each other wirelessly and negotiating traffic automatically. Your wallet will take a hit if you want to get somewhere faster  —  your car will pay another car to get ahead of them  —  and you'll spend or even earn if you can spare a few more minutes on the road. Roads themselves will request tolls for maintenance and, as we sit in relative comfort, we'll be making requests for applications, educational materials and entertainment. And, if Facebook, Apple and Amazon have their way, we won't be swiping a credit card.All of this assumes Sony and Apple and Google and Amazon are all thinking the same thing. Thus far, it seems they are. They are computing companies. Computing is built on open standards, and anything traditional car manufacturers do to prevent that openness will earn them a spot outside of the network. The new driverless, self-negotiating cars will also face driver resistance. Maybe we'll have a future where petulant car lovers boast they are both ""rolling coal"" and ""rolling meat"" by driving their antiquated vehicles manufactured before, say, 2025. But anything that stands in front of the onslaught of driverless, constantly negotiating vehicles will be run over.In the end, maybe this Sony car is a random pop on the future's horizon. Or maybe it's something else: the beginning of a firework show that will truly take this extremely nascent technology mainstream.

This is in contrast to a few exchanges that offer products somewhat similar to zero-fee trading, but require users to buy and hold exchange tokens.With a fee-less, zero-eligibility model, Blade is hoping to attract meaningful volume from the likes of BitMEX and other exchanges. Blade also offers up to 150x leverage, compared to BitMEX’s 100x leverage. The increased volume could come from high-frequency trades like scalpers, who enter and exit quickly, usually within seconds, using high leverage to make many small profits from large numbers of trades throughout the trading day. Scalpers work on thin margins and need lower costs to make money. If Blade succeeds in capturing a significant market share with its new strategy, it could trigger a pricing war, where rivals reduce costs to retain users. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Griffith was released on bail on Jan. 9, Inner City Press reported.A DOJ spokesperson previously told CoinDesk that Griffith's release had been delayed until he could satisfy his bail conditions.The defendant and others had conspired to breach the prohibitions of the act when Griffith provided services to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea without obtaining approval from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, according to the indictment. The developer is also alleged to have attempted to evade U.S. legal requirements during his actions. The document adds that one or more of the alleged co-conspirators is expected to be brought to New York and arrested.Griffith was arrested on Thanksgiving for allegedly attending a cryptocurrency conference hosted by the North Korean government and sharing his expertise in using cryptocurrency.According to a complaint brought against Griffith on Nov. 21, he had sought approval to attend the conference, which was denied. He then traveled to the conference anyway. “Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,"" John Demers, an assistant attorney general for national security, said at the time.After the indictment was released, prosecutors requested that Griffith be sent to his parents in Alabama immediately after being released on bond, rather than be allowed to stay in a New York hotel room until his arraignment. They also asked that Griffith not be allowed to keep his passport card while traveling, claiming that this ""poses a serious risk"" that he may flee the country in a letter.Griffith's attorneys, Brian Klein and Sean Buckley, responded that they disagreed with the government's characterizations and ""were very surprised"" by the letter. It was not immediately clear whether Griffith will be allowed to remain in New York through his arraignment. ""Virgil should not have been indicted.

American nuts are to be sold en masse to the Chinese as part of the extra $200 billion worth of extra U.S. goods that the mainland promised to purchase – $40 billion of that from U.S. agricultural producers.  At least that was what the new trade deal between China and the United States (so-called “Phase I”) provided for, in part.  Zhu Min, Chairman of China’s National Institute of Financial Research, looked relaxed at the Tradeshift Reserve Café on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in January, as he explained that Phase I would result in trade distortion. In agreeing to buy more U.S. agricultural goods than it needs, China has to divert its consumption of these agricultural goods away from other countries. Goodbye nuts from Australia, New Zealand and Brazil; hello nuts from California and Georgia. China agreed to cut tariffs on more than 17,000 products it imports from the United States.  It would also do more to protect the intellectual property rights of U.S. corporations.  The trade war was over, at least until Phase II negotiations would start later in 2020.  And then suddenly, due to the Coronavirus, China is closing up shop. Just as the Phase I agreement on trade was de-escalating the seemingly endless rounds of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, the virus was spreading around Wuhan and beyond Hubei province. The day Min spoke in Davos, Chinese President Xi Jinping, in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus, ordered an indefinite transportation blockade around central Hubei province. This crisis happened just as China began its national experiment into a digital currency/electronic payment system with testing in Suzhou and Shenzhen. On October 24, 2019, a day now called “China Blockchain Day” – President Xi Jinping announced his country’s blockchain strategy. It would be about interoperability. By layering insurance, healthcare, finance, energy, and consumer purchasing into one unified blockchain, there will be economies of scale and more efficient distribution of private and public goods.   It only works if people are back on the streets spending money and in the factories, dockyards, and offices earning it. But that will only work if people are back on the streets spending money and in the factories, dockyards, and offices earning it. It will be difficult to develop dependable and bankable use cases for China’s new RMB-backed digital currency when everyone is locked up at home under curfew due to the Coronavirus outbreak and containment strategy. As of writing, 28,000 people in the country have been infected and the Coronavirus is sure to become one of China’s growth industries this year. With all the Chinese factories, schools, and offices extending the vacation period of the Lunar New Year, there will be more economic pain. Even Apple announced it was closing all its stores for an extra week and the company’s corporate offices have also been temporarily shuttered. Levi Strauss, McDonald’s. and Starbucks, all major U.S. brands doing big business on the mainland, have followed the Chinese government’s lead and closed their respective retail outlets.  Most airlines have suspended flights to and from the beleaguered country. Travelers from China, assuming they can make their way out of China and into the U.S. are viewed with great suspicion, if not fear. The Chinese government has openly criticized Western countries for border restrictions and flight cancellations, complaining that President Trump is overreacting.  When China gets a virus, the rest of the world gets sick too. The People’s Republic accounts for nearly 20 percent of the globe’s gross domestic product and 30 percent of global economic growth. The second largest economic power in the world is still rebounding from economic difficulties that were exacerbated in its trade war with the United States. The Coronavirus will further stall growth – both on the mainland and around the world. This was the experience with SARS some 18 years ago. Back then the Chinese economy was a fraction of what it is today and it did not control the global supply chain. This crisis could be far worse – both in terms of death and in terms of economic damage. The Coronavirus could set back China’s ambitions to dominate the next era of technology - in artificial intelligence, 5G, robotics, semiconductor chips to name a few industries - but it could also lead to better U.S.-China relations and smoother distribution of medicine through collaborative blockchain projects. As awful as the virus is, everyone will win if we can defeat its spread. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The committee voted to kill the bill in November on a 17-1 vote, as originally reported by The Block.The bill would have required the state treasurer to develop a means for New Hampshire citizens to pay any taxes or fees due to the state in digital currencies beginning July 1, 2020. They would also have had to find ""an appropriate third-party payment processor that will process cryptocurrency transactions at no cost to the state.”Proposed by Representatives Dennis Acton and Michael Yakubovich, both Republicans, on Jan. 3, 2019, the language of House Bill 470 was brief, comprising just two clauses. The bill did not specify if taxes were to be paid fully in cryptocurrencies and if only some digital currencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, would be accepted. The bill had a promising start, passing unanimously through a subcommittee of the House Executive Departments and Administration Committee in February 2019. It passed with an amendment to ensure the state could still collect taxes in the event a transaction failed or was sent to the wrong address.However, cryptocurrencies have the added danger of being volatile assets, a fiscal note appended to the document states, meaning the value of revenue collected could fluctuate. ""The volatility of accepting cryptocurrencies could affect revenues due to tax assessments being generated in U.S. currency,"" it reads.This is the second time New Hampshire lawmakers have stopped a crypto tax bill. One proposed in 2015 that directed the state to partner with a bitcoin startup to allow citizens to pay their taxes in cryptocurrency was also killed off in the committee phase. A similar effort in Arizona in 2018 was stripped down to such a degree that the final version did not mention the technology at all; the bill was eventually scrapped due to insufficient votes.Taxes in New Hampshire can only be paid in U.S. dollars, while payments made in foreign currencies are usually returned. The only state that accepted cryptocurrency for tax was Ohio, which passed that into law in late 2018. However, the state suspended this service late last year after a new treasurer, Robert Sprague, took office.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

He is taking over the duty from the executive vice president of corporate development, Ben Reynolds, who will focus on the bank’s newer initiatives such as crypto-collateralized loans and the bank’s application for a New York trust company license. Earlier this month, the bank launched the Silvergate Exchange Network’s (SEN) Leverage product, which allows proprietary traders to put up bitcoin as collateral for fiat loans they can then use to buy more bitcoin, similar to margin lending in the traditional markets. The bank also applied for the New York trust license with the aim of providing custody and settlement for crypto. The bank, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November, is one of a handful in the U.S. that will provide accounts to crypto exchanges, startups and traders. (Signature, Metropolitan Commercial and Cross River are among the few others.) Early last year, Silvergate sold its retail branch and business lending team to focus on its specialty business lines, including crypto, a rich source of low-cost deposits. Richman isn't the first executive to move from Blockstream to a fintech-forward financial institution, however. As CoinDesk reported this week, Jonathan Wilkins, a Blockstream co-founder, is now chief security officer at up-and-coming bitcoin brokerage River Financial.Richard Bensberg, Blockstream's director of integrations, will be taking over most of Richman’s duties there, a company representative said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

exchange, designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin.","Jan 14, 2020 at 00:13 UTC","WisdomTree, an asset manager specializing in exchange-traded funds, is vying to become one of the first established U.S. financial firms to offer clients digital assets, including a so-called stablecoin whose value is closely linked to the U.S. dollar. ","New York-based WisdomTree, which oversees about $63 billion, views cryptocurrencies and digital assets as a natural extension of its business in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, according to corporate-strategy director William Peck. ETFs trade like stocks on exchanges but allow investors to allocate money to traditional financial assets ranging from high-dividend companies to bonds and emerging-market currencies. According to Peck, a regulated WisdomTree stablecoin could look similar in structure and purpose to an ETF backed by dollar-denominated assets like short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. But it could appeal to crypto traders since it would theoretically move easily on networks powered by blockchain, the computer-programming technology underpinning cryptocurrencies. “We absolutely see a market within the existing crypto-native community, transacting digital assets today,” Peck said. “Longer term, this is positioning us to be a leader” in fast-evolving crypto markets. The revelation that WisdomTree was looking into creating a stablecoin follows the announcement last week that it was the lead investor in a new $17.65 million funding round for the startup company Securrency, which specializes in tools designed to assure regulatory compliance on blockchain systems. Late last year, WisdomTree launched an exchange-traded product, on a Swiss stock exchange, designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin. A stablecoin from a regulated money manager like WisdomTree might receive a warmer reception from U.S. authorities who last year largely panned a proposal from the social network Facebook to launch a token that its 2.3 billion users could use for payments. Dollar-linked tokens like tether, USD Coin and MakerDAO’s Dai - launched by crypto industry programmers and entrepreneurs - have evolved to become a de facto form of cash in digital-asset markets, though none of those are regulated as registered securities. WisdomTree hasn’t filed any public, formal proposals with securities regulators for digital assets, according to Peck, and he declined to provide a timeline for any plans. Big money managers often discuss proposals privately with regulators prior to making a formal filing.  “This is going to be something that we would proactively bring to them,” Peck said.Boston-based Fidelity Investments, which manages or administers about $7.8 trillion of customer assets, argued in a report last week that the potential of bitcoin, the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, “cannot be ignored.” “There's a belief among some that blockchain-based infrastructure is going to be more and more critical in financial services going forward,” said Peck. “We feel like this kind of step is a way in which WisdomTree can be involved if the world evolves in that way.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Feb 10, 2020 at 17:30 UTC","Enterprise blockchain is a catalyst for further spending at Big Blue, according to Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice president of blockchain technologies.","""It is driving additional spend,” Cuomo said. “When you look at the direct attribution of the actual dollars spent on blockchain, we are seeing that for every dollar spent, $15 is spent on other cloud services.”The back-of-the-envelope math offers a revealing glimpse into the storied tech company’s current thinking on blockchain. Cuomo’s revenue figure comes as IBM works to bring enterprise blockchain closer into the company’s sprawling cloud offering. Some commentators have described the move as a reprioritization or even consolidation following the dissipating hype surrounding distributed ledger technology (DLT).“Blockchain is a new class of enterprise application,” Cuomo told CoinDesk. “It plays into trends like app modernization and new cloud-native applications, data and analytics. It crosses all those things.” As such, the blockchain part of a blockchain application only accounts for about 20 percent of the overall solution, said Cuomo. That leaves 80 percent in other tech for bringing the network to life. The bigger picture concerns tectonic shifts in Big Blue’s overall business strategy. Last year’s $34 billion acquisition of open source software giant Red Hat seems to be paying off. In its Q4 2019 results, IBM posted what analysts called surprising revenue growth: cloud and cognitive software revenue were up 9 percent, while Red Hat posted 24 percent revenue growth.In addition, IBM chief Ginny Rometty is stepping down to make way for a new CEO, Arvind Krishna, the head of the cloud and cognitive business and architect of the Red Hat deal. Krishna takes over officially on April 6.Regarding IBM’s changing priorities, Cuomo said IBM has “put its chips down on the table in a very aggressive way around the hybrid space.”Hybrid cloud, a market worth some $1.2 trillion, according to McKinsey & Company, comprises a mix of on-premise, private-cloud and public-cloud services, where workloads can be handled across these different platforms. Drilling into potential synergies between blockchain and cloud, Cuomo pointed to “a wedding ceremony” arranged by IBM between Hyperledger Fabric – the Linux-based greenhouse for incubating enterprise blockchain projects – and Kubernetes – a platform for automating and scaling clusters of services across hybrid cloud systems. Kubernetes is a technology Red Hat has lots of expertise in, as exemplified by its OpenShift platform. “Hyperledger Fabric works well with Kubernetes,” Cuomo said. “Many of the things we've done around Chaincode, which is the way we plug smart contracts into Fabric, is to make sure it runs really well on that type of containerized environment with buttoned-down security. Red Hat gave us that motivation.”Ask Cuomo if the “trough of disillusionment” has meant enterprise adoption of blockchain tech has slowed down, and he’s defiant. “That's 180 degrees from my observation. If anything, maybe the number of inbound projects has stabilized. But the thing I’ve noticed is the quality of the projects and sponsors of the projects really being thoughtful about what they are doing,” Cuomo said. Describing 2018 as “more of a Wild West,” he added:“We had a lot of projects. Some would hit, others missed. The ideas weren't always completely baked. Going into 2020, clients continue to get smarter.”The fact remains, there have been some noticeable contractions in the enterprise blockchain world of late. Might there yet be some bloodletting on the blockchain side at IBM? Cuomo says no: “We are very healthy here in blockchain land.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

""In fact, the overwhelming majority of these purported 'verified providers' had expressed no such willingness and were not contributing content to Opporty's platform,"" according to the complaint.Opporty also allegedly claimed to have 17 million small U.S. businesses in its catalog, suggesting to investors that all these firms were genuine businesses eligible to do business on the platform. However, the SEC states, the firm had merely bought a database of entity and individual profiles. This was not disclosed to investors in the token, alleges the complaint.Had the firm registered the sale with the SEC, it would have meant investors could have been provided ""sufficient, accurate information relating to the ICO,"" the regulator says.Oppty's tokens were sold via purchase agreements called ""simple agreements for future tokens"" (SAFTs) – a framework once touted as being a way to avoid such regulatory actions. As such, they ""constituted investment contracts and, thus, securities,"" the SEC says.The complaint indicates the SEC seeks to have the defendants return the ""ill-gotten gains"" from the ICO, refrain from future issuances of securities and pay civil penalties.

Christopher Giancarlo, former LabCFTC Director Daniel Gorfine and investor Charles Giancarlo want to take the dollar digital – and they're not waiting for the Federal Reserve.","The three are forming the Digital Dollar Foundation, working with Accenture to design and push for a potential U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC). The new not-for-profit organization has a multi-part plan to first create potential designs and proposals; convene economists, lawyers, academics, technologists and others to evaluate these designs; and create a framework for testing the new system, all with the goal of making dollar transactions as seamless as a text message.The idea isn’t new: The former CFTC officials called for using a blockchain platform to support a digital dollar since an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal last October. Essentially, a non-governmental group would run the project, with support from the Federal Reserve and other stakeholders. An analog reserve currency does not serve modern users, Giancarlo, the former CFTC chairman, said in a statement Thursday. “A digital dollar would help future-proof the greenback and allow individuals and global enterprises to make payments in dollars irrespective of space and time,” he said. The proposed digital dollar would be a tokenized form of the U.S. currency, which would work with other existing Fed liabilities but act as a digital settlement medium. The digital dollar would “meet the demands of the new digital world and a cheaper, faster and more inclusive global financial system,” Giancarlo said. Accenture will act as the chief architect and technology partner on the project. In a statement, Accenture global blockchain lead and managing partner David Treat said the firm would bring together some of the stakeholders to combine both real-world experience and new technological abilities to drive the project.Giancarlo said Accenture has worked with a number of central banks, including the Bank of Canada, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the European Central Bank, to innovate around existing systems.In particular, he highlighted the firm’s work with Sweden’s Riksbank on designing the ekrona.Treat told CoinDesk via a spokesperson that Accenture has already invested heavily in the space, particularly with regard to CBDC and ""the inherent value use cases. CBDCs can also support other digital ledger-based projects, he said.  ""As an example, the ability to directly exchange a CBDC for a tokenized security will have profound effects on global capital markets,"" he said.To begin with, the foundation will hold meetings, roundtable discussions and open forums to look into different approaches to creating a digital dollar. “Core governmental interests,” including support for existing Fed projects, will also be considered, the press release noted.This initial effort will culminate in a set of principles, which will then be compared to stakeholder needs and the practical requirements for a CBDC, as well as evaluated for U.S. legal compliance, the release said. Fed buy-in is key: The digital dollar would have to be backed by the U.S. central bank, unlike most existing cryptocurrencies and dollar-pegged stablecoins. Notably, the Digital Dollar Foundation's proposals would look to preserve the existing financial system, not replace or otherwise supersede it, according to the press release.As such, it is likely to take into account, if not outright coordinate with, the FedNow project, the Fed's real-time payment system. While rumors that the central bank would develop its own digital payment rails have persisted for years, the entity only formally announced the effort last year. To date, it does not appear as though FedNow will utilize a blockchain, though the project is in an early stage. Still, what is clear is Fed governors and Chairman Jerome Powell are aware of the technology, and are at least evaluating the potential use of a blockchain to support the system.U.S. congressmen French Hill (R-Ark.) and Bill Foster (D-Ill.) have even weighed into the debate, asking Powell whether using a blockchain-based CBDC was feasible or worth the effort. Powell has so far responded that while the Fed is looking into the matter, he doesn't yet see if there will be any significant benefit to pursuing monetary policy with a CBDC.Gorfine, who previously ran the CFTC's financial technology initiative in LabCFTC, told CoinDesk via email that a number of issues must be worked out before a U.S. CBDC can be issued, including legal, economic, privacy, security and technology concerns.""These are some of the issues we intend to explore and we will do so with a broad range of stakeholders through a phased approach that may include actual or proposed pilots,"" he said. ""Ultimately, a digital dollar would need to be issued by the Fed, and our goal is to advance a framework for potential, practical steps that could support such an effort.""Thursday's announcement comes amid growing rumors that China may soon be ready to launch its own central bank digital currency. The full details and scope of China's project are unknown, though it appears possible that the country could try to take on the U.S. dollar's dominance of the global financial system. It remains to be seen whether a digital renminbi could take on the dollar in dominating the global financial system. Jerry Brito, executive director at industry think tank Coin Center, argued in a blog post the renminbi's fundamentals will not change just because it is placed on a blockchain, and therefore a Chinese CBDC poses no threat to the U.S. dollar. Still, former senior U.S. government officials and academics have considered the possibility that nations like North Korea could use a digital renminbi to bypass sanctions while hostile actors target the aging infrastructure supporting remittances today, like the SWIFT Network.Other nations are also looking to issue their own CBDCs. The Marshall Islands is perhaps one of the most advanced, announcing last year it would issue the Marshallese sovereign in two stages: first, a private pre-sale to gauge liquidity, followed by the public issuance sometime within the next two years.Private groups are also looking to serve the declared need for a global, scalable means of transmission, most famously the Libra stablecoin project, which social media giant Facebook announced in June as an effort to create an international payment system specifically targeting un- or underbanked individuals.The new digital dollar envisioned by Giancarlo and Gorfine would fulfill the same niche, but act more simply as just the 21st century dollar, however. “It must … reduce costs, foster security, improve transparency and serve as an effective digital settlement medium nationally and internationally to make the dollar a better currency for all of its global users,” the press release said.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

I have seen a copy of this petition and believe it to be legitimate,” he wrote.However, two of the employees who filed the petition were fired, “apparently in retaliation,” he alleged. He is also concerned that LedgerX may no longer be compliant with regulatory requirements and may be failing in its fiduciary duties. LedgerX board member Mark Wetjen did not immediately return a request for comment.In his letter, Gunden suggested that Juthica Chou’s suspension from her roles as chief financial and risk officer of the company may be posing more harm than good to LedgerX.He detailed the meeting the board held to suspend Juthica and her husband Paul, saying “an extreme and one-sided case” was presented against the two, but there was no opportunity for defense. “While a case can be made against Paul due to his recent external communications, no comparable case can be made against Juthica, and yet she is being removed as well in spite of being the best suited candidate for CEO,” he said. He appears to be referencing Tweets and possibly letters written by Paul Chou alleging wrongdoing on the part of the CFTC after the company was not allowed to launch physically-settled bitcoin futures contracts last year.“Just days after Paul and Juthica were placed on administrative leave, a petition was circulated at the office, which 75% of employees signed in support of retaining Paul and Juthica’s leadership. I have seen a copy of this petition and believe it to be legitimate,” he wrote.However, two of the employees who filed the petition were fired, “apparently in retaliation,” Gunden alleged. Shareholder letters “outlining concerns” with the interim management had been ignored, and while some minority investors in the company have expressed interest in backing the company further, this is contingent upon Juthica Chou being named the new CEO.Gunden expressed concerns that Miami International Holdings (MIAX), one shareholder in the company, might be attempting to take over the company, or at least acquire its regulatory licenses.Gunden said MIAX was the only shareholder invited to attend and participate in certain private board meetings, which he found problematic. Aside from board members, no other shareholders were present.Further, he alleged that a Holdings board member may be accepting “payouts for helping MIAX to complete an insider funding round.” LedgerX CFO Jennifer Liu has been kept in the dark regarding the Holdings board’s actions, he added (Liu did not immediately return CoinDesk’s request for comment).Other concerns include that the Holdings board presented “overly pessimistic” financial statements to the board of directors; that the company does not appear to be trying to raise funds outside of MIAX; and that the company is spending an extra $60,000 per month by hiring a security company.“From what I can tell, the Holdings board is engaged in grossly negligent actions towards LedgerX market participants, employees, shareholders, and perhaps even CFTC compliance requirements themselves,” he wrote.As such, many staffers are expecting the worst, Gunden wrote: “I have spoken with two current employees and learned that there is a lot of confusion and uncertainty at the company, and I’ve received reports that many employees are interviewing elsewhere in anticipation of the company shutting down.”Read the full letter below:UPDATE (Jan. 10, 18:45 UTC): This article has been updated with additional information, including the full letter.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

The service will allow institutional clients from both companies to make payments directly to one another at any time, without third parties or transaction fees. The Signet system launched in December 2018 after winning approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). It opened to Signature's commercial clients, who need a minimum account balance of $250,000, on Jan. 1, 2019. By February, the bank already claimed to have on-boarded more than 100 clients who were sending each other millions of dollars in crypto transactions daily.State-licensed trust company Prime Trust launched its settlement network back in July as an alternative to Signature. Having generally attracted an exchange clientele, including Bittrex and Huobi, it is the only publicly known financial services provider for Binance.US, Binance's American partner company.  The list of banks willing to work with cryptocurrency companies remains short over compliance and risk concerns. Hence, market share is mostly concentrated in a handful of specialized providers at which competition is heating up. The cryptocurrency exchange CEX.io, which uses Signature Bank, moved some of its retail and smaller payment operations to rival banking provider Silvergate back in November. Prime Trust dropped custodial fees to zero last January, undercutting most of its rivals that charge between four and 10 basis points per month.

Dinwiddie announced last year that he would tokenize his three-year, $34.5 million contract on the ethereum blockchain, looking to raise $13.5 million for the first year. Essentially, he’d raise his contract’s value as an upfront lump sum, with token holders receiving payouts throughout the season.The basketball league said in September that Dinwiddie’s plan was barred under the collective bargaining agreement under which NBA players operate. According to Forbes, the specific point of contention was the potential for Dinwiddie to execute an option on the third year of his contract, promising “significant dividends for investors” if he indeed opted out and signed a higher-paying contract. Dinwiddie told Forbes that removing this clause and offering a flat bond instead would allow the plan to proceed.

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 17, 2020 at 16:43 UTC","In June when Block.one, the company behind the largest initial coin offering (ICO) in history, announced its Facebook-challenging social network, Voice, it promised the blockchain would run on the EOS mainnet. Plans have changed.","Voice is meant to be a new kind of social network, one with crypto built in and one that defeats bots by verifying the identity of every single account. The company went silent about Voice for months after the summer announcement but then, in December, it revealed a launch date for Voice of Feb. 14.With this announcement came additional details, such as a frequently asked questions page on the Voice website that revealed the new application would run on a private deployment of EOSIO software. In fact, it's non-committal about ever running on EOS. The FAQ reads as follows:""While Voice is in beta and a highly iterative state, it will be run on a purpose-made EOSIO blockchain. In time, we would like Voice to leverage the EOS Public Blockchain, and potentially others that can meet the performance and governance demands of Voice.""This ran counter to an unequivocal statement in the June press announcement of Voice: ""Block.one will launch the Voice platform on the EOS Public Blockchain."" Further showing its commitment to running on EOS, Block.one reserved 3.3 million eos of RAM in late May on the mainnet.While Block.one never confirmed this, most watchers interpreted this as a stake to run the computing power behind Voice. On EOS, users lock up RAM on the blockchain in order to reserve some of the blockchain's computing power.CoinDesk asked Block.one to explain what changed between June and December, but a spokesperson declined to elaborate further.It's worth noting that Block.one builds software but other organizations run it. It created the EOSIO software and a coalition of organizations around the world launched what has come to be thought of as the EOS mainnet.By market cap, it is ranked as the eighth-biggest blockchain in the world, according to Messari, but it's not the only deployment of the open source software. Telos, Worbli and the newly launched Lynx are other deployments of the EOSIO software.Sharif Bouktila, CEO of EOS Dublin, which has served as a block producer on EOS and other EOSIO blockchains, told CoinDesk he remains longterm bullish on EOS despite the uncertainty around Block.one's biggest project since EOSIO itself.""There hasn’t been a decision that I can see but if Block.one didn’t need to use the EOS mainnet for its apps it would raise serious questions as to why and who else should use it,"" he told CoinDesk over Telegram.EOS has had performance issues that have become acute since last summer.In September, CoinDesk reported on doubts about whether the EOS blockchain is run by companies that prioritize technology over speculative profits. Then in November it became bogged down by a smart contract called EIDOS which rewarded users for making as many transactions as possible.In late November, Dan Larimer, the architect of EOSIO, delineated mistakes made in the assumptions governing applications built for EOS meant to optimize computing resource allocations. Not long after, the company announced Voice would start off on a private deployment of Larimer's software.Aaron Cox, of Greymass, which runs a back-up block producer for EOS as well as on other chains, told CoinDesk  he's come to support the decision strategically. There's competition for resources on EOS as it stands and that would be a distraction for a brand-new application taking on Facebook, one of the biggest companies in the world.""Those who invested in EOS because they heard Voice was coming to it are probably the ones who are most disappointed that it won't immediately [run on the mainnet]– but I think most who are involved in the tech side of things accept that this path forward makes some sense,"" Cox told us.Douglas Horn runs Telos, which is arguably the leading EOSIO alternative chain out there. He's optimistic Voice could be at least partially run on his chain.Horn launched Telos with a copy of the EOS genesis block, but one that capped token allocations for each account in order to prevent domination by whales. He noted that Block.one finally claimed its allocation on the chain last year, suggesting it might be interested in running applications there.""There’s no strong indication of what their plans are exactly, but if they are looking for a public EOSIO chain to integrate with Voice I expect Telos would be their top choice,"" he wrote.One ICO investor who had grown dissatisfied with Block.one last year and has come around in recent months, Shane Calfee, believes Voice will take advantage of multiple EOSIO blockchains to the benefit of all users. “This will more than likely be the beginnings of IBC (inter-blockchain communication), which is the holy grail of the blockchain world,"" he said.But there's no guarantee Voice will ever run on anyone's chain but Block.one's. The language from the FAQ is non-committal, as multiple sources pointed out including EOS Dublin’s Bouktila, who noted there's no way for anyone to know what Block.one will do. ""I'm hopeful that Voice could be a bridge from EOS to some of the other chains and projects, but the reality is we are all in 'wait and see' mode,"" he said.

in 2017 set up one of the sector's first index funds (the Bitcoin ...","Jan 21, 2020 at 10:00 UTC",Noelle Acheson is CoinDesk’s Director of Research and producer of CoinDesk’s Institutional Crypto newsletter. These opinions are her own. ,"Let’s talk about containers – not the massive cargo ships that cross oceans but vessels such as bottles, boxes and bins. Things that hold stuff. A reliable container does just that, it holds. It doesn’t transform its contents.In finance, the vessel is the custody service that stores a fund’s assets. A good custody service reliably “holds” securities and bonds in its client’s name, often providing additional services but never influencing the value of the asset.Cryptocurrency markets are different. Good crypto custody services can have a material impact on an asset’s market price, even going as far as affecting its fundamental value.This difference is more significant than it may initially seem. In traditional finance, custodians are a key piece of the puzzle but they are not market influencers. In crypto, their strategies – individual or collective – can shape an asset’s success. Yet, this influence is unmonitored and unregulated, and could end up giving birth to an entirely new power structure.Let’s look at an example. Crypto asset manager Bitwise, which in 2017 set up one of the sector’s first index funds (the Bitcoin 10 Private Index Fund), revealed in its recent investor letter that it has updated its index methodology.Previously, for an asset to be eligible for inclusion in the underlying Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, it had only to be able to be custodied in cold storage (offline wallets, out of the potential reach of hackers). Now, eligible assets must instead be held by a regulated custodian.This sounds fair: Custody, especially given the bearer nature of crypto assets, is a complex yet crucial aspect of investment management. With the sector’s endemic security risks, shifting the emphasis to regulated custodians seems like a move towards best practices and greater oversight. All good.Now, let’s look closer. This rule change triggered a change to the index composition. Monero (XMR) leaves, as the privacy coin is not held by any regulated custodian, to be replaced by chainlink (LINK).However sensible the index criteria change may seem, here we have custodial practices determining institutional interest in an asset. Sure, it’s understandable custodians may shy away from privacy coins due to regulatory uncertainty. It’s also understandable institutions prefer professional services over the hassle of self-custody. But inclusion in or exclusion from leading index funds is likely to have a material impact on an asset’s price outlook.  Corporate decisions of market infrastructure participants are playing an important role in this.Going further, the Bitwise investor newsletter also explains the fund has liquidated its position in cardano (ADA), even though the token qualifies for the index, because it isn’t supported by the fund’s custodian, Coinbase Custody.Now, it is a fund manager’s prerogative to adjust the composition of funds. But here again is an example of the influence custodians can have on asset prices. Should Coinbase Custody decide in the near future to support ADA, would it then be included in affected funds? Should this potential, which depends on the decisions of a single custodian, be considered part of the value proposition of ADA?Another example: staking as a service. A growing number of custodians are offering services for tokens that can earn income by participating in governance mechanisms known as “staking,” in which token holders receive compensation for using their position to support the operation of a network. Many clients are attracted by the additional return but prefer to not deal with the complexity of the process, even if that means taking a haircut.These clients, often institutional, are likely to limit their investment choices to “convenient” staking options – in other words, to the tokens custodians’ staking services choose to support. Again, custodians shape investors’ choices, which in turn affects the market value of assets.True, banks today do not offer interest on all types of currency deposits. But the liquidity of foreign exchange markets and the breadth of interest-bearing options elsewhere mean an individual bank’s strategy is unlikely to have a material impact.Given the youth of crypto markets, however, and the relatively limited range of regulated custodians (for now), institutional investors do not have the same scale of selection. Assets are less resilient to the impact custodians’ choices can have.In traditional markets, large custodians don’t get involved in asset selection. They leave that to investors. Traditional custodians do not have to make calls on which assets to support based on technological considerations. Moving beyond infrastructure considerations, market philosophy has at its root the idea that a supposedly level playing field allows for a fair determination of asset price. In crypto markets, the playing field is anything but level.When market infrastructure participants such as custodians have a significant influence on current and potential market values, a new type of power structure emerges.Going forward, increased competition could lessen the impact. But recently there has been much talk of impending sector consolidation, which could end up having the opposite effect.This highlights a fundamental shift in the crypto market ethos. Crypto assets were designed to not need centralized custody. Yet, we now have centralized custodians wielding increasing power in the sector’s evolution.I’m not saying this is bad, nor am I saying it is good. I am saying it is something we should be aware of and keep an eye on. Sprawling systems tend to evolve organically, and it is so easy to wake up one day and realize that it has evolved into a structure with more risk than efficiency.We’ve seen this before: The decentralization promise of the early internet evolved into a centralized infrastructure with alarming secondary effects because most of us choose convenience over resilience.We could be in danger of making the same mistake, only this time it is not just our information at risk. This time we’re talking about a market that can shape wealth and move money – a relatively small market for now, yes, but one that is seeping into mainstream portfolios and is likely to end up having a significant impact on finance more broadly. Convenience is good, as is the sector’s increasing market professionalization and oversight. But you know the saying: “Be careful what you wish for.”Disclosure: The author owns small amounts of bitcoin and ether.For an overview on crypto custody, download our free introductory report!The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

However, changes to its business structure have prompted a number of major carriers to come aboard in the last year. The platform now has more than 100 participants – including five of the six largest container shipping firms as well as port operators and regulators – and is processing over “10 million discrete shipping events and thousands of documents each week,” according to previous statements from Maersk.Last August, Thailand's customs agency was reported to be integrating with TradeLens to streamline its shipment tracking procedures.The project also received an antitrust exemption from the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission.

Obviously, everybody is here,"" DiPrisco told CoinDesk. In other words, CES is the kind of place where the MakerDAO Foundation is able to meet executives that would otherwise be hard to reach.MakerDAO is a protocol that allows people to stake ethereum and borrow a portion of its value in DAI, a token designed to maintain its value at parity with the U.S. dollar. There is $376 million in ETH locked in MakerDAO right now, according to DeFi Pulse.It's worth noting that right now there are two kinds of DAI in existence as the community transitions to multi-collateral DAI.As one example of the kinds of companies the MakerDAO Foundation is trying to reach in Las Vegas, DiPrisco said he had a conversation with someone setting up an online bank in the Philippines.""We could make great alternative infrastructure to the legacy banking system in the country,"" he said. The most obvious benefit, according to DiPrisco, is that the bank could offer a much higher savings rate on deposits. MakerDAO’s governance-token holders voted to raise the DAI Savings Rate to 6 percent on Wednesday, up from the previous 4 percent.More broadly, DiPrisco said, ""We're going to try to meet people at this conference who can offer access to the DAI Savings Rate through their distribution channels.""Steve Becker, chief operating officer at the MakerDAO Foundation, said that when he asks people if they trust their bank, they tell him they don't really have a choice in the matter. When he tells them that decentralization gives them another option, he said he tells them:""'You have sovereignty over your own money, what do you think about that?' It takes a while to think about it and ask, 'What does that really mean to me?' It means that if your bank fails, your money still stays pretty safe.""Becker said MakerDAO came to CES because it is focused on finding where crypto derives its value. ""For us the value is in the intersection of the blockchain world with the analog world,"" Becker said.On the show floor, MakerDAO staff are talking to people about how DAI is actually usable.For example, the company is showing off its integration with Pundi X, which makes a special card and point-of-sale system that allows users to pay merchants directly in DAI, without any conversion to fiat. These units, DiPrisco said, have mostly been taken up in developing-world countries with unstable fiat currencies.More salient to an American audience, MakerDAO staffers are showing off their recent integration with the OKEx crypto exchange. The exchange is running a promotion right now where DAI holders can earn an extra 1 percent on their DAI holdings.MakerDAO introduced the DAI Savings Rate in November. Holders who choose to stake their DAI can earn a portion of the “stability fee” that borrowers pay, earning a much higher return than they would on fiat savings in a U.S. bank, for example.""We just haven't seen these kinds of returns on U.S.-dollar-based deposits in this decade,"" DiPrisco said.As to the reception he’s faced at the MakerDAO booth, DiPrisco said it’s been generally positive.""I haven't seen anybody say, ‘I'm going to go to the bank and take out all my money,’ but I do think they are pleasantly surprised to hear about it,” he said. “I think it's really the first time we're interfacing with this crowd and it's very new to them, so I think they need a little time to digest."" The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

A cold wallet the size of two credit cards back to back that features an e-ink screen and fingerprint-based security.,"The thin plastic wallet uses biometrics to temporarily unlock the device in order to display a QR code for deposits along with current crypto balances. The device comes with a USB ""case"" that allows a person to connect it to a computer as well as low-energy Bluetooth support for syncing with iOS and Android devices.The device, called the AT.Wallet, will be available in the U.S. in February, said Vice President Zake Huang.AuthenTrend makes devices for bank security and this is its first cold crypto wallet. The device holds private keys and includes a 24-word mnemonic recovery system. Huang said the company would support ""bitcoin, bitcoin cash and ethereum"" and can add other currencies such as ripple in the future. You can view wallet balances on the screen by pushing a button on the back of the device.It's difficult to test the security of this kind of wallet without tearing it apart but the ""public"" functions – namely the e-ink screen – are designed to offer as low an attack surface as possible. Without the app, the device can only display basic information about your wallet, including balance, and only when you activate the biometrics. The device is new and is currently being tested with customers, so you probably shouldn't put your entire BTC hoard onto this thing.Given its size and battery life, however, I suspect this might be a good ""walking around"" wallet for those who want to stick something into their real, physical wallet. Like Bobby Lee's Ballet card, portability and usability are key here. The AT.Wallet still has a way to go – the app crashed multiple times on enrollment – but the form factor and biometrics make it a competitor to the EAL5+ security chip-powered D'CENT Biometric Wallet and the card-like CoolWallet S. The company is working on desktop versions of the software.Huang didn't offer pricing for the device and said the company is planning to sell it primarily on Amazon.

The platform uses technology said to ensure traders get the best prices available. The firm earns revenue by taking a spread from orders executed at levels better than quoted at order submission.Ehrlich, who used to be the CEO of E*Trade, founded Voyager with Oscar Salazar, the former CTO of Uber, in the summer of 2018. The broker began offering interest on 3 percent APR on bitcoin last November, following its acquisition of wallet startup Ethos earlier that year. “Voyager customers will also be able to earn interest on these stablecoins, giving them another way to grow wealth in the crypto industry,” said Ehrlich. Deposits and withdrawals for all three stablecoins opened earlier Wednesday, with interest-earning beginning Feb. 1. The brokerage firm took the unusual step of a reverse merger in 2019, purchasing the majority of shares in a publicly traded company – in this case, a defunct mining exploration company – and combining in order to become listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. By becoming a listed company, Voyager now makes quarterly and annual disclosures of its financials and answers to the Canadian securities regulator. That can help build trust with traders, according to Ehrlich, who said there was ""an increase in demand for users looking for new, secure platforms to buy and trade crypto assets.""The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

PoolTogether’s DAI pool also hit $1 million in locked-in crypto for the first time Friday. Reflecting that success, the company is announcing a $1.05 million investment round under a simple agreement for future equity. IDEO CoLab Ventures led the round; ConsenSys and DTC Capital also invested.""Our goal is expanding access to the prize-linked savings protocol,"" Leighton Cusack, the project's founder, told CoinDesk in an email. ""Our hope is that others will begin building on top of the protocol to expand access to a financial primitive we believe has been overlooked thus far in DeFi.""Cusack described PoolTogether as a bet on ethereum's promise. ""We think the 'last mile' infrastructure on ethereum is finally getting to the point where mainstream users can be on-boarded and we're excited to leverage all the tools the ethereum ecosystem has to offer,"" Cusack said.PoolTogether players sacrifice interest they could have earned on holdings of the stablecoin DAI in exchange for a shot at winning the interest of everyone else in the pool. All the money placed in PoolTogether goes into the Compound protocol where borrowers pay for access to it. The current yield on DAI placed in Compound is 7.81 percent, as of Monday morning. PoolTogether is attractive to savers for two reasons: because they don't put their principal at risk and because a large portion of the pool is sponsored. Some of the sponsored money comes from PoolTogether and some comes from other organizations that want to encourage participation in the networks the project touches. In the current pool, about a quarter of the $1,000,000 pool is sponsored, and therefore out of the running for prizes. That chunk of crypto still feeds interest into the prize pot, however, adding to the project’s appeal.In short, PoolTogether offers a simple way to gamify savings and make it slightly more fun, though there is the very real risk of never winning and merely losing out on the all-but-guaranteed yield from placing your DAI in Compound directly. For small users, though, this yield is negligible. “We initially became interested in PoolTogether because we found the concept of a global Prized Linked Savings protocol to be both highly compelling as well as something that is uniquely enabled by blockchain technology,” Dan Elitzer, an investor at IDEO CoLab Ventures, told CoinDesk. “We were impressed that even with a very early-stage prototype and the friction of needing to first purchase both ETH and DAI, then send them to a non-custodial wallet like Metamask, they were managing to attract new users into the ecosystem.”PoolTogether has been experiencing strong growth since its first pool, though it did see a hiccup as MakerDAO made the switch to multi-collateral DAI last November. (Users had to actively switch over to new currency. There are still a tiny number of users in the pool for single-collateral DAI.)""We've always felt getting the weekly prize over $1,000 would be a big psychological barrier,"" Cusack wrote. ""The next target we're shooting for is $10,000 prize and we think that will be another big inflection.""PoolTogether recently updated its business model so that it no longer holds 10 percent of each winning pool, as we previously reported. Cusack told CoinDesk the project is now exploring new business models based on its current growth trajectory.""PoolTogether is a unique company that enables entrenched behavior using new crypto primitives and provides a foundation for the emergence of new behavior as a result,"" Min Teo, an investment partner at ConsenSys Labs, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""ConsenSys is excited to support PoolTogether in their work to decentralize the protocol and increase access to this innovative new savings tool.""With its success so far with DAI, PoolTogether is bringing a new product onto the market: a daily prize powered by USDC, the fiat-backed stablecoin created by Circle and Coinbase.""Daily prizes mean you have a higher chance to win over a period of time so it's more favorable to small depositors,"" Cusack explained.USDC earns 3.91 percent on Compound as of Monday morning. To incentivize players, PoolTogether will seed the new pool with $100,000 worth of USDC that is not eligible for winning. Early entrants likely will have an outsized shot at winning interest on that pile of crypto.The new daily pool is live now and the first payout will be tomorrow afternoon. PoolTogether went with USDC because it's the only other stablecoin live on Compound as of now. ""Ultimately, our goal is that the pools will support multiple stablecoin types in the same pool but the protocol is not there yet,"" Cusack said. Disclosure: This reporter has experimented with PoolTogether and currently has fewer than 100 tickets in the DAI pool.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

exchanges simply self-insure, holding large amounts of bitcoin locked up 
for ...","Jan 13, 2020 at 17:57 UTC",The Takeaway:,"An insurance company saying it hopes to pay a sizable claim sounds like a turkey looking forward to Christmas.But that’s exactly what James Croome, fine art and specie underwriter at Arch Insurance International, says he wants his firm to do. Just to show that it can. Arch is one of the few underwriters willing to insure cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians against the theft or loss of customer funds. London-based Arch Insurance International, which works with a number of big-name brokers offering crypto cover, has yet to pay out for any losses in this relatively new market. If someone does manage to pull off a heist of cryptographic keys kept offline in cold storage, Arch will get a chance to demonstrate it’s good for the money, said Croome, who works out of London. “I would like there to be a containable but sizable loss,” he said. “Because that would give evidence to our potential clients as to the service we can provide, the speed at which we will pay the claims and remind people who have bought coverage that it does work appropriately.”Insurers have years of experience in covering specialized assets in the traditional world, whether that's fine art or the regulatory requirements to protect financial services firms. But they feel less secure with crypto because there is a shortage of data for firms to model policy rates. In response to this, Croome helped create a consortium, including mega-broker Marsh and global law firm Norton Rose Fulbright, to offer cold storage cover for crypto assets. Released in September, Blue Vault, which is solely owned by Arch, provides limits of up to $150 million and covers the loss of digital assets due to internal and external theft (via direct access to the storage media as opposed to remote hacking attacks) and including employee collusion. Blue Vault also covers physical damage or destruction of private keys from fires, floods, earthquakes and other catastrophic events.Ankur Kacker, vice president and specie expert on Marsh's Digital Asset Risk Transfer (DART) team, said: “We have placed four policies for Blue Vault as of now, all in the last seven months.”Marsh, the world’s largest insurance broker, recently announced a deal with Ledger Vault, the institution-focused arm of Ledger, the well-known hardware wallet provider for $150 million cold storage cover; Marsh is working in a similar way with crypto custodian KNOX.  Arch chose to work with law firm Norton Rose Fulbright on the crypto policy because it wanted precise policy wording. Ambiguous language is a pet peeve of Croome’s.“My biggest annoyance with the specie market is the existence of ambiguous wordings, which is why I chose to work with a legal firm with a track record in this space,” he said. Norton Rose Fulbright has given presentations in New York, Bermuda and to the London Market to help “educate insurance markets and develop set the market and standards for cold storage of these assets,” said Nicholas Berry, a partner at the law firm. The firm also helped Lloyd’s of London with its market guidance on underwriting digital assets.Norton Rose Fulbright enlisted the help of Peter McBurney, Professor of Computer Science, King’s College London and a consultant with the law firm, to spell out technical aspects of key management and crypto storage and create appropriate policy wording. This is an instance where the London Market has led other international markets, said Berry. “Going back to 2018, there has been a mismatch between supply in terms of underwriting capacity and demand for those wanting cold storage or even hot crime-type cover. Some of the big brokers have been pushing the supply side to provide more cover in terms of higher limits, wider cover,” he said.Crypto insurance is widely seen as a prerequisite for greater institutional involvement in the market. But Croome is wary of companies offering insurance policies as a marketing ploy.“We tend not to look at insureds that are looking for a chicken-egg scenario. They feel they don’t have a current revenue stream but are hoping the existence of insurance will help speed up the point at which assets come into custody and therefore increase their revenue,” he said.As well as Marsh, Arch has been working with Aon, the number two broker by size. Other brokers known to be exploring crypto include Arthur J. Gallagher and Paragon.But Croome says that for now he is shying away from really broadening out his broker network for crypto. “I think I will keep to the ones that have shown comprehension of that which we like. They understand that and therefore they can filter out the sort of things we seek to avoid,” said Croome. Insurance companies like Arch bring in third party specialists to examine physical vault security and do the same to understand and communicate the risks around the storage of crypto. “I wouldn't consider myself capable of valuing a Dutch master [painting], knowing if it was genuine or a fake.That's not my job,” said Croome.Peter McBurney, who divides his time between academia and advising Norton Rose Fulbright’s clients on technology matters, does the equivalent of physical vault checking for the IT system that would create and store the private keys.McBurney estimates there are still reasonably few policies written in London covering crypto cold storage, and the same in New York, although this number is increasing. “It’s still very early days, it is almost virgin territory.”McBurney said ultra-high net worth individuals or hedge funds who already have relationships with custodians for storage of fine art or gold bullion are driving the market for crypto insurance. “They are going to their existing physical custodians and saying, 'Can you also store our private keys?' So the custodians are going to insurers and saying, 'Can you insure us to store these private keys?' and that's where a lot of the business has originated. It's customer-driven from the individuals and the hedge funds who have large crypto holdings,” he said.Lloyd’s of London, the centuries-old insurance market, has realized there are new revenue streams to be had with crypto. Its underwriters have launched the Product Innovation Facility, which spans some 24 markets and has over $100 million of capacity. The facility includes a crypto subgroup, where Marsh has a representative.A spokesman for Lloyd’s said it’s too early for any on-record comment from the crypto subcommittee at this time. Marsh also did not comment on the group’s purview. The group will likely be looking beyond cold storage to include crime bond markets; E&O (Errors and Omissions) insurance; D&O (Directors and Officers) and a general smorgasbord of potential product offerings to the digital assets world, according to sources close to the Lloyd’s market. The risk relating to crypto held on exchanges and in wallets connected to the internet is a very different animal from vaulted cold storage.To deal with losses from third-party hacks, most of the large crypto exchanges simply self-insure, holding large amounts of bitcoin locked up for such occasions. Having battled it out in the market for some years, people like Binance chief “CZ” Changpeng Zhao or Kraken CEO Jesse Powell see insurance for hot wallets as a fundamentally flawed concept.Arch is not looking to enter the hot wallet space any time soon. However, Croome said he can see ways the crime market could interplay with the specie world.“We will often take an excess layer, the larger chunk of capacity above the crime policy, to very high exposures but on a much tighter coverage. They will take much broader coverage with much smaller limits,” he said. Marsh’s Digital Asset Risk Transfer team has clearly been pursuing its own plans regarding a hot wallet product. Quizzed on the subject of hot wallet coverage, Kacker said: “At this point in time, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag. But I can say it's in the pipeline.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Justin Sun, Tron Foundation’s 29-year-old founder and CEO, and Cong Li, 37, the head of engineering, are named together with the companies as defendants in the lawsuit, made public last week.According to the lawsuit, Sun berated Hall with derogatory exclamations to pressure him into fast-tracking BitTorrent software releases. On other occasions, Juraszek claimed, Sun slapped Li and was never disciplined for it, and Li appeared to have physically hit a manager whom he allegedly had a pattern of verbally attacking in person and in group chats.“Lukasz Juraszek saw two sets of shoes under the conference room door,” the lawsuit said, referring to Li and the manager, “and then heard a loud commotion coming from the room and then what seemed like a punch, slap or a strike of a hand.” After Li opened the door to leave the room, Juraszek saw the manager’s “face was red, his eyes glossy.”The lawsuit also highlights the ethical dilemmas confronting cryptocurrency professionals working on technology touted as value-neutral that can be used to break laws. Hall said he flagged the risks of third parties hosting copyright-infringing content and child pornography, but Sun and Li cared little about his proposal to retain lawyers to review the Tron Foundation’s BitTorrent updates.“Cong Li summarily dismissed these concerns, stated that he had discussed these concerns with Justin Sun, and that no legal review would be done,” the lawsuit said.The lawsuit is pursuing $15 million in damages and government action against claims of labor law violations, on grounds of wrongful termination, discrimination, emotional distress and hostile work conditions. A response submitted to the court in December by the Tron Foundation, BitTorrent, Sun and Li contested the charges’ motivations, jurisdiction and factual substance.In a statement from a spokesperson, Sun and Li said: “Tron is not able to speak on the details of pending litigation, but what we can tell you is that our customers, employees and the Tron community are extremely important to us.”After the conference room incident, the manager informed Juraszek that Li schemed to “hold him to impossibly high engineering standards” and boot him from the company for reporting what he observed to human resources, the lawsuit said. Then, Juraszek claimed, unknown users logged in under his work computer’s ID from another location and his emails disappeared.Hall, who said sabotage also extended to him, claimed Li threatened to fire him if he took a vacation that had already been approved in writing under company policy, instead of canceling the travel without seeking a contractually guaranteed reimbursement.Choosing to go on vacation anyway, Hall upon his return was demoted by Li, who tried to deter him from documenting their verbal conversations in emails, making such threats as, “If you go tighter with me, I will go tighter with you,” “things will end badly for you,” and “I cannot protect you,” according to the lawsuit.Their eventual firings, they argued, amounted to cases of retaliation and discrimination. The lawsuit, and the complaints to a California employment board that greenlighted it, said the plaintiffs never fared poorly on job evaluations — Juraszek claimed he was even promoted at a higher salary prior to the conflicts — and that mainland Chinese hires came to replace them and other domestic employees. Sun and Li are Chinese nationals.To Hall and Juraszek, the new recruits from China seemed prone to being steered into behaving less responsively toward American laws and customs than they would have, giving Sun the upper hand to enforce a “9-9-6” Chinese office schedule — 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 6 days a week — and brush off unlawful BitTorrent material, the lawsuit said.Juraszek’s own investigation surfaced pirated movies on a BitTorrent website, said the lawsuit, which recalled that even when told about the risks, Sun pushed forward to keep up with deadlines, and that the manager told Juraszek that Li lied to his team about obtaining go-ahead from corporate counsel.BitTorrent has dealt with recurring copyright lawsuits and law enforcement investigations since it opened at the turn of the century as an environment to freely download books, music, television shows and movies.Hall, a product director, lasted seven months until June at the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent. Juraszek, a software engineer, started in February and ended in August.Neither Juraszek nor the lawyers for either side answered requests for comment by press time. Hall declined to comment. The court case throws Sun deeper into the fray of mounting scrutiny over his cryptocurrency businesses. Well in advance of the Tron cryptocurrency’s circulation, traders uncovered paragraphs in the Tron white paper — a document laying out its blockchain model — that had been lifted verbatim from other cryptocurrency white papers. Sun chalked it up to unknowing volunteers with purported translation difficulties.Zhiqiang Chen, Tron Foundation’s first CTO, who left to spin up a Tron competitor, would find himself in May denying Sun’s accusations he had been fired for embezzlement, bribery, non-disclosure violations and trade theft. Sparking the fight was Chen’s now-deleted blog post communicating worries that Sun and the Tron Foundation could override the Tron blockchain.In the aftermath of the Tron Foundation’s takeover a year earlier, BitTorrent was plagued with resignations by employees who echoed that Sun exaggerated their technology’s promise and accessed too many Tron nodes, points of power in the Tron blockchain that affect its cryptocurrencies’ prices. Winners of Tron contests and sweepstakes have also faulted Sun for discrepancies in how prizes have been advertised and received.Jared Tate, the creator of the Digibyte virtual currency, also known as DGB, blamed related broadsides he personally lobbed at the Tron Foundation in December as the reason for his token’s delisting on Poloniex, a cryptocurrency exchange Sun bought with a group of investors in the fall.Most conspicuously, amid reports the Chinese government had placed him on a travel ban on suspicions of illegal financial dealings, Sun took to Chinese social media network Weibo in July to publicly apologize to Chinese state officials for flaunting his winning $4.6 million bid on a charity lunch with Warren Buffett.Sun postponed the lunch but was spotted at a Tron event on the same day. The Tron Foundation, whose official Weibo account was suspended in November during a government crackdown on cryptocurrencies, had claimed he needed to recover from a bout of kidney stones.Staffed in Beijing and San Francisco, the Tron Foundation is a Singapore non-profit that supports the development of the Tron blockchain and its add-on features: a digital platform for mobile and web utilities such as entertainment, gambling and gaming that are available in Samsung’s blockchain store, and a network for different cryptocurrencies including bitcoin-dollar peg Tether and TRX, the Tron cryptocurrency.BitTorrent under Tron’s management facilitates BitTorrent token, BTT, payments to send and receive files or buy faster download times. TRX, traded between less than one cent and 20 cents over the past three years, has fallen from a peak market capitalization of $13 billion to $1 billion today.Read the full complaint and Tron's responses below.

","The Digital Chamber submitted an amicus curiae brief – a filing made by someone who is not a party in the litigation – in Telegram’s ongoing fight in court with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged the messenger platform violated securities law during its $1.7 billion ICO. The chamber urges the SEC to draw a clear line between investment contracts in general, which are treated as a security under federal law, and digital assets.""Without a clear legal distinction between a transaction determined to be an investment contract and the digital asset that is the subject of the investment contract, these software developers, retailers, healthcare providers, advertising companies, and others may not be able to develop or use blockchain technology without unintentionally triggering the U.S. federal securities laws every time a digital asset is used as part of their network,"" the brief says.The chamber does not have a view on whether the sale of grams, Telegram's token, is a securities transaction, it added. Rather, the group's interest is ""in ensuring that the legal framework applied to digital assets underlying an investment contract is clear and consistent.""Telegram is scheduled to meet the SEC in court on Feb. 18 and 19 to discuss whether grams are securities. The brief was written by Lilya Tessler, the New York head of the FinTech and Blockchain group at Sidley Austin law firm. The argument echoes Telegram's own response to the SEC's allegations, which insists that while the purchase agreements for the tokens were securities, grams themselves, once issued, will be utility tokens to be used in its new proof-of-stake blockchain.“In Howey, specific orange groves sold pursuant to an investment contract were not themselves securities. On the premise that a digital asset that is the subject of an investment contract is not necessarily a security itself, the asset (a commodity) may simply be the subject of an ordinary commercial transaction,” the brief says, referencing the famous Supreme Court case often used to determine whether an investment is a security.The brief warns that deeming any digital assets securities for the sole reason of being recorded digitally could mean “the companies operating these systems may need to become registered broker-dealers or another type of regulated financial institution or worse, subject to severe enforcement action.” This, in turn, can push innovative businesses out of the U.S., the brief said.“Like so many other types of assets (which will often be commodities), digital assets may be the subject of an investment contract without being a security,” the brief says, hinting that grams might not be unregistered securities, as the SEC believes, but a digital commodity. The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Liat Shetret, head of policy and research at London-based crypto forensics firm Elliptic, is scheduled to testify at the hearing. Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk that cryptocurrency and the dark web are two such areas the House commission will examine.Shetret is expected to explain how current tools can help law enforcement agents track illicit cryptocurrency payments. Elliptic tells CoinDesk the U.S. can play a leadership role in creating new regulations – or supporting the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – around the global use of cryptocurrencies.One recommendation Shetret is slated to submit: Exchanges using privacy coins should be subject to strict AML rules.Previous testimony on human trafficking has been critical of cryptocurrencies’ role, driving recommendations that Congress increase regulatory oversight of the industry, Robinson said. “What I want to do is put cryptocurrency usage in some context and say … the availability of blockchain analysis has been successful in curbing illegal use of cryptocurrency,” he said.Indeed, fellow crypto analytics startup Chainalysis announced inOctober  it had worked with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to trace bitcoin transactions associated with the web’s largest child porn site. The DOJ arrested or indicted nearly 40 individuals, several of whom were traced through their bitcoin use. While a large number of crypto transactions can be traced, privacy coins are an exception. To that end, Shetret’s prepared remarks, which were shared with CoinDesk, will recommend Congress and regulators develop new guidance for banks and crypto exchanges on how to approach privacy coins and the individuals who trade them.“We respect every individual’s right to financial privacy, and privacy coins have societal value,” Shetret’s testimony says, citing people living under authoritarian regimes. Still, privacy coins are being used by criminals, and most dark web marketplaces currently accept these cryptocurrencies, she said. “Regulators should ensure that cryptocurrency businesses that support privacy coins enforce anti-money laundering policies that are appropriate to the lack of traceability inherent to them,” she said.As part of this, Shetret calls for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury Department’s money laundering monitor, to issue guidance specifically detailing how privacy coins should be treated.Shetret told CoinDesk in a phone call that Congress should be commended for looking at cryptocurrencies, but the U.S. government and financial institutions should fully grapple with crypto’s incumbent risks.“There’s a big role that banks generally, financial institutions need to understand their own role and exposure to crypto, and law enforcement needs to understand their transaction monitoring,” Shetret said. “We can’t just talk about it in a vacuum.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Thursday’s sentencing caps McDonnell’s back-to-back legal fights with the federal government, which saw the 47-year-old New York resident in civil and then criminal court on fraud charges. He pleaded guilty in June 2019, a press release stated.Both cases stemmed from his tenure as CabbageTech CEO, where he defrauded victims of over $200,000, according to prosecutors. Thursday's release claimed he stole bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum and verge from 10 victims under the alter-ego “Jason Flack.” New victims were solicited on social media. While McDonnell promised investors would profit, he instead provided false financial statements, prosecutors sai. The CabbageTech platform started in May 2016, according to prosecutors. By 2018 the government was taking notice.That January, the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil suit against McDonnell, accusing him of defrauding investors. It based its right to enforce on a 2014 Internal Revenue Service ruling that bitcoin and other “convertible virtual currencies” are commodities. This definition had never been tested in court before but a judge soon ruled in the CFTC’s favor, creating a precedent for the IRS rule and bolstering the regulator’s subsequent enforcement actions across the space. McDonnell was eventually ordered to pay $1.1 million.The Justice Department followed with criminal action. It was assisted by the CFTC’s previous work and secured a guilty plea from McDonnell in June 2019, according to a press release. “This office will continue to vigorously prosecute white-collar criminals who defraud the investing public,” Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement Thursday.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Sumedha Deshmukh is a Project Specialist on the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology team at the World Economic Forum. The opinions expressed here are their own.,"If the last few years have taught us one thing, it’s this: Users are not magically protected as technology evolves. Rather, user protection is something that occurs as the result of intention, commitment and deliberate design. Without this dedication from the outset, the trajectory of a technology’s development can, and often does, carry significant and far-reaching consequences.As blockchain pursuits move from buzzword to business case, the technology is fast approaching an inflection point. With $12.4 billion in projected spending by 2022 and high-profile announcements from actors like Facebook, central banks and global mining and metals companies, the decisions made by builders today will have ripple effects on significant swaths of the population for years to come.In fact, blockchain has already experienced the consequences of not designing with the rights of users in mind. In 2017 and 2018, the sudden rise and subsequent fall of initial coin offerings (ICO) provided a case study of what can go wrong with instances of fraud, unsustainable business models and significant losses to non-savvy consumers. For example, one 2018 study identified more than 80 percent of ICOs conducted in 2017 as scams.This potential for misuse caught the attention of legislators and policymakers, but in many instances it was too late. If blockchain is truly looking to scale in its next phase, repeating these mistakes is not an option.This new wave of development offers an opportunity to correct course. However, if organizations in a rush to act first don’t learn from the past, the technology faces several existential threats:Risks to users. The world has learned the hard way that bottom-line protections for users need to be considered at the outset of product design, especially when it comes to data. Blockchain’s properties as a foundational technology make these considerations particularly important, given the harm and follow-on effects that can come from potential breaches.Potential for transformational change can be undermined. Those with sophisticated knowledge may have the opportunity to exploit their advantages – whether to intentionally harm consumers or to suppress the market through anti-competitive actions. This behavior weakens the very premise of decentralization, which was initiated to provide censorship-resistance, privacy and a level playing field for entrants.Widening existing gaps. Transformation is most likely to happen in places that can leapfrog, like high-growth economies. Despite talk of the potential for financial inclusion, if not designed carefully, blockchain can lead to the further exclusion and exploitation of vulnerable populations.As with any technology, the ultimate promises and perils of blockchain technology will come down to individual decisions made across its strategy, development and implementation. It’s impossible to control all these design choices but there is still room for alignment among key players on what the minimum standards for the technology should be.That’s why the World Economic Forum’s Global Blockchain Council is creating a “Blockchain Bill of Rights: Design Principles for a Decentralized Future.” The document has been co-designed by some of the foremost leaders in the space.The goal is to align private-sector leaders, policymakers and consumers in a fundamental vision of how users can and should be protected as blockchain technology develops, particularly around the following pillars:Acting now, we hope to enable citizens, policymakers and technology users to leverage these principles as they seek to bring greater accountability to the systems that power our societies.An initial draft of the Blockchain Bill of Rights will be tested at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, from Jan. 21-24, 2020. Over the course of the year, the Council will solicit input into the document via roundtables and interviews.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Mainnet ONE holders will soon be able to stake their coins to earn rewards and gain access to our secure, fast and low-cost blockchain,"" Nick White, a Harmony co-founder, told CoinDesk via email. Harmony is a proof-of-stake blockchain that uses sharding with the aim of reaching extremely fast, large-scale settlement for millions of users. It raised $18 million in a token sale to strategic investors last year, followed by an initial exchange offering on the Binance Launchpad in May, selling an additional $5 million worth of tokens. For users of certain exchanges, this swap will be automatic. According to a source familiar with the matter, most ONE tokens already sit on exchanges.Unlike some prior token swaps, such as EOS, there's not a way for users to manually conduct the swap. Holders of either of the tokens will need to load them onto an exchange participating in a bridge with Harmony. Once on such an exchange, the tokens can then be withdrawn, but they will only return as the ONE native coin. Token swaps were a major theme of 2018 coming out the initial coin offering boom, but they've been less common as more companies have shied away from selling cryptocurrency ahead of their functionality. According to a Harmony spokesperson, only Bitmax currently has the swap live as of this writing. Binance should be operating the swap as of Feb. 3.The announcement also indicates other partners will enable the swap soon, including HonestMining (a staking service), and exchanges including Huobi, Gate.io and Kucoin. Holders will be able to earn additional ONE coins by staking, but they will need the native version to do so.Harmony has also integrated with several hardware wallets for storage offline, such as Ledger and SafePal.The Harmony network is live now, though not all the features are. For example, validating nodes remain permissioned, but this will eventually become open. Validators will be rewarded with new ONE tokens in reward for securing the network, under Harmony's proof-of-stake system. Harmony had a pre-mine of 12.6 billion ONE tokens issued on the ethereum and binance chains, 36.9 percent of which was sold in the seed and launchpad sale. The company has not yet announced whether or not there will be a deadline to make the swap.The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.

Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 30, 2020 at 12:00 UTC",Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang said the U.S. needs a consistent legal framework for cryptocurrencies if it is to be a market leader.,"Speaking to Bloomberg on Thursday, Yang said the current regulatory situation is confusing and potentially harmful to individuals and businesses working in the space. ""Right now we're stuck with this hodgepodge of state-by-state treatments and it's bad for everybody. It's bad for innovators who want to invest in the space,"" he said. ""The underlying technology of cryptocurrencies is very, very high potential and we should be investing in it,"" Yang continued. ""We need to have a uniform set of rules and regulations around cryptocurrency use nationwide.""The U.S., as a country, does not have a clear legal framework for cryptocurrencies. While some states, such as New York, have created a licensing framework for crypto businesses, most regulators rely on a combination of decades-old judicial precedents, international conventions and occasional guidance from federal regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified all initial coin offerings (ICOs), regardless of a token's nature, as securities sales based on a precedent from a 1940s ruling over a Floridian orange farmer. Despite issuing updated guidance for cryptocurrencies last year, legal experts have criticized the regulator for underspecifying key areas such as failing to define what an ""active participant"" in a token sale really is. The regulatory status quo has also created conflicting guidance. In 2018, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a letter stating that token issuers were money transmitters and required to comply with existing regulation. The letter came days after a federal court backed the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) definition that cryptocurrencies are, in fact, commodities. Yang's campaign has run on a pro-technology ticket and he is the only candidate so far to have an official policy on cryptocurrency. He has repeatedly advocated for a clear U.S. policy on cryptocurrencies and, if elected, said he would introduce ""clear guidelines in the digital asset world so that businesses and individuals can invest and innovate in the area without fear of a regulatory shift.""During his Bloomberg interview, Yang, named to CoinDesk's Most Influential list in 2019, said people will continue to use cryptocurrencies regardless of whether they are regulated or not. Attempts at a ban would simply force cryptos underground. ""You couldn't impede it with regulation if you tried,"" he said. What the U.S. needs is ""clear and transparent rules so that everyone knows where they can head in the future and we can maintain competitiveness,"" according to Yang. Back in November, the creator of the New York BitLicense, Benjamin Lawsky, said the U.S. had lost its lead in the technology, allowing other countries to move ahead. He recommended U.S. regulators look to Singapore and how it has begun regulating cryptocurrencies, calling it effective regulation that enables promising startups to grow.

TaxBit CEO Austin Woodward said so far “thousands” of users have signed up for the 2020 tax season, including a few exchanges. Dragonfly Capital co-founder Alex Pack said connecting automated software to an exchange account could create additional privacy risks in the case of a cloud breach, which is why the firm invested in TaxBit’s experienced team. “There are a lot of attacks on blockchain around anonymity or pseudonymity that rely on knowing a lot of the addresses between various exchanges,” Pack said. “That’s why we would only trust something like TaxBit … which comes from the business-to-business, security-focused mindset.” He added the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is being “heavy-handed” when it comes to staking and DeFi products. Because there are no clear categories for the experimental assets, prudent DeFi users record everything from wallet addresses to open source code links in case the IRS comes knocking. That’s why these new compliance tools record and aggregate data across various networks. “Our software offers real-time monitoring, because we have the API connections. We’re pulling in data as you trade, at least daily,” TaxBit’s Woodward said. “We’re releasing a lot of functionality around tax optimization. Recommending trades that could give users the most beneficial tax answer.”So far, Woodward said DeFi users that used MakerDAO loans and other financial products beyond exchanges need to enter transaction details manually, relying on support from TaxBit’s chat hotline with tax attorneys and CPAs (Certified Public Accountants). Both of the above-mentioned startups are working with clients to improve their systems’ ability to automatically flag potentially taxable events in the DeFi ecosystem.As for Cryptio, which is strictly focused on serving businesses and doesn’t offer a TurboTax-style option for retail users like TaxBit, Scalia said his team is helping clients that used DeFi products to record information related to every smart contract the asset touched along the way. “The exchange of the ETH that I’m depositing on the Compound smart contract for the c-ETH in my wallet could be seen as a trade. This [compliance standard] is unknown,” Scalia said, referring to the lending platform Compound, which uses synthetic crypto assets. “You have to be able to say, ‘Here is all the smart contract activity and transactions that led to the creation of this synthetic asset.’”CoinDesk reached out to the team at MakerDAO, DeFi’s most popular loan platform, about the accounting challenges presented by leaderless services and will update the article if we hear back. In part because the accounting requirements are so unclear, a Credit Karma survey found just 0.04 percent of Americans reported their crypto transactions in their 2018 taxes, compared to an estimated 4 percent of the population saying they used crypto. This is expected to change since the IRS issued a crypto-oriented guidance update in 2019. Pack, Scalia and Woodward all agreed tax reporting is a major barrier to crypto adoption. People don’t know how to use the technology without the headache of so much paperwork. As such, these startups see their role as enabling the next wave of mainstream, compliant usage. “My thesis is that within the next few tax seasons, the number of [people reporting crypto on their taxes] will be 100 times larger,” Dragonfly’s Pack said. “That hasn’t even been factored in yet. … I think figuring out how to [definitively] do accounting for DeFi is still several years out.”The leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies.
