","After bitcoin (BTC) forcefully broke through the USD 10,000 mark on Sunday, followed by a flash-crash down to USD 9,700 on Monday morning, analysts now predict that even larger gains may lie ahead for the number one digital asset.","While the short-lived sell-off seen in the early hours of trading on Monday may have scared off some short-term speculators, the consensus in the community appears to be that this is normal profit-taking, potentially combined with a so-called “gap fill” on the CME futures market.$BTC UpdateAt pixel time (08:39 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 9,943 and is down by 2% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 6%. The price is up by 24% in a month.BTC price chart:A gap in trading refers to the gap between the closing price one day and the opening price on the next trading day. In the case of the CME, trading is closed during weekends, and the futures market, therefore, has to catch up with that has happened in the spot market over the weekend. With large weekend moves in the underlying market, a gap up will be visible on the futures chart, and traders tend to “fill” these gaps by selling futures contracts.Looking at the longer-term picture, however, Willy Woo, a popular bitcoin analyst, said the breakout we have witnessed in bitcoin is “the real deal,” given that “fundamental investment activity is backing” it. Lower chart tracks investor velocity (the buy and hold people, not short term traders). This metric corrects for de… https://t.co/VjKNUNqSapSharing this bullish sentiment was also Anthony Pompliano, famous crypto personality and co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital, who shared his take on the breakout on Twitter, writing:“Bitcoin just hit USD 10,000. I still think that Bitcoin will hit USD 100,000 by end of December 2021. Fixed supply. Increasing demand. Time will tell. #Bitcoin ₿”And if that’s not enough, the recently bullish price moves are also supported by the much-discussed halving in bitcoin mining rewards, which is expected to occur in May this year. As pointed out by crypto exchange Coinbase on Twitter, halvings have historically been a precursor to large gains in the price of bitcoin.In May 2020, #Bitcoin will experience its third “Halving.” Bitcoin is a digital asset with a fixed &amp; predictable su… https://t.co/3hnKC2otvtHowever, opinions still vary whether it will happen again. In terms of the broader economy, fears for a global economic slowdown, whether caused by virus fears or geopolitical issues, may also have made bitcoin a more attractive investment among some in the traditional asset management space:“There’s certainly a narrative in the investment community that bitcoin is solidifying its place as a store of value, a flight to safety, inflation hedge,” Michael Sonnenshein, managing director of Grayscale Investments, told Bloomberg in a recent interview.Lastly, the recent move in bitcoin also appears to be supported by technical analysis, with Rob Sluymer, a chartist at Fundstrat Global Advisors writing in a note shared by Bloomberg that “bitcoin appears to be in a textbook re-acceleration.” He added that any pullback would most likely be relatively shallow, and that bitcoin would then be “resuming its longer-term uptrend into year-end.”Oh boy.

","Bitcoin (BTC) may have already entered the fourth bullish price cycle in its history, with each cycle longer than the previous one. If true, only moderate price gains should be expected in the near-term, as the strongest gains are typically seen towards the end of the cycle, a new report from crypto analytics firm Coin Metrics suggested.","According to them,  the previous cycles indicate a pattern of lengthening where each cycle takes longer to complete than the previous cycle — an expected result if cycles are driven by a new wave of adoption and awareness from a certain group of users, each bigger than the last.“Bitcoin’s price correction following the summer of last year has put the current cycle in line with the previous cycle that started in early 2015. If historical price cycles are reliable guide, we should expect further periods of only moderate price growth interspersed with brief periods of rapid growth and corrections,” the analysts said.Further, the report also pointed to a statistic known as bitcoin’s “estimated cost basis distribution,” which reveals that a large majority of bitcoins in circulation are now owned by investors who have unrealized gains on a U.S. dollar-basis. The statistic, which was calculated using a bitcoin price of USD 8,687, said that 72% of bitcoins now had unrealized gains, up from only 50% a month ago.“The current distribution shows that the vast majority of bitcoin has an estimated cost basis less than USD 12,000 and that at these levels, only a small increase in price is needed to dramatically improve investor sentiment,” the report said.The bitcoin price cycles referred to by Coin Metrics has gained popularity in the community, with other analysts, including the legendary technical analyst Peter Brandt, also sharing similar charts, showing bitcoin may have entered its fourth parabolic phase.At pixel time (12:42 PM UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 8,679 and is almost unchanged in a day. The price is up 1% in a week and 15% in a month. In the past 12 months the most popular cryptocurrency ralied 144%.

","If the Cryptoverse is lucky, a new app could see billions of American rewards points converted into cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin (BTC).","“The legacy payments infrastructure is ripe for disintermediation,” Jeff Sprecher, founder and CEO of Bakkt operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) told Fortune. “The Internet should make it possible to create a direct payment system that doesn’t use a third-party set of rails. It hit us that making rewards cash-like would be a step in that direction.”As reported this week, ICE agreed to acquire Bridge2 Solutions, a provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. When Bridge2 Solutions ultimately joins Bakkt, the strategic combination will accelerate the development of the Bakkt consumer application, which will provide digital asset aggregation, conversion, and payments through a single platform for consumers around the world, the company said. Now, ICE revealed more details. Bridge2 operates a range of the country’s biggest loyalty redemption sites, which “hold a combined total of USD 60 billion ready-to-go rewards,” Fortune reported.And ICE plans to develop an app with Bridge2 that would do away with credit card providers and banks, in favor of sponsor-issued digital credit cards that carry a merchant’s brand.The companies say they are “testing a pilot program” for the app, which will be called Loyalty Pay. The app could allow users to claim rewards in four different categories.An image provided to the media outlet by Bakkt shows a mock-up for a potential Loyalty Pay wallet, which shows a user’s funds divided into four sections, one of which is labeled “crypto.” The other three are “cash, “rewards” and “in-game” (likely currencies and tokens that can be used to buy in-game items and upgrade characters).Fortune wrote, “Folks could not only make purchases with the app using cash or bitcoin but also seamlessly transfer money from one category to another. “In a recent earnings call, Sprecher stated that “the next big hurdle for the company will be getting the app into consumer hands.”It would mean that a share of the ""USD 60 billion ready-to-go rewards,"" held by Bridge2, might be eventually converted into cryptocurrencies.The CEO also said that Bakkt would be “looking at consumer adoption more than revenue or expense” in 2020, and enthused that Bridge 2 “has a revenue stream both from trading and from the operation of all these rewards programs for 4,500 companies.”He added,“[The focus will be] not so much revenue and bottom line. It is broad adoption, I think, for 2020 that we'll be looking toward.”The CEO opined that a number of firms that run rewards programs were keen to attract younger customers – and could be keen to use crypto rewards as an incentive. He claimed that he was having “conversations across a broad range of industries” on the matter.Sprecher said that companies were now asking themselves if “more millennials can be attracted to” Bridge2 partner companies “by virtue of having cryptocurrency in their ecosystem.”"

","Bitcoin continues to make its early adopters rich but how much of a risk is making an investment today? There are all kinds of factors to consider. Will governments try to ban it? Can governments successfully ban it? Will quantum computing or another cryptocurrency render the Bitcoin technology obsolete? Of course, then there’s risks inherent with any investment. Do you look after it yourself, or trust a third party to do it for you? If you opt for the former, how is the best method to secure it? The following article addresses these concerns and aims to give those yet to get started in the world of cryptocurrency some points to consider before they buy their first Bitcoin (or fraction of one – as the case may be).For those unaware, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer, decentralised currency. It’s scare and therefore has a value attached to it. Bitcoin can be used to buy things over the internet, or in person. Many websites accept it, as do other services such as casinos. It might seem a bit alien using it for payments at first. However, it’s simple. For example, the process of making a transaction or deposit with Bitcoin is explained at NoDepositExplorer. Reasons behind Bitcoin’s growthThere’s no denying Bitcoin’s meteoric growth since it was first introduced to the world by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Starting life as an experiment in cryptography and decentralised consensus systems, certain network rules began to appeal to investors as Bitcoin began to slowly emerge from the shadows of cypher punk and libertarian circles. The chief of these is its absolute maximum supply of 21 million coins. With a fixed supply, one of the two variables determining price cannot be adjusted. For those who discovered Bitcoin early, this presented a unique proposition – digital scarcity. Like gold, ivory, and many other scare commodities on the planet, any increase in demand for Bitcoin would automatically create an increase in the price per Bitcoin. For those earliest investors, this was a very desirable attribute indeed.As time passed, and the ecosystem matured, Bitcoin’s use cases improved. Many began to see its immutability as its main value proposition. For the rules to be changed in anyway would require immense capital investment and once the necessary hardware had been obtained, thanks to the incentive structure, it would be more profitable to just mine Bitcoin and play by the network rules. Over time, Bitcoin has proved itself to be immensely resilient to both attack and alteration. This has led many around the world to see it as a permission-less store of value. There are no barriers to entry. All a person needs to use Bitcoin is access to some and an internet connection to transfer or receive coins. The lack of entry barriers provides a second important use case that gives Bitcoin value too. This is that citizens in places such as Venezuela and Zimbabwe can use cryptocurrency to “escape” from their own ravaged economies. Hyperinflation and currency devaluation has caused millions across the globe to lose practically everything they’ve worked their whole lives for. Remember those pictures in history textbooks of the men with wheelbarrows full of money in post-WWI Germany? That still happens in parts of the world today. Bitcoin can provide a safe-haven to store value in whilst the proverbial hits the fan in economies across the world. It’s reasons such as these, plus a lot of “get rich quick” speculation that has caused the mass scramble to buy Bitcoin in 2017. It sounds too good to be true, right? Well, it still might be yet...The governments of the world, even those lovely, pseudo-democratic ones that let their citizens choose between “Elitist Party Red” and “Elitist Party Blue”, command a lot of power thanks to their control of national currencies through central banking. Bitcoin represents an immense challenge to this. For the powers that be, the thought of permission-less, global banking is a scary one. How would a government profit from the printing of their own currency? Worse still, how would central banks be able to take gambles with citizens’ livelihoods capable of crashing entire economies and still pay their senior members immense bonuses? If Bitcoin achieved the kind of global adoption that some proponents desire, the answer is simply: they wouldn’t. This naturally scares governments, particularly those who are used to exerting immense control over their citizens. We’ve already seen China take steps towards regulating cryptocurrencies this year, and some nations have attempted to ban Bitcoin entirely. Such legislative steps have often had an impact of the Bitcoin price and certainly will have rattled a few investors in the process. For now, regulations that have been enforced have only hurt the price briefly. A global initiative against Bitcoin, or a terrorist atrocity that was funded by it, on the other hand, could create sufficient ill-feeling to considerably damage the investments of many. Interestingly, however, there seems to be very little that governments could do to stamp out Bitcoin in the long term. If there was, they would have probably already attempted to do so by now. The only options available are extreme to say the least. They could try to ban all CPU and GPU processors, or to switch off the internet entirely. However, draconian measures such as these would likely result in social upheaval the likes of which the earth has never seen.  Another risk that Bitcoin investors face is posed by quantum computing. There are many who believe that the immense power of the quantum machines currently under development could make brute force hacking private keys simple and effective. If this were possible, not a single wallet on the planet would be safe. Naturally, investors would attempt to sell en masse with hopes to retain whatever value they could. This would quickly result in a Bitcoin price of single digits or even zero overnight. For now, however, quantum computing does not pose a significant risk to investors. What’s more, the network of developers working solidly to improve the Bitcoin protocol have this threat on their radar and will attempt to circumvent it before it ever materialises. Another technological factor that poses a risk to investors is that Bitcoin could eventually be replaced with a better technology. There are already competitors in the space that offer slightly different functionalities. Take Monero, for example. This privacy-based crypto-coin allows for completely anonymous transactions and would likely be favoured by users for certain applications. Clamp downs on Bitcoin could cause this userbase to grow, for example. However, each of these current alt-coins, as they are known, lack something that only Bitcoin itself offers – a true grassroots evolution. You can’t recreate the way Bitcoin was launched today. There’s too much hype around the space. The fact that there is genuinely no leader, no company, and no central institution to trust is vital for its current value proposition makes it special. Developers can argue all they want about the direction they wish Bitcoin to move. Forks of Bitcoin can be created at will by network participants wishing to make changes to the protocol. However, the success of these efforts is determined by market alone. If users of cryptocurrency think the changed version is a worthy one, they will adopt it. There is no authority who can say: “This is how Bitcoin is now.” This immutability makes Bitcoin the ideal choice for those seeking a reliable store of value from cryptocurrency. To recreate such a situation today, would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible.As with anything of great value, it’s possible that investors could become the victim of theft. Broadcasting that you own Bitcoin is a terrible idea. Firstly, you make yourself a target for any potential government clampdown. Secondly, and more likely, you increase the risk of you becoming a victim of crime. Even if you own 0.1BTC and go telling everyone you know about your small investment, if John McAfee’s $500,000 Bitcoin comes true, you’ll not only be very pleased, but you’ll also be a potential target for thieves. There have already been several cases of extortion being used across the globe to steal Bitcoin and there will certainly be more to come. Criminals have also targeted exchanges where many naïve Bitcoin users choose to store their coins. These can become victim of hackings and when they do, the users are often the ones who take the hit. With little regulation covering exchanges, many could potentially disappear suddenly blaming bankruptcy following an attack. The Bitcoin network is beautiful because it’s entirely trust-less. Users need only have faith in mathematics, which is provable. The more time spent using centralised services with cryptocurrency, the greater the risk posed to investors. It’s really that simple. Most of the risks within the space we’ve outlined thus far are outside of an individual investor’s control. There’s no way for the average person, even those with immense capital behind them, to protect against the heavy hand of the government, or quantum computers. Furthermore, if a better, more democratic and usable cryptocurrency were to emerge, a quick switch from Bitcoin to the new tech would be the only way to hedge against Bitcoin’s decline. Staying up-to-date with developments in the space is crucial for serious investors.That said, users can certainly minimise some of the risks associated with Bitcoin. The easiest way to do this is to learn how to correctly store cryptocurrencies in the safest way possible. Firstly, it’s vital that any cryptocurrency is taken immediately off the exchange. If you’re planning on trading the swings regularly (a risk in itself), then it makes sense to leave your funds where they can be accessed most easily. However, if you consider yourself in it for the long haul, some form of cold storage is vital. The cheapest and most secure method is to use a paper wallet. However, many users are prepared to sacrifice that little bit of security for the increased convenience of a hardware device – much like credit and debit card users are prepared to risk the use of contactless technology in exchange for the ease with which they can make small purchases. This is fine, and the risk is minimal. For ultimate peace of mind, however, splitting an investment up is the most secure. Allocating two thirds to two individual paper wallets and one third to a hardware solution – all stored in different secret locations is one of the safest ways to protect against prying eyes, or natural disaster-type occurrences that can destroy Bitcoin storage solutions."

January 25, 2020
","New investors are the lifeblood of bitcoin (BTC). New investors rushed to buy BTC in December 2017, and it's new investors that are needed if the most popular cryptocurrency is to enjoy significant gains in 2020 and beyond.","Research firm TokenInsight made this point in its annual mining industry report, writing that in ""the long run, the main factor supporting the bitcoin price is the inflow of new investors."" Also, Su Zhu, CEO of Singaporean hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, recently speaking of the optimistic stock-to-flow forecasts, stressed that adherents to this school of thought “would still need other people to come to their belief system,” even “if they put all their savings into Bitcoin.”Well, according to TokenInsight analysts themselves as well as other experts, new investors will gravitate to bitcoin this year. For the most part they’re likely to be institutional investors, but more retail investors are also likely to come to bitcoin in the following years, as the price begins to climb.Bitcoin had a mixed, somewhat underwhelming 2019. Beginning at around USD 3,500, its price climbed briefly to a peak of USD 13,000 in July before beginning a staggering decline below USD 7,000, although it has since risen to almost USD 9,000 since the beginning of the year (and now is back closer to USD 8,000).This is hardly where many of the most famous 'analysts' had predicted Bitcoin would be by the end of 2019. Oliver Isaacs predicted USD 25,000 by the end of last year (or early this year), while in mid-2018 Fundstraat predicted that BTC could hit USD 36,000 or even 64,000.As the aforementioned TokenInsight report implies, one of the key reasons why last year didn't end in an investment bang for bitcoin was that not enough new investors entered its market. And as analyst Gary McFarlane explains to Cryptonews.com, the volatility of a market driven mostly by retail investors demands the calming influence of institutional players.""Crypto markets are immature,"" he says. ""Generally speaking, the higher the proportion of retail investors the higher the volatility. This is premised on the fact that private investors will tend to have less market knowledge, experience and be more likely to make panicky decisions. So the mix of investors needs to change – which means more institutional buyers.""On top of this, the law of supply and demand dictates that increasing demand is needed to drive the bitcoin price higher. This is what TokenInsight senior analyst Johnson Xu tells Cryptonews.com.""To support BTC price in the long run, there must be an inflow of new investors to grow the industry, both in terms of the price and the fundamental value,"" he explains. ""To grow the industry in general, the cryptocurrency industry needs to attract a significant number of people to the industry to properly build, advance and reflect the industry value, and drive BTC price to a higher level.""
Admittedly, 2019 did bring some increased institutional investment in bitcoin. Bakkt, for example, launched its institutional crypto custody service.After a bleak start, Bakkt did begin to gain traction as the year drew to a close, and it's in this context that various experts are expecting 2020 to bring a much-desired wave of new investment into bitcoin.Johnson Xu predicts, ""We will see new investors coming to the market in 2020, but a larger proportion of investors are expected to come from institutional or accredited traditional investors who want to gain exposure to the bitcoin market as part of the diversified portfolio, at least initially.""Other experts also anticipate that, while new bitcoin investment will arrive in 2020, it may not be as fast or dramatic as some might hope. CryptoOracle’s Lou Kerner is one of these, and he tells Cryptonews.com he's expecting more of a gradual increase in investors this year.""I anticipate new investors to fall along a standard ""S"" curve of adoption,"" he says. ""The question is when does the slope of the curve start going vertical? It could be 2020, but it could also be further in the future.""Analyst Joe Saz is another voice advising caution. He expects that the growth rate of new investment will all depend on whether bitcoin can reach new highs first.""If we have new investors that number of investors will be relatively small,"" he explains to Cryptonews.com. ""The halving in May will definitely drive price from pockets within the community, but that event doesn't mean much outside of our relatively small market.""
However, as Saz adds, things might be different if BTC hits a new all-time high. ""Then we might get a 2017 FOMO [fear of missing out] level investor situation again.""In the years beyond 2020, what may be a modest rate of growth will gain momentum as more investors add critical mass to the BTC market.""The inflow of new investors will continue to pick up the pace in the foreseeable future as the cryptocurrency market is still maturing and rapidly gaining traction, also, it's still relatively small in size compared to the traditional financial market,"" says Johnson Xu.And while this year may be more about an increase in institutional investment, Xu adds that subsequent years will likely witness an uptick in retail investment.""A new wave of the general retail investors will arrive in a later stage when we see a significant increase in the price of bitcoin which leads to wider news coverage, consequently turning into higher interest from the retail money.""

","After forming a short term top below the USD 9,650 resistance, bitcoin price started a downside correction. BTC/USD broke the USD 9,350 and USD 9,250 support levels. It even spiked below USD 9,200 and currently (09:00 UTC) consolidating above USD 9,200.
On the other hand, there was a decent increase in most major altcoins, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin, bitcoin cash, BNB, EOS, TRX, ADA, and XLM. XRP/USD outperformed and rallied more than 10% to surpass the USD 0.265 and USD 0.272 resistance levels. ETH/USD is also climbing and it is back above USD 190.","Total market capitalization In the past three sessions, bitcoin price  followed a short term bearish path below the USD 9,350 support level. BTC/USD even traded below the USD 9,200 level and tagged the USD 9,080 area. It is currently consolidating above USD 9,200 and facing a lot of hurdles on the upside near the USD 9,320 and USD 9,350 levels. 
If there is a clear break above USD 9,350, the price might continue to rise towards the USD 9,550 resistance level. On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 9,080 level, below which it could slide towards USD 8,850.Ethereum price  remained well bid above the USD 185 support and it recently recovered higher. ETH/USD surpassed the USD 190 level, but it is struggling to continue above the USD 192 level. The next key hurdles are USD 195 and USD 200.
On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 188 level, followed by USD 185. A clear break below the USD 185 support might call for an extended decline towards the USD 178 support.Bitcoin cash price  is rising within a tiny range above the USD 375 and USD 370 support levels. On the upside, a clear break above the USD 390 and USD 395 is needed for a sharp increase above the USD 400 level. The next stop could be USD 440.
Litecoin  remained well bid above the USD 65.50 and USD 66.00 levels. LTC/USD is rising again and it is approaching the USD 70.00 resistance area. A clear break above the USD 70.00 level might start a strong increase towards the USD 72.50 and USD 74.00 levels. On the downside, the main uptrend support is at USD 65.50.
XRP price  surged higher recently and surpassed many hurdles near USD 0.265 and USD 0.272. The price even climbed above the USD 0.280 level. It seems like the bulls are aiming a test the USD 0.298 and USD 0.300 resistance levels in the coming sessions.In the past three sessions, many small-capitalization altcoins climbed more than 5%, including MANA, KICK, LSK, HBAR, GNT, STEEM, SC, ZEN, IOST, ONT, VSYS, NEO, ZIL, XLM, ELF, BTT, HOT, and DOGE. Out of these, MANA is up around 16% and KICK gained nearly 14%.
Overall, bitcoin is still holding the USD 9,000 region. However, the bulls need to push BTC/USD back above the USD 9,350 level to start a fresh increase. If not, there is a risk of a larger downside correction below the USD 9,000 level."

Morgan Creek Digital co-founder Anthony Pompliano, who debated Schiff before, replied to that ""Now do the last 5 years,"" referring to the massive 2,603% difference from BTC's price in January 2015.Crypto researcher and analyst Willy Woo commented on what he called ""the largest miner capitulation LTC has ever faced,"" saying that the Litecoin Difficulty Ribbon was in recovery, which should set up a bullish breakout of the bearish channel.

Among the answers people gave is that altcoins are treated as high beta and that the situation needs to be looked at from the one-year, not one-day perspective.Another popular crypto analyst and trader, Josh Rager, commented on the market as well, saying ""BTC at resistance.

",An outspoken Bitcoin critic who recently rage-quit crypto has been forced into an embarrassing u-turn – after mixing up his wallet PIN with his password.,"Peter Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital and one of the most prominent public advocates of gold as a commodity, has been openly critical of cryptocurrencies in the past. Despite his vocal disdain for crypto, however, he has admitted to holding bitcoin, gifted by some members of the Cryptoverse.But his latest tirade against digital tokens has ended in a sudden climbdown.Schiff had claimed on January 20 that his wallet account at service provider Blockchain.com had been “corrupted,” meaning he had “lost” all of his funds.As previously reported, Schiff stated that he had known all along that Bitcoin was “intrinsically worthless,” adding,“I knew that owning Bitcoin was a bad idea, I just never realized it was this bad!”However, three days later, Schiff has returned to Twitter to post that he had made the “honest but costly mistake” of mixing up his PIN with his password.My #Bitcoin mystery is solved.

","As every year, be prepared that something unforeseen could happen in 2020 also, fueling another bitcoin (BTC) rally, Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer of major crypto payment processor BitPay, reminded. In either case, he estimates that BTC will rise above USD 20,000 this year.","“A lot of people think it’s going to be because of the halving […], but I think that’s already factored in a lot. Bitcoin, again, goes up high when unforeseen things happen. Last year, the catalyst behind that was Libra happening with Facebook,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. According to Singh, China, Russia, India could legalize Bitcoin, or some new, Facebook-level companies will enter the crypto industry, or the American government could do something unforeseen that could push bitcoin price “fast and far.”Going into further detail on these “unforeseen incidents,” Singh also used the Iranian situation as an example, saying that the incident did fuel a market rally.“Any time you have an unforeseen circumstance, like the Iran incident that happened a couple of days ago, that adds some new buyers to the market […] and that really drives [the market] to be up 20% in two days,” Singh said.In the interview, Singh further argued that the narrative of bitcoin as a safe haven is nothing new. It first happened during the “Greece incident” several years ago, he said, referring to the capital controls imposed by the Greek government in 2015 to prevent a banking collapse in the country. However, he also pointed out that events like these is something that happens “every couple of years,” and that we will, therefore, see something similar again.“I don’t think a lot of people went and sold their GE stocks and went and bought bitcoin, but what we see happen is that just a little bit of people start to buy bitcoin, […] and that really bumps it up and makes it go a lot higher, a lot faster,” Singh explained."

","Jason Guthrie is the Head of Capital Markets in Europe at the international investment giant WisdomTree.
","The current economic climate is a concern for investors. Trade-restructuring, high levels of liquidity, systemically-low inflation, inverted yield curves, negative-yielding bonds, historically tight employment markets, and significant leverage at both consumer and government levels are just some of the factors that suggest we are in a world where monetary and fiscal policies could tenably be argued by those at opposite ends of the spectrum, and as a result, many people are questioning the effectiveness of modern-day monetary systems.At the same time, there is a clear lack of trust in central banks. Consider the U.S. Federal Reserve, for example. While the Federal Reserve is meant to be an independent central bank, it has its governors appointed by the President of the United States, and it also frequently engages with the Treasury, meaning that, in all practicality, it works with the government. This raises questions over conflicts of interest and market manipulation. There is no fail-safe mechanism to prevent the Treasury from creating cheap financing for the U.S. government by issuing more debt while the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. Meanwhile, in other G20 countries, central banks have become buyers of all kinds of debt, severely inflating their balance sheets without true accountability.Given this backdrop, it is unsurprising that Bitcoin and Blockchain – the digital ledger technology on which all transactions are recorded - has gained credence over the last decade. It is the lack of trust in the current financial system, and the subsequent demand for a more robust monetary system that is boosting the appeal of the cryptocurrency. Given that Bitcoin’s inherent structure is designed to address the shortcomings of traditional currency management, many see it as a genuine alternative to ‘money’ as we know it. Here, we look at why now could be a good time for investors to consider exposure to Bitcoin within their portfolios.Bitcoin solves many of the problems associated with today’s monetary systems. For a start, it is not a sovereign institution-designed financial instrument that could serve any ulterior motive; it has been created as an alternative to traditional payment networks, by the public, and it is a declaration of the democratic determination of value as its very existence undergoes a continuous vote-of-confidence. Moreover, there is full visibility – the blockchain attribute allows for immutable accounting and ensures that no provisions of the manifesto are violated.Additionally, with Bitcoin, we do not need to be concerned about oversupply, as supply of the asset is capped. And supply up until a terminal point is self-regulating; if network economics prohibit the creation of new units at the same pace, then the supply schedule naturally slows.Comparing Bitcoin to fiat currencies like Sterling or U.S. Dollars and gold, the cryptocurrency ranks well in terms of its ability to be exchanged and stored, while retaining its independent qualities. In a post-Bretton Woods world, where central bank policy has been marred by suspicion, a trust-less solution is making its own case. So, why is it important to consider Bitcoin as an investment now?To answer this question, consider Bitcoin’s core traits:Apply the filter of the current global economic backdrop and it becomes clear that Bitcoin fully deserves a spot in the global macro toolkit. Yet with only 21 million Bitcoins ever created – a third of which are believed to be permanently lost – and a scaling back of production planned for the near future, it is not inconceivable that we will see a supply shock issue in the near term, just as institutions are gearing up their interest. As such, we believe that any forward-thinking investor should become familiar with Bitcoin, assess the potential and risks associated with this young but promising asset class, and consider an allocation to the asset, however small, within their portfolios.The uncertainty and excesses within the global financial system today, paired with a demand for financial prudence and egalitarianism, mean that there are numerous tailwinds that will serve to channel capital, at least at the margin, away from traditional investment options to the benefit of Bitcoin. For this reason, now may be the time for opportunistic investors to seize the Bitcoin opportunity."

","The bitcoin (BTC) safe haven narrative perhaps got its strongest confirmation in the wake of the U.S. missile strike in Iran, and it showed growth as a legitimate asset class, finds crypto market analysis firm Coin Metrics.","The BTC as a safe haven narrative is a tale as old as bitcoin, and numerous discussion have been led in the past decade over the properties of this asset that would allow it to serve as a safe haven, as well as over the possible influence of the geopolitical and macroeconomic events, particularly those causing a sense of uncertainty. ""We have witnessed perhaps the strongest validation of the bitcoin safe haven theory in its 11-year history,"" writes Coin Metrics in their latest report, ""and this watershed moment marks an important milestone in bitcoin’s maturation as a legitimate asset class."" The recent events the world witnessed between the United States and Iran have provided much-needed empirical evidence in the discussion of BTC's reaction to geopolitical circumstances so that the theory could move past anecdotal evidence. Coin Metrics looked into three major events connected to the military tension between the U.S. and Iran.1. January 3: U.S. drone strike in Iran kills Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani, with the news of it containing few details coming out three hours later.By this point, oil and gold already reacted positively, while BTC had a c. three-hour delay. Hence, the response can't be used as evidence of its safe haven properties, because other explanations are possible:2. January 7: Iran launches a missile attack against United States military bases in Iraq; military tensions escalate.An examination of the Iranian response illustrates how rapidly market efficiency can improve, says Coin Metrics. Explanations for BTC's response are fewer this time around, with the evidence suggesting a connection between BTC and the escalation of military tensions and serving as a validation of the safe haven theory:3. January 8:  Comments by the U.S. President Donald Trump are interpreted as a cessation of hostilities and a deescalation of tensions. This provides ""perhaps the strongest evidence in the history of bitcoin"" of a direct connection between bitcoin and geopolitical events. ""While the previous two events in our study measured bitcoin’s response on the order of hours, its response to this event can be measured on the order of minutes,"" the report concludes.  Meanwhile, as reported, in November we saw developments in global traditional markets and BTC moves complicating the narrative that BTC price benefits from safe haven capital flows. After the January U.S. assassination of the Iranian general, we saw the safe haven theory being tested, and a few days later, bitcoin’s safe haven status was ‘beta tested’ yet again.At pixel time (13:44 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 8.774 and is up 2.7% in a day and almost 5% in a week."

January 24, 2020
","World's most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is one step closer to seeing it's largest change since 2017.","Developer and Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille, has submitted a ""pull request,"" which lets others know that a code change is ready for reviews, discussions, suggestions, etc. by the community, in order to add more commits if needed, and get the changes ready to be merged into the base branch upon a decision to do so. The pull request concerns a significant code change that is designed to increase privacy of the coin, called Taproot. ""What is taproot? Trying to make all output scripts and most spends indistinguishable,"" said Wuille. As previously reported, Taproot soft fork comes together with more upgrades, complementary to each other. There are three BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) encompassed by this proposal, and have been officially named BIPs 340, 341, and 342. The Schnorr/Taproot proposal is now published as BIPs 340, 341, and 342; see https://t.co/33uiulO8RANote that the assignment of BIP numbers is not any kind of stamp of approval; it just means the process was followed (which includes some amount of public discussion).The upgrade includes a soft fork called Schnorr, which not only helps protect privacy, but it increases scalability and speed. Combined with Taproot, Schnorr would allow signature data to be mashed together, thus encoding multiple keys into a single one. What happens is that Taproot utilizes Schnor and adds smart contract capabilities to BTC, therefore ensuring better privacy. If the soft fork happens and the combination of these two is introduced, Bitcoin usersâ€™ advanced payments would be hidden and complex payments would seem like any other normal transaction. It would generally be more difficult for outsiders to figure out what's happening within a transaction and what any particular user is doing.""Merging this is obviously conditional on getting community support for the proposal. It's opened here to demonstrate the code changes that it would imply,"" writes Wuille. This is a major step on the long path of an upgrade to become official and could potentially be the biggest one after the addition of Segregated Witness (SegWit) first activated in 2017 on the Litecoin and then on the Bitcoin networks. Bitcoin's activation of SegWit increased network transaction speeds and decreased transaction fees, while the Lightning Network continues its developments, making transactions faster.So far it seems that Taproot will not cause as many disagreements within the community as SegWit did. The response has already been largely positive, while a number of developers have reviewed the proposal and made comments on it. Bitcoin Core contributor Anthony Towns announced in November 2019 that a group of more than 160 participants will be reviewing Taproot with the goal for each to either find major issues that need be fixed, or OK the formalization of the drafts and move towards implementation/deployment phases. Those who have provided feedback have ""ACKed"" the proposal, meaning ""go ahead and move to the next stage.""However, it's not clear when Tapproot might be implemented.Taproot BIP review begins next week with 160+ participants!

January 14, 2020
","As Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty and hashrate are reaching new all-time highs, the Cryptoverse is discussing the meaning behind it, and it seems unlikely that the miners are capitulating ahead of the Bitcoin mining reward halving in May.","As reported by Cryptonews.com in October 2019, miners will try to increase their mining activity, so as to obtain a greater share of the hashrate ahead of the halving. And it seems that Bitcoin miners are expanding according to this scenario. Bitcoin mining difficulty, which is a measure of how hard it is to compete for mining rewards, is expected to hit yet another record in a matter of hours. The network difficulty currently stands at 14.99T, which is already the highest it's ever been. Major Bitcoin mining pool BTC.com estimates  that during the next difficulty adjustment, expected to happen later today, it will increase by 8.64%, reaching another all-time high with 15T, and making validating new blocks even harder.The last difficulty adjustment two weeks ago brought a change of over 6.5%, which is not an uncommon number to see. As a matter of fact, the difficulty dropped only seven times in 2019, usually by a small percentage, except in November when it dropped 7.10%. The difficulty, therefore, usually rises, and we've seen it go up by as high as 14%.  BTC price also dropped this past November at the time difficulty did. Furthermore, compared to the time of crypto winter and BTC dropping to the USD 3,000 level in December 2018, the difficulty we are likely to see after the next adjustment will be three times higher than that.Meanwhile, hashrate, or the computational power of the Bitcoin network, has also been rising. As a reminder, this is relevant as higher hashrate suggests more secure network, with more miners competing for the block reward, commonly leading to higher mining difficulty. It has also hit an all-time high, and the average hashrate currently is 98.67 EH/s. For comparison, at the beginning of 2019 it was 42.10 EH/s, while in December 2018, it went as low as 36.55 EH/s. It has been consistently increasing throughout the last year, and it corresponds with the rise in BTC price. In January 2019, the price was c. USD 3,500, while we've seen it go over USD 10,000 several times this year, approaching USD 14,000. At pixel time (9:20 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 8,522. It went up almost 5% in the past 24 hours, 8% in the past week, 19% in a month, and 138% in a year.Bitcoin mining difficulty (the red line) and bitcoin price chart (30 day average):There has been a lot of talks about miners potentially closing shop with the halving approaching, the difficulty increasing, the block reward declining, and the cost for generating blocks rising. The market speculated in late November that miners could capitulate, but we haven't seen a sign of that yet, and the numbers do not seem to indicate it happening (yet).""For the most profitable miners, I could certainly see them taking their excess profit and holding bitcoin if they expected the price to continue rising,"" Medio Demarco, the Principal at Delphi Digital, a cryptocurrency research company, previously told Cryptonew.com. ""Less profitable miners will probably be forced to either upgrade their operations to be more competitive or walk away (this is always the case though).""The halving anticipation itself could perhaps influence these recent increases, as well as the rise in price of the world's most popular coin, however, there are numerous ongoing debates about whether the halving is already priced in, or if the rising price could be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That said, the Cryptoverse seems to be excited for this approaching difficulty adjustment, with popular anonymous investor and Twitter user PlanB, calling it ""epic.""Tuesday's difficulty adjustment will be epic! pic.twitter.com/NZQ0xBppDdPeople were also discussing the effect of new mining equipment coming in, which is generally speaking better suited for the job and may handle the rise in difficulty better.

Other discussions: I'd say yes, the Bitcoin bottom is in.__No, you cant draw this conclusion. However,  share of newly mined coins compared to trading volumes is very low. Therefore basically shortterm not relevant. Long term..  please see S2F model.__More difficulty â€”-> less profit â€”-> more selling pressure â€”-> 2 possible outcomes: 1. Miners capitulate, sell at loss and price drops; 2. Miners sell at higher prices to cover higher breakeven and price rises.

In addition, Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, wrote in his newsletter that the break of the 200-day moving average roughly coincided with the break-out from a downward-facing trading channel that has lasted for months in the chart. “Both of these barriers have now been completely pulverized,” the analyst noted.Further, Greenspan also responded to those who question whether the break-out can hold this time, writing:“Several have already pointed out to me that we've recently seen several false breakouts and so it's possible that this will be reversed too. However, I would argue that it's a lot less likely this time. Simply for the fact that unlike the late-October Xi-boom, for example, this move has happened more gradually, allowing the market to really give a proper timely test of the relevant price levels.”He added:“I've seen it happen several times in my career, where a large move was widely anticipated by the market but is really taking its time. Then, when the technical breakout finally occurs there's a moment, or a day, or even a few days of shock and disbelief to see it's really happening.” At pixel time (10:48 UTC), BTC trades at c.

Bitcoin has busted through the USD 9,000 barrier and is now holding firmly above the USD 8,500 level.The timing fits neatly with what our cycle model tells us for this crypto bull market. And it’s still got far to go before the cycle ends.The big remaining question is: HOW far?Cycles don’t give you the most accurate answers to that question – they’re much better at telling you WHEN a market is ripe for the next move. So today we present a totally different kind of analysis. We start by asking this simple question:An impossible question to answer? Quite to the contrary, it’s actually pretty easy. Consider this hypothetical scenario…So, that means…And it’s this gain or loss that helps tell us how big the next big move in Bitcoin is likely to be.Each chart below shows the two measures we just told you about.The red line is Bitcoin’s Market Cap — how much all the Bitcoins are worth.The pink area is Bitcoin’s Realized Market Cap — how much Bitcoin owners paid for them.And what we want you to pay close attention to is the difference between the two — the overall net open gain or loss.Here’s the key…Now, let’s move through time, step by step …1. We start in July of 2013. It’s just before a major bull market really gets under way. The Realized Market Cap (pink area is just a hair below the Market Cap (red line). Bitcoin is undervalued.2. November 2013. Bitcoin takes off like a rocket, and by the end of the month, its Market Cap is far above its Realized Market Cap. That means Bitcoin owners now sit on monster unrealized gains and Bitcoin is overvalued.Result: As December begins, Bitcoin owners rush to cash in. In less than three weeks, the price of Bitcoin is literally crushed — by more than half.3. January 2015 and beyond. After a drawn out, one-year-plus bear market, a fundamental change creeps into the market: The Realized Market Cap is now significantly higher than the Market Cap. In other words, for the first time in many years, Bitcoin owners sit on big open losses.Bitcoin is grossly undervalued. And a major bull market gets under way.1. Again, we start in July, but this time in 2017. That’s exactly four years after our starting point in the prior cycle. A coincidence? No. In fact, four years is the same exact time frame of each Bitcoin halving cycle.Again, precisely as in 2013, it’s just before a major bull market gets under way.Again, the Realized Market Cap (pink area) is just a hair lower than the Market Cap (red line).And again, Bitcoin is undervalued.2. November – December 2017. Just as it did four years earlier, Bitcoin rockets higher in November. In six weeks, its Market Cap is far above its Realized Market Cap. Bitcoin is overvalued.Result: Within days it plunges, as Bitcoin owners rush to cash in. In just seven weeks, Bitcoin’s market cap is crushed again — this time by more than 60%.3. November 2018 and beyond. After a drawn out, one-year-plus bear market, that same fundamental change of four years ago returns to haunt the Bitcoin owners.In other words, for the first time in four years, Bitcoin owners sit on big open losses, and Bitcoin is grossly undervalued.4. July 2019. Nearly in perfect cyclical harmony with the four-year-earlier cycle, a new Bitcoin bull market is under way.This brings us to the present, with the next Bitcoin halving approaching and another surge in Bitcoin under way even as we speak.What is the Realized Capital Gain indicator telling us now?Well, to make it clear as day, let’s translate the Realized Market Cap it into average price that current Bitcoin owners paid for their BTC — USD 5,600!With Bitcoin now trading between USD 8,000 and USD 9,000, that means they’re sitting on open gains.But those open gains are still small. And if history is any guide, you won’t see another major decline until the Market Cap is about four times higher than the Realized Market Cap.We can’t predict what the Realized Market Cap will be at that time. But even it stays the same as it is today, we’d be looking at about USD 21,000 BTC at that time.And if Realized Market Cap itself rises, as it invariably does in a major bull market, the price of BTC would have to be far higher.

","“Bitcoin is stale.” Early champions such as Jon McAffee have been describing the original cryptocurrency as the ""true Shitcoin,"" while to make matters worse, it also recently witnessed the creation of another 'stale' block.","But why is a stale block a problem? Well, for those who don't know, a block is 'stale' when it's accepted onto the Bitcoin blockchain, but then cast off soon after, because the nodes that had added it to their versions of the chain ended up forking away to a longer, majority chain that doesn't include it.For some, the fact that a 'stale' block can be cast off proves that Bitcoin isn't actually immutable. And given that the recent stale block detected by BitMex resulted in a double spend worth USD 3, critics also claim it proves that Bitcoin isn't a viable digital monetary system.However, Bitcoin developers argue that Bitcoin is immutable, insofar as 'immutability' was ever really achievable in the first place. They also point out that double spends are practically impossible on Bitcoin, since most exchanges and payment processors tend to wait for multiple confirmations on the blockchain before confirming a transaction request.On January 27, BitMex Research tweeted that it had detected a stale block on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin had a stale block today, at height 614,732.* Size: 0.97 MB, Time: 05:37:37UTC, Miner: https://t.co/yVUGGpvX6f* Stale block - Size: 0.98 MB, Time: 05:37:56UTC, Miner Poolinhttps://t.co/uzJXPMgOmmThis is the first stale block we have found since 16 Oct 2019 pic.twitter.com/zmSg9gsL5TAs developer Eric Wall explains, this means that two nodes on the chain (perhaps located at opposite corners of the globe) solved the computation for the next valid block at the same time.""Every Bitcoin node has its own local copy of the blockchain. So does every miner,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""When two blocks are found by two different miners at the same time, they're sent across the planet. For a brief moment, ten minutes or so, there can be disagreement in the network about which block was actually found first.""Wall adds that some nodes in the network will favor one of the competing blocks, while other nodes will favor the other. ""This situation usually resolves itself with the next block that's found, which means that the nodes that accepted a block that didn't end up getting continued on by the next winning miner will have to throw their last block out. This block is thus 'stale'.""As for why some nodes might decide to 'orphan' a block, Bitcoin developer Ben Woosley explains that it's because nodes tend to favor the 'majority' chain that's the product of the most computational work.""It's essentially discarded in favor of the chain that continues to have more blocks mined onto it (the 'most work' chain),"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""In Bitcoin, the valid chain is always the 'most work' chain, and as each block is mined, it effectively 'buries' the prior blocks under its work.""So far, so ordinary. However, some observers used the creation – and discarding – of a stale block to claim that Bitcoin isn't really immutable. John Adler – a self-professed ""Blockchain skeptic"" and a co-founder of the Ethereum-based Fuel Labs – was one of these, essentially arguing on Twitter that immutability has to be absolute, otherwise it's not immutability.However, Bitcoin developers argue that this is a naive view of immutability. Such immutability has never existed and never will exist, and not only for Bitcoin but for other cryptocurrencies.""Bitcoin's claim of immutability is that an increasing number of confirmations makes it exponentially harder to reverse a transaction,"" says Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop. ""At some point, this becomes so exponentially difficult as to be impossible. That point isn't when the block is buried by one block, but rather by many.""Other developers second this view of immutability. Woosley notes that 'immutability' should be understood in terms of probability, and in particular in terms of increasingly low probabilities.""Mathematically speaking, there aren't any immutability guarantees in Bitcoin, just exponentially decreasing probability of blocks being dropped out of the blockchain as new blocks are found,"" he says.Under normal network conditions (i.e. if a chain isn't being attacked), a block is extremely improbable to drop out of the chain after just a few blocks, Woosley adds. ""After a dozen blocks, the probability becomes so low that it's more likely that your head spontaneously explodes.""As developer Nicolas Dorier explains, ""Technically speaking you can't speak of finality. Practically speaking you do.""So, ""practically speaking,"" how many confirmations on the chain are sufficient to provide 'immutability' for all intents and purposes? Well, given that immutability is really about probability, there's no hard answer to this question, although there seems to be general agreement that the number is anything between two and six.""Exchanges traditionally wait 6 confirmations,"" Dorier says. ""If I were an exchange I would accept 2 confirmations (for Bitcoin).""Wall conveys a similar picture, noting that the risks of one-block confirmations are already common knowledge.
""Some exchanges require 2, 3 or 6 confirmations because 1-block confirmations are known to not be very reliable,"" he says. ""Because this blockchain behavior is not unexpected, not many services will release any irretrievable goods or services with just 1 confirmation.""As reported, for an average transaction, only one or two confirmations (in theory, it would take c. 20 minutes) are needed to be requested by the recipient so the double spend strategy wouldn’t be profitable, according to calculations by two mathematicians.Given that most exchanges wait for several confirmations before processing a transaction, it's unlikely that double spending is even an insignificant problem on the Bitcoin blockchain, let alone a serious one."

","Bitcoin price is showing a lot of positive signs above the USD 7,350 and USD 7,400 resistance levels. Once BTC/USD settles above USD 7,550 and USD 7,650, it could set the stage for an upward move towards the USD 8,000 and USD 8,200.
Besides, most major altcoins are gaining traction and rising with a bullish bias, including ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, BNB, ADA, TRX and XLM. ETH/USD is approaching the USD 140 and USD 145 resistance levels. Moreover, XRP/USD could be eyeing an upside break above the USD 0.200 resistance area.","Total market capitalization Recently, bitcoin price  surged above the key pivot level and resistance area at USD 7,350. It has opened the doors for more upsides above USD 7,400 and USD 7,500 levels. The price is now (09:00 UTC) trading near the USD 7,550 resistance, above which it could test USD 7,650.
The next major weekly resistance is seen near the USD 8,000 level, above which there is mostly an open space up to USD 8,500. On the downside, an initial support is near the USD 7,400 level. The main weekly support is seen near the USD 7,350 level.Ethereum price  followed a bullish path and climbed above the key USD 135 resistance level. It has opened the doors for more gains in ETH/USD above the USD 138 and USD 140 resistance levels. The next major weekly resistance is near the USD 145 level.
On the downside, the previous resistance near the USD 135 and USD 132 levels may perhaps act as a support. If there is a downside break below the USD 130 weekly support, the price might turn bearish.Bitcoin cash price  is performing well and it broke the key USD 225 resistance area. BCH/USD is up more than 6% and it is now trading above the USD 235 level. The next hurdles are seen near USD 242 and USD 245. If there is a downside correction, the USD 225 level might provide support.
Litecoin  is gaining bullish momentum above the USD 42.50 resistance area. LTC/USD is up around 5% and it approaching the USD 45.00 resistance level. A clear break above the USD 45.00 barrier could set the momentum for a push towards the USD 46.50 and USD 47.20 levels.
XRP price  is slowly rising above the USD 0.195 resistance level. Having said that, XRP/USD must surpass the USD 0.200 resistance level to start a strong rise. The next major resistance levels are seen near USD 0.205 and USD 0.208. On the downside, there are supports near USD 0.192 and USD 0.190.In the past three sessions, a few small capitalization altcoins gained traction and climbed more than 5%, including MAID, BEAM, MOF, BCN, KNC, DOGE, DASH, XMR, THETA, MIOTA, BSV, KCS and ONT. Out of these, MAID is up around 17% and BEAM rallied close to 15%. Overall, bitcoin price is trading in a bullish zone above the USD 7,400 level and it might continue to rise. A daily close above the USD 7,550 and USD 7,650 resistance levels may perhaps open the doors for more gains towards USD 8,000 and USD 8,200."

full-time and funded basis. “Bitcoin open source development needs more ...","
January 27, 2020
","Many, many developers have contributed to Bitcoin’s growth since its birth in 2009.","In other words, Bitcoin is the representation of a long line of programming work. Developers have had to look for bugs, write software updates, and assume the vital task of proposing how Bitcoin might evolve.This is busy and very careful work, and one question that crops up in general discussion of Bitcoin development is: who funds it? Are developers mostly voluntary, or are they supported by funding from interested third-parties?And more importantly, is the current system of developer funding actually good for Bitcoin and its development? Well, according to the developers actually working with Bitcoin, it is mostly beneficial, even if certain problems need to be addressed.According to a developer who wished to remain anonymous, only a small proportion of programmers contribute to Bitcoin Core on a full-time and funded basis.""In 2019, 150 people contributed pull requests to Bitcoin Core,"" he tells Cryptonews.com. ""Of those, roughly 20-25 do it full-time and receive funding or salary to do so. It would be good to see this number closer to 100.""As the developer points out, there are various levels of developer involvement, with some sitting at an intermediate stage between 'full-time' and 'voluntary.'""Another 20-25 do it regularly part-time and may or may not receive a varying amount of support,"" he adds. ""Most contributors do it without any form of financial support, much less in a stable form. Fewer than 50-60 people contributed pull requests frequently and regularly to Bitcoin Core in 2019.""Another important question is that of who exactly funds Bitcoin developers. As Bitcoin Core developer Jimmy Song explains to Cryptonews.com, the answer is: pretty much any company with a financial interest in ensuring Bitcoin's stability and growth.""Usually people or companies that have benefited from Bitcoin,"" he says. ""These include companies as diverse as Blockchain.com, itBit, Square and Chaincode Labs. Many developers work on Bitcoin voluntarily as they're pretty set financially, but many also receive funding through these channels. You generally have to have a reputation first before you get funded, though.""This picture of a diverse mix of funding sources seems to be confirmed by other developers. As the anonymous developer says via email, 
""From what I can see, funding is coming from companies (Blockstream, Xapo, BitMEX, Bitmain, Binance, OKEx/OkCoin, Acinq, Lightning Labs (hopefully Kraken/Coinbase/Bitstamp/Gemini/Bitfinex soon, etc.), patronage/R&D structures (Chaincode Labs, Square Crypto, MIT DCI, HardCore.Fund), and individual donors (a few large donors and a number of smaller ones).""Put simply, Bitcoin may have begun as a communal 'hobby' back in the day, but it now serves a growing number of big financial interests. As such, it's no longer an experiment in money and coding, but the primary means by which a range of companies strive to make a profit.Given that most Bitcoin developers aren't full-time, and that they don't benefit from a formal structure of funding, it needs to be asked whether the system is sufficient to ensure the continued evolution and success of Bitcoin.Jimmy Song believes it's done a good job until now, even if there's perhaps room for improvement.""Hard to say,"" he says. ""It's working pretty well right now. There's a good number of people that see it as a good place to contribute, which makes sense as it secures the Bitcoin you own. It's a hodgepodge of sources for funding, so it's hard to say that it's beneficial or not. I know for example that Bitmain stopped funding devs as they ran into financial trouble, I suspect we'll see more of that as time goes on. It's really individuals that do their best to find funding and some are successful, others are not.""(We have contacted Bitmain for comment and will update the article should they respond.)There does seem to be the sense that Bitcoin development suffers from a relative lack of funding. And without enough funding, not everything that really needs to be done actually gets done.""Bitcoin open source development needs more funding, particularly to increase experienced and deep review of proposals and pull requests,"" explains the anonymous developer.""This is under-appreciated from the outside; people tend to pay much more attention to merged changes, mailing list posts, research papers, BIPs, and Reddit and Bitcoin StackExchange answers. Review is continuously the rarest resource and bottleneck to progress.""When it comes to the future of Bitcoin development, one concern is that growing consolidation in the wider Bitcoin industry might result in the concentration of funding sources. By extension, this could result in Bitcoin being developed in a direction that prioritizes the interests of only a few players.However, there are a number of solutions to this hypothetical problem. As explained by our anonymous developer, perhaps the most promising of these is the ""10x10"" matrix.""One idea being discussed among various people would be a ""10x10"" matrix,"" he says. ""10 independent patronage structures, decentralized, each able to fund 10 people working full-time on open source, each with their own culture, priorities and operational style.""""This would bring healthy diversity in funding which needs to be as decentralized as possible while helping companies and individuals donate, who otherwise might not know who or how to optimally sponsor.""

February 02, 2020
","Juan Villaverde is an econometrician and mathematician devoted to the analysis of cryptocurrencies since 2012. He leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings.
","Looking for the next Bitcoin (BTC, Rated ""A-"")?Some people have long thought it would be Ethereum (ETH, Rated ""B+"").Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is more than just a payment system. It’s a platform for running an infinite variety of applications, called “smart contracts” or “distributed applications” (dapps).  In fact, Ethereum aspires to be a worldwide computer capable of doing anything that a single, standalone computer can do, with two key differences:  It’s everywhere, distributed all across the internet.  And nobody owns it.That was the Ethereum dream. But then began the Ethereum nightmare — a traffic jam of epic dimensions.You see, due to Ethereum’s low capacity and slow speed — plus huge demand — the door was flung wide open to a host of wannabe Ethereum killers, all aspiring to replace it and become the new smart contract queen.  And now the big news…I’m talking about Bitcoin.And I’m referring to a new generation of Bitcoin developers that have appeared on the scene.They’re hell-bent on harnessing Bitcoin's first-mover advantage to muscle in on Ethereum's smart contract turf.Their project is RSK (RBTC), and it has all the earmarks of becoming one of the toughest combatants in the smart contract war.To be clear, RSK isn’t a run-of-the-mill upgrade to the Bitcoin blockchain.It's a whole new blockchain, designed as a sidechain that’s entirely dedicated to running smart contracts.Think of a major highway strictly for moving (or storing) money. That’s Bitcoin.Then think of a parallel superhighway for doing everything else. That’s RSK.What about the miners? They’re the same as the Bitcoin miners. Plus, of course, it’s open to anyone with Internet access and a regular computer.The major difference:Now, with this revolutionary change…Let’s say you’re among the millions who own Bitcoin.Until now, all you could do is transfer it, spend it or hoard it.But with the advent of RSK, all that changes. For the first time since Bitcoin was born, you can run Distributed Applications.Or, let’s say you’re a Bitcoin developer. Without RSK, the things you could do were very narrowly confined. Now, you can use Bitcoin to build a myriad of applications.Given the sheer size and volume of the Bitcoin network, we have little doubt RSK is going to be a hit.And Decentralized Finance (DeFi) developers could be among the first to switch.Why switch?First, because RSK and Ethereum code have a lot in common. Some might say they’re virtually the same. So with RSK, anything currently running on Ethereum should run equally well on Bitcoin. It’s a relatively easy move.Second, because of the collateral. Right now, DeFi apps that run on Ethereum use ETH for collateral. If they switch to Bitcoin, they will use BTC. Given the security, stability and size of Bitcoin, that’s a big advantage.Right now, for example, a major Ethereum-project is DAI, a stablecoin with the potential to disrupt the way money works. DAI is currently backed by ETH, which most people know much less about. Imagine if it’s backed by the widely known (and owned) Bitcoin instead!And think about what Bitcoin RSK could do for a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platforms. If they switch to Bitcoin, they have the potential to gain almost instant credibility, greatly enhancing their chances for success.End result. Someday, Bitcoin could emerge from its current, limited-use cases (mostly a store of value), and become the fuel for running smart contracts in what’s bound to become a fuel-thirsty market."

","Recently, bitcoin price made another attempt to clear the USD 8,850 resistance area. However, BTC/USD failed to continue higher and started a short term downside correction. On the downside, the USD 8,550 support area might play a major role in the coming sessions. 
On other hand, there were corrective moves in most major altcoins, including ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, BNB, ADA, TRX, and XLM. ETH/USD declined below the USD 166 and USD 165 support levels. Besides, XRP/USD trimmed most gains and traded below the USD 0.232 and USD 0.230 support levels.","Total market capitalization After forming a short term top near USD 8,850, bitcoin price  started a minor decline. BTC/USD corrected below the USD 8,700 level, but the USD 8,600 zone provided support. The main support is near the USD 8,550 level, below which the price could continue to move down towards the USD 8,350 support level.
On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 8,740 level, above which the bulls could make another attempt to clear the USD 8,850 resistance level. If they succeed, the price is likely to surge above the USD 9,000 level.Ethereum price  already started a substantial downside correction from the USD 172 swing high. ETH/USD declined below the USD 166 and USD 165 support levels. It is currently (09:00 UTC) consolidating near USD 160, with key supports near the USD 158 and USD 155 levels.
To start a fresh increase, the price must surpass the USD 166 level. The main resistance is still near USD 170 and USD 172. Any further upsides could set the pace for a push towards the USD 180 level.Bitcoin cash price  started a strong decline after it failed to gain momentum above the USD 350 and USD 370 resistance levels. BCH/USD declined below the USD 340 support and tested the USD 320 support. The main support is near the USD 300 handle, where the bulls are likely to appear.
Litecoin  started a short term drop from the USD 60.00 resistance area. LTC/USD broke the USD 57.00 support and tested the USD 55.00 area. Any further losses may perhaps lead the price towards the USD 54.20 support level. On the upside, the key hurdles are near USD 58.50 and USD 60.00.
XRP price  failed to climb above the USD 0.245 zone and declined heavily. XRP/USD is down more than 7% and it broke the USD 0.232 and USD 0.230 support levels. It is currently testing the USD 0.225 support, below which it could even test the USD 0.221 support.In the past three sessions, a few small capitalization altcoins gained more than 5%, including REP, MANA, KNC, BCD, RLC, FTT, GNT, ETN and ETC. Conversely, BSV, SNX, HC, NEXO, VSYS, BTG and AE are down more than 8%. To sum up, bitcoin is facing a strong resistance near the USD 8,850 level ahead of the USD 9,000 barrier. Therefore, there could be a short term decline towards USD 8,550 or USD 8,350 before BTC/USD starts a fresh increase."

","Crypto thieves just got another proof that they're not immune from being caught, as the Japanese police have arrested two men suspected of stealing about JPY 78 million (USD 700,000) in bitcoin (BTC) from an account on CoinExchange, a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, in October 2018. ","The Tokyo police’s cybercrime unit has arrested two Japanese citizens, aged 25 and 28, on computer fraud charges, The Japan Times reports. The two men allegedly accessed the account of Vipstar, a Japanese crypto management business which says it is developing its own coin, Vipstarcoin (VIPS). The Metropolitan Police Department launched an investigation into the theft after the firm reported the crypto being stolen. The bitcoins were part of Vipstar’s own funds, and not of the firm’s customers.The stolen cryptocurrency was redirected from the company’s account to two different accounts on foreign and domestic exchanges. At that time, the 25-year-old suspect was employed by the Tokyo-based company, serving as its chief technology officer, and he shared the login details with the 28-year-old man who used them to illegally access the firm’s bitcoins. The two allegedly met on an online bulletin board several years ago, and claim they have never met in person.A part of the stolen crypto was allegedly exchanged for cash which was deposited in one of the suspects’ accounts. The man withdrew about JPY 6 million from his account and spend it on travel and pay his debts, as reported by local daily Mainichi Shimbun. “I didn't like the president's management policy at that time, so I thought I would crush the company,” Vipstar’s former chief technology officer admitted to law enforcement officers.Both suspects reportedly plead guilty to the charges.CoinExchange announced it was closing down in October 2019 due to its financial woes. The exchange’s website remained open for withdrawals until December 1, 2019.

","You can now use Bitcoin (BTC) emoji in your tweets, and there are calls for it to be added by the world standard for text and emoji.","Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey brought good news to the Cryptoverse on February 2, by tweeting the famous Bitcoin logo, signifying that the social media giant added the BTC emoji. Now, when users hashtag the world's most popular crypto, the emoji will appear. The CEO included it in his Twitter bio as well. However, Dorsey also tagged the consortium in charge of managing the character standard, Unicode, apparently suggesting that they should add the emoji as well.The most popular symbol used for Bitcoin is exactly ₿ - a capital letter B with two vertical strokes at the top and bottom, as introduced by BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto. After Unicode rejected it as a character in 2011, it was accepted in 2015, and it finally appeared in Unicode 10.0 in 2017. It's yet to be accepted as an emoji though.The community quickly joined in, testing this new option in their tweets and bios, and it seems that the large majority of them gladly support this Twitter's latest addition, as well as the suggestion for Unicode to do the same. For example, Elizabeth Stark, co-founder and CEO of Lightning Labs, a Lightning Network developer, in which Dorsey is an investor, finds that emoji help spread awareness, and with it, increase adoption. She joined Dorsey in calling for the BTC emoji to be included in Unicode.Emoji will help spread awareness and adoption, full stop. The unicode character isn't in the standard set on any mobile devices or keyboards, and it's not nearly as fun as an emoji. 😜Other people used the new emoji to promote it too, such as Justin Sun, founder of Tron, as well as Bitcoin supporter Michelle Phan, one of YouTube’s earliest creators and most famous beauty stars, who tweeted Bitcoin emoji to 900,500 followers. Additionally, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance hashtagged Bitcoin to summon this new feature, calling for people to join the effort to get it trending, with the exchange's CEO, Changpeng Zhao, doing the same.Meanwhile, we reported previously that in March the Cryptoverse rediscovered that Microsoft Excel included BTC among available currencies, while in February everybody was checking the Google keyboard on their iPhones for a Bitcoin sign.This is far from the only crypto-related news we've ever written about this BTC supporter and investor. For example, in March 2018, Dorsey said that with new technologies and innovations, Bitcoin will become an effective cryptocurrency. He became a crypto superstar in February 2019, when he admitted to holding “the native currency of the internet.”In March, Dorsey announced that he's hiring a new team in order to help the crypto ecosystem. The team got its first member in June, and a new project, bluesky, aimed at developing a ""decentralized standard for social media"" was launched in December.Meanwhile, in January 2020, payments company Square, co-founded and led by Dorsey, was granted the patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a new network that allows crypto-to-fiat transactions.BTC is currently (10:30 UTC) trading at c. USD 9,341. It's down almost 1% in the past 24 hours but is up 8% in the past week."

January 03, 2020
","It would certainly be strange to draw all money from a bank like people are taking their crypto off the exchanges today. And it would be unthinkable for the banks to support their customers taking their money out en masse. Yet, that's what we see in the Cryptoworld. What’s more, this approach seems to be either solving some problems, or bringing them up to the surface for consideration.","Happy Bitcoin Birthday! It’s January 3rd – the eleventh anniversary of the first block in the Bitcoin blockchain mined, also known as the Genesis block. It’s also the second Proof of Keys Day (PoK), meant to display that the owners control their funds, and it’s led by the famous ‘not your keys, not your coins’ adage. Since last year, people in the crypto community have been adding [Jan/3 [key emoji]] to their Twitter handles to show support for the event and the meaning behind it.And this is the point of the blockchain and Bitcoin, and it's the point of the PoK event too – to give the people privacy and control over their funds and remind the other players in the industry, exchanges and those wallets that hold users’ keys, where that control truly lies. “It’s about strengthening the ecosystem as a whole,” said the event initiator Trace Mayer. “Satoshi gave us this wonderful gift for monetary sovereignty,” and individual action by all of us is one of the things that’ll maintain it.We’ve written last year about a number of outspoken supporters of the PoK, and some of them were in fact people from crypto exchanges, such as ShapeShift and Coinbase. ShapeShift has yet again expressed their support in the Twitter handle, and Vertbase is another platform to do so. Furthermore, as people online are calling  for a greater support by the exchanges - as there certainly should be more of it - what we’re seeing is the trend growing, bringing more major players in. Whereas Changpeng Zhao of Binance was indifferent last year, claiming that the funds on the exchange are safu, saying “feel free to do whatever you wish,” this year Binance tweeted days ahead of the event their “ultimate guide” to PoK, again posting it yesterday, promoting the PoK event. That’s not all, as Hodl Hold also supported the event, and it went a step further, saying: “Starting on the 1st of January, we are removing the trading fee for ten days to support the annual Proof of Keys initiative.”While one may think that it’s just a few exchanges on the list, it’s in fact far greater as it proves that entities within the Cryptoworld do pay attention to ‘what the people want’ as their businesses depend on it - and major players tend to be trendsetters as well. Besides the exchanges, many wallets have yet again supported the event, using the chance to promote their offering, including Blokchain.com, Exodus, Coldcard, etc. It could be argued that through events such as these when individuals take control over their funds, bad players in the industry could be distinguished from the good ones, leading to their demise. Mayer said so as well during an interview, taking the failures of Cryptopia and Quadriga CX as examples. “It's great to see an exchange actively supporting proof of keys. Proof of keys is an opportunity for solvent exchanges to distinguish themselves from insolvent exchanges,” said a Twitter user ‘Daniel’.Last year's Proof Of Keys put some serious pressure on shady exchanges like Quadriga, Cryptopia NZ, & HitBTC. The first two exchanges are now kaput... which exchanges will the second #proofofkeys expose this year? Will HitBTC survive? https://t.co/U9kfU0QWTfAnother issue that this event seems to have highlighted is “that non custodial are failing to convince.” Ouriel Ohayon, CEO at ZenGo wallet, says that “convenience trumps ideology and principles” and that “we can repeat all day long ""not your keys not your coins"" most people don't care.” Some people are attracted to self-custodial setup as they’ve got no choice, but those that do “vastly prefer custodial services,” he claims.6/ I believe it is possible to build vastly superior services based on non custodial principles. But not with the same old recipes.There were future predictions on the relevance of this users’ movement as well. For example, Litecoin Tech Support expressed their support for the PoK event and offered free help during the day, but they also said that “this event will have incredible upward pressure on bitcoin price and will force exchanges to hold more ample supplies of cryptos,” and added: “Imagine 2025 after the 2024 BTC halving, this event alone could create a real supply shock!!”For the end, here are more celebratory tweets and jokes:Happy bitcoin genesis day #__Happy Birthday, Bitcoin! ♥️__Today Bitcoin turns 11!Happy Birthday Bitcoin and happy proof of key day.Our love for you grows more with each passing day and still, you don't care :) pic.twitter.com/EqdWGZtmPN__11AB - Anno Bitcoin__....;£íýz{.²zÇ,>gv.a.È.ÃˆŠQ2:Ÿ¸ªK.^J)«_Iÿÿ...¬+|......................................ÿÿÿÿM.ÿÿ....EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banksÿÿÿÿ..ò.*....CA.gŠý°þUH'.gñ¦q0·.\Ö¨(à9.¦ybàê.aÞ¶Iö¼?Lï8ÄóU.å.Á.Þ\8M÷º..WŠLp+kñ._¬....__Happy birthday #Bitcoin!

January 05, 2020
","Bricks and mortar shops began to struggle as soon as ecommerce started to gain traction. Today, online shopping has become the norm for many consumers. It is estimated that globally, over 1.9 billion people have made online purchases in 2019. Conversely, thousands of physical stores are experiencing a drop in sales, which has led to store closures and even bankruptcies. Analysts have coined this phenomenon the “retail apocalypse.”  ","In this article, we will discuss this trend and the potential role that digital currencies could play in a predominantly digital retail market. The “retail apocalypse” refers to the close of physical stores in the U.S. (especially of larger chains) as a result of changing consumer behavior and the rise of ecommerce. The term “retail apocalypse” first appeared in 2017 following the closure of a large number of bricks and mortar stores by major retailers as well as several high-profile retail bankruptcies. Analysts at the investment bank UBS predict that an estimated 75,000 shops that sell consumer electronics, furniture, and clothing will close their doors by 2026. At that point, ecommerce is expected to make up around 25% of retail sales.In the list of major retailers that have closed hundreds of physical stores reads like the who’s who of American retail. Radio Shack (1,470 store closures), Toys R Us (735 store closures), and GNC (700 store closures) are examples of retailers who have suffered as a result of the “retail apocalypse.” Since 2017, over 15,000 bricks and mortar shops have been closed, according to UBS. As the world goes digital, it is hard to envision a future where online shopping does not make up a majority of retail sales. Nationwide same-day drone delivery (and probably also returns) are estimated to become the norm while consumers are spending more time in front of screens than ever. The question for cryptocurrency advocates, users, and investors is whether decentralized digital currencies could end up as one of the major beneficiaries of the retail apocalypse or not.Despite the many benefits that cryptocurrency has as an online payment system, bitcoin (BTC) has not managed to successfully penetrate the online retail market in the first decade of its existence. While there are several online retailers that accept bitcoin, the list is much shorter than the list of retailers who accept PayPal, for example. The reasons why bitcoin has not (yet) managed to succeed as a transactional currency for online payments is partly due to its volatility but mainly because of bitcoin users’ strong propensity to “HODL,” or reluctance to spend cryptocurrency hoping it will rise in value. The lack of major retailers that accept the digital currency is, of course, another factor why mainstream adoption as a payment method is still years away. However, the retail apocalypse may change that.As shoppers move online and cryptocurrency adoption increases across the globe, the coming years could see more crypto-holding consumers make online purchases using digital currency. Should the option to pay in digital currency become more readily available, we could expect more cryptocurrency use among online shoppers. “It sure will. Crypto is an excellent use-case for online payments specifically,” Yousef Abdulhassan, founder and CEO of the crypto-powered ecommerce platform CoinMall, told Cryptonews.com.Meanwhile, Dylan Bathurst, founder of the Lightning Network-powered get-paid-for-your-data app Trakkin.me, says he does not believe in the retail apocalypse.“I think it’s just kind of a generational shift to online, but then people will want an in-person experience and move back to offline. But I do think online shopping will eventually dominate. Bitcoin indirectly benefits from that being that there are just more online payments happening, there will be more bitcoin payments happening,” Bathurst told Cryptonews.com, adding that bitcoin itself is still in a store of value stage now and will be for a while.However, according to him, as Lightning Network develops, we’re seeing new and interesting use cases for bitcoin and “I think the future is bright there.”Perhaps the bigger question than whether crypto will benefit from the “retail apocalypse” or not is whether it will be “real” cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or fiat-currency pegged stablecoins that will win the race to become the go-to online spending digital currency.While bitcoin (and altcoin) users are faced with price volatility and a reluctance by retailers to accept crypto as a payment method, fiat currency-backed stablecoins may end up leading the pack of digital spending currencies as businesses are already comfortable with accepting fiat currency in digital form.CoinMall CEO Abdulhassan disagrees.“The most liquid and most widely adopted coin will win, which currently is bitcoin. I don't think that'll change any time soon either, since buyers don't want to go through the hassle of exchanging their BTC to whichever other coin just to make a payment,” he said. Meanwhile, according to Bathurst, stablecoins still have a lot of the same challenges bitcoin has in terms of user onboarding (get a wallet, sign transactions, etc). “So, I really don’t see them as helping ecommerce but, instead, as a way of helping people with large crypto holdings to hedge market volatility,” he said.It is difficult to predict to what extent more shoppers moving online will impact cryptocurrency adoption and usage. While online shopping provides an excellent use case for digital currencies, they are yet to reach critical mass as an online payment method. Having said that, bitcoin has gone a long way in just one decade. So, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise if it eventually ends up as one of the go-to digital payment options.

February 02, 2020
","It’s no secret that Bitcoin has issues when it comes to privacy. After all, it’s pretty difficult to implement privacy features in a system that puts the entire history of transactions on a public ledger for everyone to see.","That said, improvements to Bitcoin privacy have been slowly implemented over time. And the two wallets pushing the limits of privacy in Bitcoin more than anyone else these days are Samourai Wallet and Wasabi Wallet.While these two wallets have similar goals, they use a variety of different methods to improve privacy for their users. And these differences have led to a rather nasty feud between the two projects.Both wallets have their supporters, and Cryptonews.com reached out to developers from both projects to see what they’re working on in 2020.For the pseudonymous developer known as TDevD on Twitter, the focus for Samourai Wallet in 2020 will be on continuing to offer new enhancements in terms of on-chain transaction privacy.“Privacy is moving to the forefront of considerations in the Bitcoin space and 2020 will see Samourai Wallet double down with regards to on-chain privacy,” said TDevD.Samourai Wallet’s CoinJoin (a method for combining multiple Bitcoin payments into a single transaction) implementation, known as Whirlpool, has been available in desktop software since the second quarter of 2019. Currently, a mobile version of the privacy feature is available to a select group of Samourai Wallet users, and this functionality should be opened up to the general Samourai userbase in the coming weeks.“Whirlpool mobile mixing will be rolled out to general release within the next few weeks allowing users to participate in rapid rounds of Chaumian CoinJoin on their Android device,” said TDevD. “The update will include full coin control and tools to mitigate the issues arising from the handling of toxic change outputs. Recent events in the Bitcoin space have shown how post-mix behavior can compromise mixing, damage privacy, and endanger users. Samourai post-mix tools will evolve to further reinforce segregation of mixed UTXOs [unspent transaction outputs] as well as act as safeguards against user faux-pas.”Samourai Wallet developers are also working on a new addition to their Cahoots feature. It will allow users with no available counterparty to partake in a joined spend intended to destroy the assumption by blockchain analytics firms that spends from multiple addresses come from a single user.Additionally, Samourai Wallet will see improvements in terms of automated coin selection for enhanced privacy in 2020.“In 2020 all Samourai spends will benefit from the release of our revamped UTXO selection engine designed to provide optimal selection of UTXOs based on past history of UTXO and type of spend,” said TDevD.All of these improvements for privacy in Samourai Wallet will also be tightly integrated into the associated Dojo full node software.“The grassroots ecosystem that has emerged around Dojo will continue to customize and extend Dojo for various hardware platforms,” added TDevD.For Wasabi Wallet developers, the vision for 2020 is a bit less clear, at least for now. At the start of the year, the Wasabi Research Club was created. This is a weekly meeting held via Google Hangouts where various privacy improvement proposals are presented and discussed. So far this year, the research club has looked into Knapsack Mixing, SNICKER, CoinShuffle, and Dining Cryptographers.In terms of what will eventually come out of this extensive research into potential privacy enhancements for the Bitcoin wallet, Wasabi Wallet Lead Maintainer Adam Fiscor told Cryptonews.com: “The most likely thing we'll work on is most efficient mixing in terms of blockspace used per anonymity gained, but again we're in an exploration phase right now.”Fiscor expanded on his thoughts on the roadmap for improved privacy for Bitcoin in 2020 and beyond during the January 20th meeting of the Wasabi Research Club.“The second thing to do is to figure out how to send money in a mix instead of sending to yourself, mixing to yourself,” said Fiscor. “The third thing to do is, after these things are figured out, we have to figure out how to do it trustlessly. The fourth thing to do is figure out how to do it in a decentralized way, which I am not interested in – but for completeness this is something people might be interested in. And the fifth thing to do is figure out how to integrate other infrastructures into this new mixing technology that has been researched.”The “other infrastructures” Fiscor referred to would be things like hardware wallets, lite clients, and the Lightning Network.The Bitcoin network itself is also expected to gain new tools for privacy-focused developers in the form of the Schnorr, Taproot, and Tapscript upgrade. However, it’s unclear if these new enhancements will be made available for wallet developers in 2020.For now, developers like TDevD and Fiscor are focused on building tools that make it easy to use Bitcoin in a private manner.“I don't think it's hard to use Bitcoin privately,” said Fiscor. “At least not with Wasabi. Sure, you can go into endless nuances here, but in general, it's not that difficult already. And it's only going to get better.”____Learn more: 15 Online Tools for Crypto-Anarchists, Privacy Advocates, And Agorists"

January 14, 2020
","Rumors about the self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright have seemingly fuelled a rally of more than 100% in Bitcoin SV (BSV) – the cryptocurrency backed by Wright – over the past seven days.","A rise of 43% was recorded during the past 24 hours alone, making Bitcoin SV the best-performing coin among the top 50 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At pixel time (14:02 UTC), BSV, ranked 6th by market capitalization, trades at c. USD 233.Although Bitcoin SV has been in an uptrend since late December, the specific driver for the most recent explosive rally appears to be screenshots of a chat with Craig Wright that are circulating online.According to the screenshots, posted on Twitter by, among others, Arthur van Pelt, co-founder of fintech company Dragon Industries, Wright appears to confirm that he has received the final part of a private key from the so-called Tulip Trust. The key is said to be able to unlock more than one million bitcoins (BTC) that were allegedly mined during the early days of the original cryptocurrency.The screenshots, which appears to be from a Slack chat, shows Wright saying “Next week we file” and “already arrived,” which likely refers to the missing part of the key, and his intention to file this with a Florida court next week.However, Pelt also tweeted a clear warning with the screenshots, saying “This is nothing less than a fabricated scam, a pump 'n' dump orchestrated by the people on the helm.” And don't get me wrong here. This is nothing less than a fabricated scam, a pump 'n' dump orchestrated by the peopl… https://t.co/UR28Koect4As reported back in May of 2019, a pump-and-dump situation occurred in Bitcoin SV at the time, which was largely attributed to fake news circulating in China. The fake news report back then claimed that Craig Wright had successfully proved that he is Satoshi, and that Binance would again list Bitcoin SV on its exchange. Also in May of 2019, BSV rallied almost 70% in a day on news that Wright filed registrations with the U.S. Copyright Office and has been granted U.S. copyright registrations for the original Bitcoin white paper and Bitcoin code (version 0.1).After the rally in May, the price moved up in June also, before losing almost 50% of its value in July. Today, BSV is up by more than 200% in a year.BSV price chart:"

",An American store manager was left baffled after thieves executed a sophisticated plan to steal a Bitcoin ATM that “wasn’t doing well” – leaving a cash-filled conventional ATM behind.,"Police in Philidelphia said two men used crowbars to break open a “Bitcoin machine” in the early hours of January 21, and released video surveillance footage of the incident.The video shows the two men arriving in a car, then entering the Quick Mart store in the Mayfair district of the city and prying open the machine to remove what appears to be a cash box from the device – before driving away.Police are still searching for the suspects, but the store manager suggested that the robbers may have made the wrong choice.CBS Local quotes the manager, Hashid Alsaidi, as stating that “what surprised him” is the fact that the robbers “didn’t touch the [conventional] ATM that was within arms’ reach.”Alsaidi said the Bitcoin ATM “isn’t very popular” and did not believe the raiders “made away with much.”He said,“Honestly, it wasn’t doing good anyway.”However, it seems the attackers knew a thing or two about Bitcoin and the inner workings of crypto ATMs.The manager added,“They looked like they knew what they were doing. It was so fast […] They came and they just popped it open.”As Bitcoin ATMs become more commonplace, it seems more thieves are targeting the machines – although some of these criminal early adopters have been more successful than others. Canadian raiders left behind a bumper haul of USD 38,000 in a November robbery last year.And two American thieves walked out of a Washington shopping mall with a Bitcoin ATM wrapped in a blanket in August 2019."

January 04, 2020
","Pretty much everyone in the developed world has heard of Bitcoin (BTC) by now. It's been featured in countless news articles and bulletins, and it's been discussed by business leaders, economists, celebrities, and the general public.","The question is: has the coverage it's received actually been good for its development, and has it and its benefits been communicated effectively by everyone – PR (public relations) companies, entrepreneurs, startups, developers, trade associations – working in the decentralized Bitcoin and wider crypto industry?Well, as with most things in life, the answer to this question is mixed. Up until now, the mainstream media has usually been either sceptical towards Bitcoin or downright dismissive, but while the crypto industry has had varying success in challenging the dominant narratives surrounding the cryptocurrency, it is steadily getting better at communicating the message that Bitcoin is a transformative invention.Regardless of whether it has received a bad rap from the media, there's no doubt that Bitcoin has succeeded in forcing people to sit up and take notice.""Love it or loathe it, Bitcoin is an international phenomenon,"" affirms Liam Murphy, director at blockchain PR company Wachsman. ""Bitcoin's rise in the public consciousness has been quite something; let's remember that this all began with an obscure white paper posted online.""Much of Bitcoin's rise to the status of ""international phenomenon"" has come about irrespective of what journalists, PR professionals and economists have said about it. That's because, as soon as it started witnessing above-average price gains, investors began flocking to it, hopeful of sharing in its rise.""I’d say Bitcoin has been exposed to the full-blast impact of WOM (Word of Mouth), which tends to cause the highs to be very high and the lows to be extremely low,"" explains Alona Stein, an account director at tech-focused PR firm Blonde20. ""Basically, uncontrolled, unmanaged exposure starts fires, especially when there’s direct financial gain at stake, as well as the FOMO [fear of missing out] factor.""Of course, while Bitcoin's meteoric rise(s) in value attracted lots of attention, it was met largely with scorn and derision by much of the media. Journalists and newspapers highlighted its volatility, emphasized the apparent susceptibility of the Bitcoin market to manipulation, and even claimed that Bitcoin was basically one big glorified Ponzi scheme.At the same time, they neglected the potentially revolutionary nature of its decentralized monetary system. To an extent, they were able to get away with this distorted account of Bitcoin because advocates of the cryptocurrency were too slow in organizing their efforts to present it in a more positive light.""If there had been a proper PR campaign to introduce Bitcoin as a concept to mainstream audiences, its advantages and potential would have been communicated effectively, but that wasn’t the case,"" says Alona Stein. ""PR work around messaging, gradual market education and exposure would have better controlled Bitcoin’s image over time.""Other individuals working in the crypto PR industry agree with this assessment. ""In respect to effectively communicating Bitcoin’s advantages to the general public, I’d say that’s another objective that has still not been achieved in a meaningful way,"" says Katie Olver, CEO of Cryptoland PR.At present, it would be inaccurate to refer to Bitcoin as a 'PR project' in any unified sense. There's no single group or party that's more responsible for Bitcoin's current public image than any other group or party, with various different corners contributing to its overall profile.""There is no individual, body, or grouping responsible for the current public perception of Bitcoin. Regulators, enterprise, startups, the media, commentators, public relations professionals, the public, all contribute to the debate around Bitcoin and that's healthy,"" says Liam Murphy.However, even if people within the crypto industry are having more input in how Bitcoin is perceived (particularly with the growth of crypto-specific news outlets), Katie Oliver thinks that the mainstream media still have the biggest influence on the cryptocurrency's public persona.""Bitcoin’s perception is certainly still heavily influenced by reporting by mainstream media,"" she says. ""You only need to look at the hugely popular BBC Missing Cryptoqueen podcast series covering the OneCoin USD 4 billion cryptocurrency scam. It’s been streamed over 1m times, bringing awareness of another cryptocurrency scam to light.""""We’re in the midst of the Bitcoin evolution, and we’re about to enter the next step,"" predicts Alona Stein. ""Now that we’ve all been living in this industry for a while, I would expect PR firms, industry thought leaders, and the media to be more responsible about how they communicate their forecasts, opinions, and promises.”“Crypto companies, just as other startups and companies, will always need a strong vision to bring in investors and to grow their business,"" she adds.Put differently, if the crypto industry wants to communicate the positive side of Bitcoin more effectively, it needs to focus less on the bad aspects of crypto  – the scams, the shitcoins, the sensationalist promises of profit – and more on what crypto and Bitcoin have to offer that's of genuine value.As Liam Murphy sums up, ""Bitcoin should be recognised for having taken a generationally significant step forward by relying on the 'blockchain'. Bitcoin created a currency ecosystem, however imperfect, that was not centrally controlled, yet allowed users trust one another, without gatekeepers, an extraordinary feat."""

","Bitcoin.com, an operator of a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) mining pool, said it will not support the so-called “dev tax” and will be working on another plan. However, some developers warn that the “dev tax” might still be implemented. ","“The dev tax is wounded, but not dead,” developer Peter Rizun, who is against the proposal, told Bloomberg. He pointed out that many key miners support the proposal, and could still implement it on May 15. Meanwhile, Bitcoin.com, led by Roger Ver, stressed that “this is a great opportunity for developers to clarify what they need funding for, and provide the specific budgets and timelines they have for their work.”According to the pool operator, any new proposal will need to have as many people of economic weight on-board as possible, including businesses, exchanges, miners, and Bitcoin Cash implementations.As reported, Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of one of the largest mining pools on BCH, BTC.TOP, offered to direct 12.5% of mining rewards to support the BCH infrastructure over a six-month period. Zhuoer's post included a threat to orphan the noncomplying BCH blocks (those blocks would no longer be included in the BCH blockchain, leaving a miner without the reward). Besides BTC.TOP, the proposal was signed by other large mining pools: Antpool, ViaBTC, BTC.com, and Bitcoin.com, until the latter revoked its support on Tuesday.The response from the vast majority of miners was negative, including dramatic calls for a massive exodus from the coin. The main issue, according to the critiques, was based on centralization. Such taxes would quickly create a wholly centralized infrastructure for the coin, leaving miners voting out in the cold. The average number of developers working each month on Bitcoin Cash-related projects declined 32% in the first half of 2019, or most of all other top cryptocurrencies, according to Electric Capital."

","If you’ve got high-level IT skills and fancy making a cool USD 250 thousand, one company wants to hear from you. All you need to do is break into their crypto wallet – and make away with thousands of dollars’ worth of Bitcoin.","But the firm says the task won’t be an easy one, as they believe the wallet to be “unhackable.” The company in question is startup GK8, run by two former Israeli national cybersecurity experts. The duo established GK8 in 2018, previously worked together in the Office of the Israeli Prime Minister, where were charged with protecting the nation’s strategic assets against cyber-attacks – and say they have applied their skills to creating hack-proof wallets.The company also has an advisory board that includes cryptography experts such as Zcash founding scientist, Professor Eran Tromer, and the former head of an Israeli intelligence cybersecurity unit.  GK8 says the wallet in question contains some USD 125,000 worth of Bitcoin and will give would-be hackers 24 hours to break into the account from 09:00 a.m. EST on February 3.There is one caveat, though. The Tel Aviv-based company has stipulated that would-be hackers will need to pre-register in the event.And if you are successful, you will need to let GK8 know exactly how you broke into the account if you want to collect the lucrative prize.The move is an unconventional promotion for the company’s cold wallet solution, a so-called “hack-proof digital vault.”Last year, the startup launched a cold wallet it says it has enabled with “hot” online transfer capacities.GK8 says its deep cold-wallet infrastructure allows for hot wallet functionalities even without an inbound network connection, thus “eliminating cyber-attack vulnerabilities.”The Israeli firm completed a seed funding round in September 2019, raising some USD 4 million from investors including Marius Nacht, the co-founder of cybersecurity company Check Point, as well as venture capital and angel investment platform iAngels, blockchain venture capital firm Eden Block, private security and intelligence firm IDEAL-HLS, the government-run Israel Innovation Authority and software developer StratX.Media outlet Globes reported at the time that the company claimed it was “already securing customers who manage around USD 1 billion for global clients, protected by 5 patents.”"

February 09, 2020
","It is no longer a secret that bitcoin (BTC) is the best performing asset of the last decade. However, in light of bitcoin’s volatility, many traditional investors are skeptical about how beneficial adding bitcoin to their portfolio would be for their returns. ","In the following analysis, we will look at how a traditional portfolio - composed of stocks and bonds - would have performed if bitcoin was added as a constituent. To analyze what the impact of bitcoin would be on a traditional investment portfolio, we build a model portfolio that is composed of stocks and bonds on an equally-weighted basis. Then, we will add 1%, 5% and 10% bitcoin exposure to the portfolio and see how it would have performed over the last one, three, and five years. As a proxy for our ROI (return on investment) calculations, we used the S&P 500 Index for stocks and US AAA-rated corporate debt for bonds. For bitcoin, we used the historic spot rate. This gives us the following 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year ROIs:Using these returns figures, we will calculate how our model portfolio would have performed if we had added 1%, 5%, and 10% bitcoin exposure and compare these results to an equally weighted stock and bond portfolio.  A stocks and bonds-only portfolio would have generated a total return of 19.40%, 17.43% and 16.59% over a one-year, three-year, and five-year investment horizon respectively. Adding only one percent of bitcoin into our model portfolio also boosts historical ROI quite substantially. In all three of our chosen time horizons, our 1% BTC portfolio has generated higher returns than the stocks and bonds-only portfolio. In light of bitcoin’s often talked about volatility, this may come somewhat as a surprise. Our 1% Bitcoin model portfolio generated ROIs of 21%, 26%, and 57% over a one-year, three-year, and five-year investment horizon respectively. The difference in returns between the zero-bitcoin and the 1% bitcoin portfolio becomes especially apparent on a five-year time horizon where holding only one percent in BTC would have more than tripled returns. Adding 5% bitcoin exposure to our portfolio - an amount that many traditional investors would already consider aggressive - would have given our portfolio returns a significant boost. With returns of 26%, 60%, and 217% (!) over a one-year, three-year, and five-year time horizon, our 5% Bitcoin model portfolio would have aggressively outperformed the zero-bitcoin version of our portfolio. Unsurprisingly, our 10% Bitcoin Model Portfolio has the highest historic returns and would have generated a multiple in returns over a three and five-year period than our zero-bitcoin portfolio. Three-year and five-year portfolio RIOs would have been 102% and 418% respectively. These are the kind of returns that traditional investors - who (still) prefer stocks and bonds - can only dream of. For seasoned bitcoin investors, it will come as no surprise that adding bitcoin exposure to an investment portfolio would have substantially increased returns. Bitcoin has generated over a million percent ROI since it was launched in January 2009 and in the last five years, the price of the world’s first cryptocurrency is up by over 4,000%. While investing in stocks and bonds will most likely generate a decent investment return over a multi-year period, adding bitcoin will likely benefit returns more than harm them. At least, if historical ROI is anything to go by. Of course, every investor knows that historical performances do not guarantee future reasons. However, that does not change the fact that bitcoin (BTC) remains one of the most promising investments available in the market today. Stacking some sats alongside your traditional investments may turn out to be one of the best investment decisions in your life."

","The popular oft-debated narrative of Bitcoin (BTC) as a safe haven is being tested yet again, following the U.S. strike in Iran. (Updated at 17:00 UTC: updates in bold).","Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force, and Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis were killed in an air strike on their convoy in Baghdad airport by the U.S. airstrike late on Thursday, reports Reuters. Veteran war-zone correspondent and political analyst Elijah J. Magnier posted a Twitter thread saying, among other things, that Iran decided to respond to the assassination directly, that the U.S.'s moves are uniting Iraq and Iran against it, that all U.S. high-ranking personal could be potential targets for retaliation, and that Muqtada al-Sadr (an Iraqi Shia cleric, politician and militia leader) has given an order “to indicate his readiness for war against the US in Iraq.” Iranian journalist and activist Masih Alinejad shared, however, that Qassem Soleimani was not a hero for many Iranians, but a warmonger.The news of the attack has sent numerous waves throughout the geopolitical space and the financial world, reaching the Cryptoworld as well.The traditional market was swift to react to the news of the airstrike. Bloomberg reported on December 2 that, as tension between the U.S. and Iran escalated, stocks and American equity futures were sinking, while haven assets started rising, including gold, the yen, and treasuries. Gold rallied and West Texas oil jumped as much as 4.4%. The very next day, the media outlet said that gold rose to a four-month high, spot bullion climbed 0.9% to USD 1,542.47 an ounce, silver price increased 1.3%, platinum and palladium advanced, the yen strengthened 0.6% and oil jumped close to USD 70 a barrel. Interestingly, the air strike coincided with a quick dump and pump in the crypto market, possibly fuelling the discussions on safe havens.The charts show BTC dropping 3% on December 2 to USD 6,921 on December 3, which was quickly followed by a 5% jump, and seems to be still rising at the moment. At pixel time (10:37 UTC), BTC trades at c. USD 7,342 and is up by 3% in the past 24 hours and by almost 2% in a week.Bitcoin price chart:$BTC exhibiting some macro convergence today w/ Oil and Gold on the back of Iran geopolitical escalation https://t.co/QZFQltxLkyMany, like Matthew Graham, CEO of the advisory company Sino Global Capital, wondered if the price was moving as a reaction to the current geopolitical risks. There are those that apparently think that it might be so.But in the opinion of many online, this doesn’t seem to be the case. “BTC moved higher almost four hours after all other assets,” said  trader and economist Alex Krüger, “and before the move some where even discussing how bearish Iran news could be, possibly rationalizing the initial move lower.” Another commenter said that the market change looks “like a major player got liquidity, as many were short and their positions were liquidated.”The Bitcoin Market Makers just woke up and said ""oh shit we gotta pump this if we're going to keep the digital gold narrative alive.""""The case for BTC to rise in the face of Iranian geopolitical strife is certainly understood, however the Iranian market in and of itself is likely too small and slow to have caused this move single-handedly. More likely, one or several players have been waiting on the side for a good buying opportunity below USD 7,000 per coin and it seems one has presented itself,"" Mati Greenspan, Founder of Quantum Economics, said in its newsletter today. This is a type of an event that may cause a number of discussions over the world’s most popular cryptocurrency as a safe haven, exasperated by the rising tensions and rampant speculations. While some, like developer Udi Wertheimer, commented that World War III this month is possible, most people seem to think it unlikely. Important: The US has not gone to war with Iran.On the other hand, Krüger finds that the talk of BTC as safe haven and its price appreciating due to the attack in Iran is “absolute nonsense.” ""Round numbers are there to get run over, in both directions,"" he added, ""I have a small long so I'll be happy if speculators use the narrative to push prices up.""BREAKING: NO ONE IS GOING TO BUY BITCOIN BECAUSE OF A WAR WITH IRAN OTHER THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING BITCOIN BECAUS… https://t.co/Nyf4WAeG7zAs previously reported, this is a narrative which has gotten into some trouble before. And though it has been praised as an ‘unlikely sanctuary,’ others have claimed that there is no proof to support that narrative. Spencer Bogart, Blockchain Capital general partner, said  recently that, in the long-term, BTC would become a safe haven, as it currently remains at an intermediate stage of its evolution, when risks are taken into consideration, as well as attractive aspects.Meanwhile, investor Eric Dadoun commented that one shouldn’t celebrate over a bad event being a good opportunity for an investment.“The global economy is falling apart! This is good for my investment” 🤮“Real war may occur. This is good for my investment” 🤮Something being true doesn’t necessarily make it a good thing.Stop dancing.""Bitcoin and its brethren are risk assets, and they would be among the first to get market sold in the event of an uptick in global economic and regulatory uncertainty. That cyclical pain could be exacerbated by further crackdowns on the industry. Even threats of wholesale restrictions on crypto business activity and/or ownership would create existential fear for many current investors,"" according to Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto researcher Messari.There have already been efforts made in the crypto space that could theoretically enable Iran to evade United States sanctions, as the New York Times reported last year. As Iran’s economy has been staggered by banking sanctions, which also means that companies from other countries can’t do business in Iran, the difficult-to-trace transactions in Bitcoin could allow Iranians to make international payments, the article said.Also, as reported back in 2018, Iran was looking to dodge the U.S. sanctions via a digital currency, and also that the country allegedly gave the green light to cryptocurrency mining, with more crypto-friendly measures and legislation to follow. Then, in July 2019, we reported that a financial expert said cryptocurrencies are already playing a role in Iran’s fight against economic sanctions, and that the states’ government may turn to miners for additional assistance."

",Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees are returning to low levels amid an increased adoption of the Segregated Witness (SegWit) protocol on the network.,"“The majority of transactions now support SegWit, currently surpassing 55% on average. And while this marks a near 40% increase compared to the start of 2019, there is clearly more potential for SegWit adoption to grow on the Bitcoin network, which has this year been showing growing signs of congestions. Fees, however, have declined,” Luxembourg-based crypto exchange Bitstamp said in its recent report.In comparison, in the fourth quarter of 2018, SegWit’s adoption rate stood at below 40%, and in the fourth quarter of 2017, it barely surpassed the level of 10%. Owing to the rising number of SegWit transactions, median Bitcoin transaction fees stood at between USD 0.0742 and USD 0.67725 in 2019. Such a range has not been observed since 2016 when “the price of Bitcoin was at a fraction of where it stands today,” the report states. __After a bearish 2018, last year brought a new record in terms of Bitcoin transactions, at close to 120 million, the crypto exchange says.“During 2019, 80% of Bitcoin blocks were above the block limit of 1MB, with SegWit handling the additional weight,” according to Bitstamp. “More blocks over 1MB have been mined during 2019 than all of the previous year. And the possibility of hitting full blocks on average is becoming a close reality”.An optional protocol upgrade to blockchain networks, SegWit was first activated on Litecoin (LTC) in 2017, and it was subsequently adopted on the Bitcoin network.

Similarly, most major altcoins tested key supports and are currently (09:00 UTC) recovering, including ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, BNB, ADA, TRX and XLM. ETH/USD is now trading near the USD 130 resistance area. Besides, XRP/USD is correcting higher towards the USD 0.192 resistance.","Total market capitalization After another decline below USD 7,000, bitcoin price  found support near the USD 6,850 level. As a result, BTC/USD started a strong rise and recovered above the USD 7,000 and USD 7,100 levels. The price even spiked above USD 7,200 and it is currently consolidating near the USD 7,250 resistance area.
On the upside, the main resistance is near the USD 7,350 level, above which bitcoin price might continue to rise towards the USD 7,550 barrier. On the downside, there are supports near USD 7,100 and USD 7,050.Ethereum price  extended its decline below USD 128 and tested the USD 125 support. ETH/USD also started a decent recovery above USD 128 and it is currently trading near the USD 130 resistance. If there is a clear break above USD 130 and USD 132, there could be more gains towards the USD 135 resistance.
On the downside, the USD 128 level might act as a support. Any further losses may perhaps lead the price back towards the USD 125 support. The next major support is at USD 120.Bitcoin cash price  traded close to the USD 190 level before it reversed its losses. BCH/USD is recovering and it is now trading above the USD 200 level. If the price continues to rise above USD 205, there are chances of more gains towards the USD 215 level. On the downside, the USD 200 level may once again act as a decent support.
Litecoin  dived to test the USD 38.80 support area. LTC/USD reversed losses similar to bitcoin and it is now trading above USD 40.00. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 40.80 level, above which the price might accelerate towards the USD 42.00 level. 
XRP price  tested the USD 0.185 support level before staging a rebound. XRP/USD corrected above the USD 0.188 level and it is now trading near USD 0.190. On the upside, the bulls need to clear the USD 0.192 resistance area to continue higher. On the downside, the key supports are near USD 0.185.In the past three sessions, a few small capitalization altcoins recovered more than 5%, including BST, NEXO, KCS, XMR, MANA and ALGO. Out of these, BST rallied around 300% and moved to the 81st position by market capitalization. Overall, bitcoin price is showing positive signs above USD 7,100 and it was clearly rejected near the USD 6,850 support area.

January 14, 2020
","If the major digital assets, bitcoin (BTC) included, can’t prompt another bull market in 2020, exchange-based tokens may decline due to the possible trading volume shrinkage, says TokenInsight, a token data and rating agency. ","Their latest annual report on the cryptocurrency spot exchange industry explains that the price trend of exchange-based tokens “has a synchronous relationship” with bitcoin. But also, as exchanges hold a stable profit model in the current crypto-assets industry, their tokens can go higher when there’s a massive trading volume, typically with BTC’s price going up as well. Hence, concludes TokenInsight, if BTC and other main altcoins cannot start a bull market in 2020, the price of exchange-based tokens may continue to be affected by the volume shrinkage.Many exchange-based tokens had seen a positive performance in 2019, with mechanisms like token buy-back or burn pushing the price upwards. Exchange-based tokens showed a continuous upward trend in Q1 and Q2, and their prices remained relatively high even during the price decline in Q2 and Q3. Meanwhile, as reported by Cryptonews.com, this year, we're likely to see a range of crypto-exchanges diversifying into new services and functionality. For the most part, such diversification will be part of an attempt to offer a range of trading options that will attract institutional investors and corporate clients, the kind which generally bring the bigger bucks.TokenInsight also said that following a 28% decline in trading volume in Q4, since the profit margin of spot trading mainly depends on the continuous increase of digital asset prices, if the market continues to be depressed as currently expected, the centralized exchange industry will be under pressure for a longer period. However, the development of decentralized exchanges needs to wait for cross-chain technology breakthroughs or the overall maturity of the blockchain industry, they added."

","Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.
","Are you a latecomer to the bitcoin rush in 2019? Unless you have deep pockets, getting your hands on some bitcoins these days is not that easy. Mining used to be the go-to method if you wanted to get your hands on bitcoins on a regular basis. But with competition heating up, the cost of bitcoin mining has also skyrocketed. But fear not, because there is a hack for pretty much every situation in life, and bitcoins are no different. Here are a few ways to generate bitcoins online without mining or investing: 1. Sell products for bitcoinThis is a great option if you are already dabbling in online retail/e-commerce. You can add bitcoins to your existing payment methods. The great thing about this path is that your options are pretty much unlimited. In the world of online retail, you can find buyers for pretty much anything, including: ●	Jewelry and DIY products
●	Furniture and woodworking
●	Gadgets
●	Software and apps 
●	Food delivery Though the big ones like Amazon don’t allow bitcoin payments, there are a fair few online platforms that do allow sellers to accept crypto payments. These include:●	Overstock
●	Dish
●	eGifter
●	NeweggSelling for bitcoin is different from selling for fiat currency like dollars or Euros. In 2010, you could order a couple of pizzas with 10k bitcoins. Now, that same 10k is worth a whopping $90+ million! The moral of the story is this: when you get your hands on some bitcoin, hold them for the long term. You have no idea how rich you could get in just a couple of years! Consider any income you make in bitcoins as part of your retirement plan. 2. Work for bitcoinsThis is similar to method no. 1, but more in the services sector. It is ideal if you don’t have any products to sell, but have “a certain set of skills.”No, we are not talking about hunting down bad guys or anything Liam Neeson style (!), but rather, more mundane tasks and chores. Freelancing is a growing global phenomenon that is here for the long haul. If you are willing to work for short term gigs and one time contracts, there are plenty of tasks out there. Firms these days are looking for qualified freelancers to handle stuff like: ●	writing code 
●	data analysis 
●	secretarial tasks 
●	delivery 
●	graphic designing There are multiple platforms online that advertise this kind of work. And many of them also offer payments in bitcoins. But since this is not mainstream currency, you will not find them that easily. Social media platforms like Reddit are a great place to start looking for such gigs. Boards like Jobs4Bitcoin are filled with postings from community members but there are fewer jobs here than at regular boards. If you want a more professional platform, look no further than Coinality. It is a dedicated online platform for contracts and gigs that pay exclusively in bitcoin. If you have any software and tech skills, this is a great platform as many startups are looking for freelancers here. Just be careful before taking up an assignment. Do some research on the firms posting the ads on these sites. If they look legit and have some good reviews on sites like Glassdoor, go ahead and work for those guys. 3. Earn bitcoins doing simple online tasksIf you lack any advanced tech skills or products to sell, you have some other simple ways to earn bitcoin online. The downside with these options is the slow rate at which you will be able to collect coins. There are several websites that offer you small amounts of bitcoins for doing simple tasks. These include:●	Watching videos
●	Looking at ads
●	Visiting certain sites
●	Performing simple analytics 
●	Testing out certain functions
●	Doing surveys
●	Referrals For most of these tasks, the sites will offer you small token amounts, usually in mBTC. Some popular options websites that offer such tasks include:●	BitcoinGet
●	Bitvisitor
●	QoinPro
●	FreeBitco.in   If you are blessed with a flair for writing, you can even write articles and post them online at special platforms. Articles that get read and shared the most can get paid in bitcoins. Yours.org is a site that specializes in this sort of thing. Visitors at the site can vote on your articles and even purchase them for the asking price. You could earn anywhere from $10 to $30 per article if you are really good at crafting interesting content.  4. Online casino gamblingAll the other options involve some kind of work or effort. How would you like to earn some bitcoin while having a blast at a casino? We are not pulling your leg here. Bitcoins casinos are a thing in the online gambling world and they do offer bonuses to new players in cryptocurrencies. Online gambling is a growing pastime around the world. Many players demand maximum privacy while playing casino games, for reasons that are pretty much self-explanatory. Unlike other payment options like credit cards and banks, bitcoin wallets offer maximum secrecy and anonymity. These days many casinos encourage players to wager in bitcoins by offering special offers and bonuses. No deposit bonuses are amazing as they actually give you free cash to wager on the casino’s games. You don’t even have to pay the casino anything to get this bonus. Finding no deposit promotions that involve bitcoins is not too hard. There are many online casinos that offer transactions almost exclusively in bitcoins and other alt-coins. Called crypto casinos, these are your best bet when it comes to free bitcoins. Then there are regular online casinos that also accept deposits in bitcoins. Some of these may also offer bonuses involving bitcoin, but they tend to be quite rare. Like any other shortcut/hack to earning bitcoin without mining, gambling too has its pitfalls. After all, everything here is dependent on luck. If you get caught up in the rush of wagering, you could end up seriously in the red. So be careful when you sign up at any online casino. Look around for no deposit bonuses and try to quit when you are still winning!So what do we do now?The number of bitcoins in the world is expected to stay at 21 million for the foreseeable future. With such finite supply, the value of bitcoins will remain always high, no matter how many new altcoins enter the picture. This is why you should never give up on bitcoins. Their value may fluctuate with market demand, but it is always a good option to stow away a few coins in a wallet somewhere. You never know when the next boom cycle is going to come!"

",Yet another step forward in the institutional adoption of bitcoin will be taken today with the launch of the much-anticipated bitcoin options market by the major financial derivatives marketplace Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME).

Now we're getting actual derivatives to trade. Majority of… https://t.co/I5vAEvqQUHAs reported, CME Group is adding bitcoin options based on its existing bitcoin futures contracts. Options are tradeable securities that give the holder an option, but not an obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset – in this case, bitcoin futures contracts – at a given price and at a predetermined date in the future. Options are thus unlike futures contracts, which, at their expiration date, obligates the holder to take delivery of the underlying asset. Both options and futures are leveraged products that are popular among financial institutions and professional traders.Meanwhile, on January 9, major crypto exchange OKEx announced that their BTCUSD Options trading went live.Also, crypto derivatives trading platform FTX says it has launched Bitcoin options trading. The company’s CEO took to Twitter over the weekend to claim, “Options are live!” FTX later claimed that options trading volume on the platform had hit the USD 1 million mark in around two hours."

","The derivatives and equities trading company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange and Bakkt, reportedly made a takeover offer to e-commerce giant eBay, which doesn't seem to have borne fruit. Nonetheless, the Cryptoverse has been speculating what would such a takeover mean for crypto. ","The Wall Street Journal reported on the takeover offer that would value the company more than USD 30 billion, compared to its current market capitalization of USD 29.7 billion. The report added that ICE approached eBay before, but that the two giants are not in formal talks.ICE's statement followed promptly, saying that it did approach eBay ""to explore a range of potential opportunities that might create value for the shareholders of both companies,"" but that ""eBay has not engaged in a meaningful way. We are not in negotiations regarding the sale of all or part of eBay,"" ICE concluded. eBay's stock jumped 13.6% following this report, while ICE's (with the market capitalisation of USD 51.5 billion) dropped 7.47% in the past day. The takeover would be unexpected as ICE is known for dealing with financial services and eBay with consumer goods. However, what would it mean for crypto?ICE is already involved in trading and storage of digital assets, as it's the parent company of the U.S.-based physically-settled Bitcoin derivatives trading platform Bakkt. At such, it's certainly in ICE's interest to promote it and digital assets through any possible avenue.WHOA.The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is thinking about taking over eBay at a valuation of more than $30 billion.This is the same company that realized the importance of Bitcoin enough to start Bakkt.Would be incredible to combine NYSE, Bakkt, & eBay under one roof.Financial Times writes that the company could use eBay to potentially build a ""cyber currency trading platform,"" citing Brad Bailey, research director at capital markets consultancy Celent, who said that: “There is no limit to the potential for new derivative and data products. The future of the capital markets will be defined by new, effective ways of defining what a trading platform is and what it trades, whether in bitcoin, home decor or powertools.”Furthermore, in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, stock exchanges and institutional investors may want to diversify their holdings. They might be prompted to include crypto by the legitimacy provided by these two giants, as well as by ICE's successes. Some commenters online are wondering what'd be like having the option on eBay to pay in bitcoin (BTC), given that the platform has 183 million active buyers worldwide. Others, however, worried about possible centralization of crypto, as well as eBay's alleged inability to adapt.More comments: That thought hadn’t crossed my mind but yes that would be great for the commerce arm of our ecosystem__If eBay uses bakkt to process bitcoin that might be enough for bitcoin to go mainstreamMeanwhile, in May 2019, eBay, responding to speculation in the market, told Cryptonews.com that it is not allowing payments to be made in cryptocurrency and is not working on that option at all at the moment."

A new 2020 high is formed near USD 9,000 and the price is currently (09:00 UTC) trading with a bullish angle.","Similarly, there were decent gains in most major altcoins, including ethereum, XRP, bitcoin cash, litecoin, EOS, BNB, ADA, TRX, ETC, and XLM. ETH/USD is up around 8% and it broke the USD 166 and USD 170 resistance levels. XRP/USD is also gaining traction and it recently surpassed the USD 0.232 resistance area.Total market capitalization Recently, bitcoin price  started a fresh increase above the USD 8,650 and USD 8,700 resistance levels. More importantly, BTC/USD surpassed the USD 8,850 resistance area and climbed to a new 2020 high. The price is currently showing a lot of positive signs and it seems like it could rise further towards the USD 9,250 and USD 9,300 levels.
On the downside, the USD 8,850 and USD 8,700 levels are likely to provide support. If there are more downsides, the price is likely to revisit the main USD 8,550 support area in the near term.Ethereum price  is gaining bullish momentum from the USD 160 support. ETH/USD surged above the USD 166 and USD 170 resistance levels. It seems like the bulls are now aiming a clear break above the USD 175 and USD 178 levels in the coming sessions.
On the downside, the previous resistance near USD 166 is likely to act as a buy zone. If there is a fresh decline below USD 166, the bulls are likely to struggle to hold the USD 158 support.Bitcoin cash price  remained well bid above the USD 320 support area. BCH/USD is currently surging and trading above the USD 340 resistance. If there are more upsides, there are chances of a break above the USD 355 and USD 360 resistance levels. On the downside, the main supports are near USD 335 and USD 320.
Litecoin  started a fresh upward move above the USD 58.50 and USD 59.20 resistance levels. LTC/USD is up around 8% and it is now trading above the USD 60.00 level. The next target for the bulls in the short term could be USD 62.20. On the downside, the USD 58.50 is a strong support.
XRP price  regained bullish momentum and climbed above the USD 0.228 and USD 0.232 resistance levels. XRP/USD is likely to continue higher above USD 0.236 and USD 0.238. Besides, a clear break above USD 0.240 could start a solid rally towards USD 0.250.In the past three sessions, many small capitalization altcoins gained more than 10%, including ETC, MONA, MATIC, ATOM, LINK, DCR, BCN, XTZ, XEM, ARDR, GRIN, ICX, ZEC, and NEXO. Out of these, ETC surged nearly 30% and MONA is up around 25% today. To sum up, bitcoin is trading in a solid uptrend above USD 8,550 and USD 8,650. A daily close above the USD 9,000 resistance level could set the pace for more upsides in BTC/USD towards USD 9,300 or even USD 9,500 in the coming sessions."

January 10, 2020
",Major financial derivatives marketplace Chicago Mercantile Exchange Group (CME) is seemingly ready to launch its long-awaited options on Bitcoin (BTC) futures on January 13. ,"As BTC's market capitalization is growing, a number of options to trade this cryptocurrency is growing as well. We may not see ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in the U.S. for a while longer due to regulatory concerns, but Bitcoin options might also help bring more investors into this market. Options are financial derivatives that provide the holder with the right to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on a predetermined date, but without the obligation to do so. This means that options allow the speculators among us to bet on a price rise or decline of an underlying asset using leverage.On Monday, options on Bitcoin futures, with one contract representing BTC 5, offered by CME Group will be available for trading, which will enable greater flexibility in managing Bitcoin price risk and saving on potential margin offsets between Bitcoin futures and options, while mitigating risk of counterparty default through central CME Clearing, among other things, states the exchange's website. As they've posted a reminder of the upcoming launch, it would suggest that everything's going according to plan. As reported in September, CME Group said it aims to launch options on Bitcoin futures in the first quarter of 2020, listing the benefits of the options. These include their usage like insurance policies to limit losses on a futures contract, for speculative purposes, as hedging instruments, and for efficiently deploying capital in the form of option premium. The January date was then announced in November, providing specific details about the upcoming contracts. In general, the extreme volatility in the crypto market is frightening to almost any type of investor but, as we discussed, it may be an attractive opportunity for volatility traders who often use popular strategies straddle and strange to trade volatility.Additionally, what we're also seeing is an increasing acceptance of Bitcoin options by regulators and traditional institutions in general. In July 2017, a battle was won when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved LedgerX to be registered as a swap execution facility and derivatives clearing organization, while in June 2019, it approved the application of LedgerX as a designated contract market. LedgerX is one of the trading platforms where Bitcoin options are already available, along with Deribit, Quedex, and others, while the Cryptoverse is waiting for its launch by industry giants such as Binance and BitMEX. Meanwhile, CME Group said it intends to double its monthly Bitcoin futures trading cap to BTC 10,000, and that it has already asked CFTC for regulatory permission. Yesterday they announced that Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) in the first four trading days of the year is up 69% from year-end OI. Bitcoin futures open interest (OI) started the first four trading days with 5.4K contracts on January 7, up 69% from year-end OI. https://t.co/rkPfdlSyeB pic.twitter.com/Dnm1h4JrcuIn the meantime, Bitcoin is currently (14:40 UTC ) trading at USD 7,936. It's up 0.5% in the last 24 hours and appreciated 9% in a week."

","How close is bitcoin (BTC) to becoming money? New data from BitMEX Research claims that although BTC transactions are now more precise than ever, the cryptocurrency still remains a long way off elusive money status – and believe that precision could actually hurt BTC’s hopes of becoming money.","The big news is that there has been a “marked increase in [BTC] precision in the last 10 years, which surprisingly continued even beyond 2018.”The authors of the report, named Growth in the Level of Precision of Bitcoin Spending, and published on the BitMEX blog, write,“Currently over 70% of bitcoin outputs use the highest available degree of precision (one satoshi), considerable growth since the approx. 40% level in 2012.”However, the authors also note that most economists believe that for any commodity to be classified as money, it must meet three key criteria, in order.The BitMEX Research team outlines these as follows:The researchers say that “Bitcoin’s potential unique capability” in the area of “censorship-resistant electronic payments” could give it a key boost in the first step, its quest to become a medium of exchange.But the researchers say that the final stage is bitcoin’s “most ambitious and least likely step.” To attain unit of account status, mainstream businesses and governments would price goods and services in bitcoin, and bitcoin would become the currency most used in accounting documentation. And increased precision is actually detrimental to this final stage, per conventional academic thinking.The authors explain,“If unit of account status is achieved or becomes more prevalent, then presumably the degree of precision should reduce rather than increase. […] Bitcoin is moving in the opposite direction, the average degree of precision is still increasing. This may indicate a violation of the unit of account thesis, at least up until this point.”BitMEX Research identifies several factors that could be influencing the current increase in precision, namely:All this could spell bad news for bitcoin’s hopes of becoming money, with the elusive unit of account step, per BitMEX Research, “likely to be many years away, if it ever happens at all.” Instead, bitcoin remains firmly in “the medium of exchange” phase, where “the battle is still very much ongoing.”The authors’ conclude,“At least for now, [bitcoin’s] unit of account status is still somewhat of a fantasy.”___Learn more:

January 20, 2020
","Seven days after the launch of bitcoin options contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the latest trading volume figures still indicate that CME completely dominates over its competitor Bakkt.","According to trading data from CME, 122 bitcoin options contracts changed hands last Friday (January 17), when bitcoin (BTC) rallied. That marks more than a doubling from the 55 options contracts that were traded on the first day of trading on January 13.Each options contract at the CME represents a right, but not an obligation, to buy one bitcoin futures contract, which in turn represents 5 bitcoins. The latest volume figures from the CME show that contracts worth 610 BTC, or approximately USD 5.3 million, were traded on this market on Friday alone. In comparison, Bakkt reached a volume of USD 178,000 on the same day.CME’s domination in the institutional segment of bitcoin options market was also highlighted in the latest report from crypto research firm Arcane Research, which noted that “it seems that the institutional investors are preferring CME for now.”However, according to data from crypto analytics provider Skew, retail-focused exchanges such as Deribit and OKEx are still far ahead of their more institutionally-focused counterparts CME and Bakkt, with Deribit accounting for a large majority of the reported trading volume.Also, according to data from Skew, the total open interest in the bitcoin options market, meaning the number of options contracts that are traded either long or short, has risen sharply since the end of 2019. Once again, however, Deribit is accounting for a large majority of the open interest. Judging from the open interest figures, however, it should also be noted that the current level is still below levels from September to December last year. Consequently, there is a reason to ask whether the most recent rise is mostly a natural uptick from the slow activity that would be expected around the December holiday season."

February 04, 2020
","It appears that traditional financial advisors - ”who manage roughly half of all wealth in America” - are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about digital assets, such as Bitcoin (BTC).","In a piece published on accounting firm EisnerAmper LLP’s website by New York-based financial advisor Dara Albright, a number of developments were highlighted to show how traditional finance is in the process of merging with digital assets.“What about financial advisors and wealth managers,” Albright asked in the article while adding “are they ready to embrace digital assets and start recommending this novel asset class to their clientele?”She went on to answer her own question:“Based on the enthusiasm at last week’s National LINC 2020, TD Ameritrade's annual conference for financial advisors, I’d say that the answer is a resounding yes,” Albright said, listing key takeaways from the conference such as:(More than 1,800 registered investment advisors reportedly participated in the conference.)“Bitcoin is making saving and investing sexy again,” Albright quoted Sunayna Tuteja, Head of Digital Assets at major U.S. brokerage TD Ameritrade. (In January, regulated derivatives exchange ErisX, backed by TD Ameritrade, launched bitcoin futures for small investors).Also, according to the advisor, Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, reminded attendees of the event last week that “comfort is the enemy of profit, and that the greatest wealth is created when you believe in something before everyone else does.”However, Albright stressed that “the most persuasive argument in favor of digital assets” was made by Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines and of the RIA Digital Assets Council, who reportedly said: “The question you need to be asking yourself is not whether you think bitcoin is going higher, but rather do you think other people believe that it is.”Meanwhile, Edelman, at a separate major conference in January, Inside ETFs, made it clear that he believes financial advisors shouldn’t ignore bitcoin and blockchain technology.Financial advisors are often “fairly oblivious to blockchain” and “hesitant to invest client money in bitcoin,” but they shouldn’t be, Edelman was quoted as saying by ThinkAdvisor. He called open-source distributed ledgers “the most important innovation since the introduction of the magnetic strip.”“Bitcoin is worthy of consideration in your portfolios,” Edelman reportedly said, while suggesting financial advisors invest 1% to 2% of client funds in bitcoin, as long as the client understands the technology, plans to hold it for several years and can accept strong volatility and even a total loss.Meanwhile, a recent survey of financial advisors in the U.S. showed that “some legacy concerns about crypto” are “continuing to fade from view.” Only 6% of advisors believe that cryptocurrencies are a scam,” down from 11% last year. And 13% thought that “cryptocurrencies are in a bubble,” a drop from 2019’s figure of 19%. Moreover, the number of advisors allocating to crypto in client portfolios is expected to more than double in 2020, from 6% to 13%. Also, 76% of all surveyed financial advisors report receiving questions from clients on crypto in 2019."

(Per data from blockchain analytics provider Chainalysis, globally, over USD 600 million worth of bitcoin moved on darknet markets in Q4 of 2019.)The agency wrote that cryptocurrencies were being used as a form of payment for “illegal goods,” and announced,“We will promote initiatives that will strengthen our collaboration with service providers and e-commerce platforms.”And the AEAT added that it would begin to run training programs to help its staff fight cryptocurrency-powered crime – so they can monitor and flag suspicious-looking crypto transactions.The agency is set to cooperate with the nation’s Treasury Department, which last year stepped up its own crypto tax evasion-prevention by serving up some 1.5 thousand citizens with warnings about their taxable cryptocurrency earnings and trading profits.____

","In yet another example of perils that can await customers of traditional banks, and an argument in favor of decentralized cryptocurrencies, French banking giant Société Générale has reportedly decided to close the accounts of Julie Goislard, the owner of a library in Clichy-la-Garenne, in northern France, and those of two other members of her family after she criticized the bank.","Local daily Le Parisien reports that, in October 2019, Goislard tried calling the local branch of the bank 36 times after encountering problems with using the payment terminal installed at her library. According to the report, frustrated with the lack of response from Société Générale, she decided to contact the company’s customer service via her Twitter account. However, it wasn't the first time she expressed her frustration about the banking giant. More than a year ago, in October 2018, she tweeted:“The branch in Clichy, the ATM does not work, no envelopes to deposit cheques… A line that is growing longer,” Goislard wrote, accompanying the post with a photo taken inside the bank, showing the line ahead of her.

Meanwhile, on 12 December 2019, Goislard received a letter informing her that Société Générale decided to close her account within the next 60 days. “I received a phone call from the branch’s director, not to help me and find a solution to my problem, but to tell me to stop tweeting and threaten me with closing my account,” the librarian says. She was also invited to a six-minute meeting at the branch where, according to the librarian, its director “told us he could do whatever he wanted, even close all of our accounts” opened at the bank. Since that meeting, Goislard says she has received three more similar letters from the bank in a situation she describes as “totally delirious”. Société Générale has refused to comment on the matter to French journalists, pointing to “confidentiality and bank secrecy” and adding that the bank is not required to explain its decision. Julie Goislard tells her story:Meanwhile, it's not the first such case. As reported in November, the U.S.-headquartered banking giant Bank of America froze the accounts of ex PayPal Chief Financial Officer, prompting the Cryptosphere to share similar stories, but also a solution to the issue – Bitcoin."

January 07, 2020
","American regulators are unlikely to green-light Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-traded Funds) this year, but a China-based expert says that once approved, crypto ETFs will usher in a multitude of benefits to the industry. ","Matthew Graham, CEO of the China-based advisory company Sino Global Capital and General Partner at Liquid Value, spoke on the matter during an AMA (ask me anything) session hosted last week by TokenInsight, a token data and rating agency.Graham was discussing the fact that regulators have rejected Bitcoin ETF on multiple occasions in the past, and was commenting on the possibility of a crypto ETF gaining regulatory approval in 2020.Graham, who opined that crypto ETFs may finally see the light of day in 2021, stated,“From our perspective, we don’t think the applications will be able to meet the burden of proof in 2020.”He said that the slowdown could be due to the conservative nature of the institutions in the United States, regulatory bodies in particular, and the slow pace at which they operate. Crypto ETFs were a hot topic of discussion last year, with observers eagerly observing the deliberations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).If and when they do get the go-ahead, said Graham, an approval could lead to an influx of institutional capital.Other industry-wide effects could also follow.For instance, a crypto ETF approval would symbolize institutional acceptance. But while this could very likely set off a bull rally, per Graham, an ETF green light would not directly stimulate crypto demand. Instead, approval would likely represent a step in the long institutionalization process. As such, its benefits would be more indirect and “likely to be related to perception and a ‘halo effect’,” the CEO explained.Signs are relatively promising: as Graham pointed out, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has previously stated that “progress is being made” on the crypto ETF front.Graham went on to explain that the most important consideration for the SEC is the potential for market manipulation.Clayton has previously asked, “Given that they trade on largely unregulated exchanges how can we be sure that those prices aren’t subject to significant manipulation?”Graham also spoke about the possibility of entering “surveillance-sharing agreements,” whereby the SEC could monitor listing exchanges and the market, to see which entities are making trades. It could then also check on the size of trades, and investigate alleged instances of market manipulation.“Furthermore it’s notable that this isn’t an innocent-until-proven-guilty situation,” Graham added. “The burden of proof is on the applicant to satisfy any SEC concerns.”Applicants need to take into consideration the fact that SEC is a conservative institution, and “one that quite candidly has close ties to Wall Street and other entrenched interests that are quite wary of Bitcoin specifically and crypto in general.”As previously reported, a number of firms have unsuccessfully attempted to win SEC approval for crypto ETF products.According to a research paper released by Sino Global, the regulator’s reasons for refusal have included the following:The paper also lists three reasons for the possible future approval of a crypto ETF, pointing out key flaws in the SEC refusals, namely:Among the many companies who have applied are the likes of New York-based Wilshire Phoenix, which filed to launch the United States Bitcoin and Treasury Investment Trust ETF in May with NYSE Arca.Unlike other ETF applications, said Wilshire Phoenix, its ETF would seek to invest in both Bitcoin and United States Treasury securities (commonly referred to as T-bills). The product would also look to address the regular’s concerns on several levels, and make use of a surveillance sharing agreement. The SEC has postponed its ruling on this product and says it will either approve or reject it by February 26.Graham’s comments echo sentiments expressed by Gemini Trust co-founder Cameron Winklevos, who recently told the Financial Times,“ETFs, historically, have been a huge boon for industries like the gold market. It’s something that people understand: ETFs have been around for at least 25 years, so it’s not reinventing the wheel.”____Learn more: Why US BTC ETFs Matter if ‘No One Cares’ About European ETNs and ETPs"

However, investors do not seem worried - BTC rallied almost 20% in the past 24 hours.","At pixel time (10:31 UTC), BTG, ranked 35th by market capitalization, trades at c.

However, it is still unknown if the hackers managed to liquidate any of the coins at the exchange:“We do not know if they successfully extracted any value from an exchange,” the BGO added.The organization behind Bitcoin Gold also said that it believes “one or both attacks failed” due to risk control mechanisms in place at exchanges.In fact, this is not the first time a 51% attack is launched on bitcoin gold. It also happened back in May of 2018, and as evident from last week’s attack.Further, the team also defended itself by saying that they closely watch the market for hashing power:“We watch the blockchain and hashpower market closely. The evidence shows the hashpower for these attacks came through NiceHash,” the team said.We have been working on a novel 51%/Double-Spend resistant decentralized consensus algorithm since last year. We pl… https://t.co/TH3y9lzUoWNiceHash is an online marketplace for hashing power where people can buy a given amount of hashing power for a limited time, without having to invest in expensive hardware themselves. As such, it might be used as a tool for attackers who are plotting to launch 51% attacks, meaning they take control of at least 51% of the hashing power on a network.Although 51% attacks may be successful on smaller and more vulnerable cryptocurrencies, they are generally considered not to be economically feasible on larger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.According to Crypto51, a website that tracks the theoretical cost of launching 51% attacks, Bitcoin Gold is a vulnerable cryptocurrency in the sense that it is theoretically possible to buy almost all the required hashing power on services like NiceHash. Further, the cost of launching such an attack for 1 hour is estimated to be USD 765, compared with USD 675,000 in case someone would like to attack Bitcoin."

Additionally, even though we saw no other top 10 coins with a score above 4.9 seven days ago, all but Tether are in within the 5.1-5.7 range, and even USDT is close with a Sentscore of 4.9. Sentiment change among the top 10 coins*:
Interpreting the Sentscore’s scale:
- 0 to 2.5: very negative
- 2 to 3.9: somewhat negative zone
- 4 to 5.9: Neutral zone
- 6 to 7.49: somewhat positive zone
- 7.5 to 10: very positiveStill, winners and losers must be picked. Three winners this time are those with a rise of 20% and more, these being: Ethereum (ETH) with 24.6%, followed by Tron (TRX) with 24%, and Monero (XRM) with a 20% rise - a last week's winner and the one that pushed Stellar (XLM) to the last place. ETH's strongest aspect is fundamentals with a grade of 6.2, followed by 5.9 in news and 5.6 in technicals. Its weakest aspects are social with 4.8 and buzz with 3.8. On the other hand, Tron's highest scores are in news (7.2), technicals (6.5) and social (5.3), while its lowest are in fundamentals (4.2) and buzz (4). Finally, Monero has got 6.6 and 6.3 in technicals and news respectively, while it's got 4.6 in fundamentals and social each, and 4.3 in buzz.As no coins saw a drop, those with the smallest percentage to rise are this week's losers - and even they boast a high percentage. These are Tether with a rise of almost 8% and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) with 10.6%. Tether has a score of 6.2 in news, 5.4 in technicals and 5 in buzz, while also having 4.5 in social and 3.5 in fundamentals. On the other hand, BCH has high scores in technicals, news and social (6.9, 6.6 and 5.1, respectively), and lower scores in buzz and fundamentals (4.5 and 2.9, respectively).Daily Bitcoin Sentscore change in the past month:Meanwhile, for the last couple of weeks BTC has been consistently performing even better in the last 24 hour period. Its Sentscore in the last day has surpassed 7 and is now standing at 7.2, however with a change of -0.59%. Additionally, Tron has a Sentscore of 6.4 and ETH 6.2, but both have dropped 0.24% and 0.53%, respectively. The rest of the coins fall in the 5-5.7 range, except for USD with 4.4/10. As a matter of fact, all but EOS are in red. Looking at the 7-day average scores of the 28 coins outside the top 10 list tracked by Omenics, ten have scores 5 or above, while only Holo (HOT) is in the negative zone with a score of 3.8. ___* - Methodology:Omenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the Sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals based upon their proprietary algorithms.
As their website explains, “Omenics aggregates trending news articles and viral social media posts into an all-in-one data platform, where you can also analyze content sentiment,” later adding, “Omenics combines the 2 sentiment indicators from news and social media with 3 additional verticals for technical analysis, coin fundamentals, and buzz, resulting in the Sentscore which reports a general outlook for each coin.” For now, they are rating 38 cryptocurrencies."

January 15, 2020
","Only about 10 global cryptocurrency exchanges have any real impact on the price discovery in the bitcoin market, a new research study from crypto analytics firm Digital Asset Research suggests.","The study said that price moves that originate in one of these 10 exchanges later trickle over to other marketplaces, Bloomberg reported. This suggests that price discovery in the bitcoin market is still something that largely occurs on just a handful of centralized exchanges. However, the researchers did not include some large, reputable exchanges, such as Kraken (USD 365 million in trading volume in the past 24 hours), while adding smaller platforms, such as Gemini (USD 35 million). Top 10 exchanges by the number of times they were among first 5 to lead a price move:Source: Digital Asset Research, Bloomberg. Covers time period from April 1 to Dec. 31 of 2019In addition to the traditional crypto exchanges, however, some evidence in the study also suggests that derivatives markets – with BitMEX being the most notable – may have an impact on prices. However, the exact nature of this still needs further investigation, the researchers said.A lesson to be learned here for independent traders is that for the “most of the time, most of your attention” should be focused on the largest exchanges, Doug Schwenk, chairman of Digital Asset Research, told Bloomberg.In addition to confirming that price discovery largely occurs on the biggest exchanges, the results of the study should also serve to relieve concerns raised by government regulators that price manipulation and inflated trading volumes on smaller marketplaces have an impact on the bitcoin price.“Even though we know there’s fake volume in the market, that fake volume is not materially impacting the price,” Erin Friez, general counsel at the research firm, was quoted as saying in the same article.Among the regulatory agencies that have pointed to the risk of price manipulation in bitcoin as a reason for rejecting proposals for new bitcoin-related financial instruments, is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Specifically, this has been a recurring issue for companies seeking to launch the first bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S.According to a recent Twitter thread by Digital Asset Research, 24 ETF applications have been either rejected or withdrawn in the U.S. due to resistance from the SEC over the past seven years.“Each of these ETFs have taken a unique crack at satisfying the requirements demanded by the SEC. Thus far, none have managed to satisfy the regulator’s demands. However, from our reading of regulatory filings as well as public comments, we seem to be getting closer,” the firm wrote.The firm’s view that a bitcoin ETF seems to be getting closer thus aligns with the opinions of other experts, such as Matthew Graham, CEO of the China-based advisory company Sino Global Capital, who believes an ETF will be launched in 2021."

January 12, 2020
","Experts believe that bitcoin still has a long way to go before it gains mainstream global acceptance – but believe that the token could become a global mainstay, and even eclipse the dollar by 2030.","Industry insiders call the phenomenon “hyperbitcoinization” – the widespread, global adoption of Bitcoin that will see it eventually surpass conventional fiats like the dollar, the euro or the yen.But what do experts mean when they talk about hyperbitcoinization – and can industry players do anything to help speed it up?Hyperbitcoinization is not just a matter of bitcoin becoming more popular. It actually refers to a scenario whereby the token becomes the world’s most dominant currency.For that to occur, fiat currencies would need to devalue against digital alternatives, effectively pushing people to adopt and use Bitcoin instead.The theory goes that the world’s leading fiat currencies would suffer hyperinflation and subsequent demonetization.And if that were to happen, the mass adoption of bitcoin would provide the only viable alternative for individuals and companies the world over.In 2014, Daniel Krawisz, Director of Research at the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, explained the concept of hyperbitcoinization in a blog post. He wrote:“Hyperbitcoinization is a voluntary transition from an inferior currency to a superior one, and its adoption is a series of individual acts of entrepreneurship rather than a single monopolist that games the system.” It might sound like a utopian concept, but some companies are confident enough to start laying the groundwork for a hyperbitcoinized future.Neel Popat, CEO of Donut, an app that allows users to turn their spare change into bitcoin, told Cryptonews.com,“We continue to build more and more infrastructure to support hyperbitcoinization but still have some work to do to reduce the entry barriers for the average consumer. The last decade was about establishing bitcoin as a credible alternative to centralized currencies. The next decade will be about facilitating bitcoin’s mass adoption.”Others say that taking proactive measures could help speed up the process.John Carvalho, COO at BitRefill, a platform that allows customers to spend bitcoin on a range of products and services, told Cryptonews.com that he believes that the world will continue to support bitcoin more as a store of value and as money for payments.Carvalho opined,“It is undeniable that Bitcoin has made progress in the past 10 years, so it is mostly a question of how far it will go and how long it will take to get there. No one can predict the future, but we can all participate in accelerating its inevitability in various ways.”Others, however, urge caution.Alexander Leishman, the founder and CEO of crypto financial services company River Financial, noted,“I believe the store of wealth narrative will continue to materialize over the next 10 years, and it will be even longer before bitcoin is widely used as a currency for a non-negligible percentage of the world's economic transactions. However, it is important to remember that bitcoin is still an experiment and far from a sure thing. There is still a lot of work left for us to do if hyperbitcoinization is ever going to happen.”From an economic perspective, bitcoin will need to first become a “sound” currency if it is to succeed as a global token – and for hyperbitcoinization to finally kick in.But what exactly constitutes sound money?Economists are divided over the matter. The most widely accepted definition of sound money is a medium of exchange that is durable, divisible, portable, uniform, limited in supply, acceptable and fungible. Moreover, sound money should derive its value and stability from goods or commodities.Bitcoin actually ticks most of these boxes. It is undoubtedly portable, divisible, uniform, durable and limited in supply. It is also backed by a blockchain protocol that deploys a proof-of-work algorithm, ensuring the network’s integrity.But for bitcoin to truly become sound money, it will need to find two more pieces of the puzzle: acceptability and fungibility.On the acceptance front, it will need to become a universally accepted method of payment at retail outlets, businesses and even public sector institutions. For that to happen, Bitcoin needs to become a better payment network.Current Bitcoin network on-chain transaction fees are too high to process small payments, and confirmation times are still taking too long. Fortunately, thanks to the Lightning Network, these issues may soon become a thing of the past.While the Lightning Network is not without its critics, this second-layer blockchain solution has demonstrated that small payments can be successfully handled off-chain through so-called payment channels with only the starting and ending balances being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.The network has only been operating for a little under two years, and is still in its beta phase, but many enthusiasts are optimistic about its future. One day, perhaps, this scaling solution will allow millions or even billions of users to use bitcoin to buy coffee.Learn more: How Adoption Will Look in 2020 and BeyondFungibility is another conundrum. Many crypto enthusiasts are not aware of the fact that not all bitcoin tokens are equal. There are freshly mined “virgin” coins that have never been spent (which often sell at a premium), and considerably-less-attractive “tainted” coins that have been used by criminals and have been blacklisted by exchanges.And there are plenty that fall into neither category – tokens that are neither brand new nor tainted by criminal hands.One workaround could involve implementing privacy features into Bitcoin, making all coins fully fungible.Litecoin founder Charlie Lee agrees with this notion. In January 2019, he tweeted,“Fungibility is the only property of sound money that is missing from Bitcoin and Litecoin. Now that the scaling debate is behind us, the next battleground will be on fungibility and privacy.” While Bitcoin is not quite ready for the mainstream limelight just yet, the stage is certainly being set. With scaling and privacy solutions in development, hyperbitcoinization may actually become a reality someday. And the industry is nothing if not optimistic on the subject. As Leishman states,“I think hyperbitcoinization is certainly a possibility. I don’t foresee government currencies ever disappearing completely, but I do think there is a good chance that we will see a world where bitcoin is used very widely as a store of wealth and a transactional currency.”__Learn more: Now That Bitcoin 'is Digital Gold,' Which Crypto is For Payments?"

January 28, 2020
","The business and property division of the British High Court has instructed crypto exchange Bitfinex to freeze a bitcoin (BTC) account containing funds worth USD 860,000 after hearing that its owner may have links to a ransomware scam.","Per documentation released by the court, an unnamed “Canadian insurance company,” itself the client of an unnamed “English insurer,” was hit with a ransomware attack. Hackers, the court said, succeeded in installing the BitPaymer software on the Canadian company’s computers, and then encrypted the latter’s data.The attackers then sent emails to the victim, including the following:“Hello, to get your data back you have to pay for the decryption tool. The price is USD 1,200,000. You have to make the payment in bitcoin.”The Canadian company, acting with the British insurer, then paid USD 950,000 worth of Bitcoin to the attackers. However, the hackers appear to have converted only a tiny amount of that figure into fiat with the remainder left in what appears to be an account on the Bitfinex exchange.The British court has ordered Bitfinex to pass over its know-your-customer (KYC) information on the account owner.As media outlet New Money Review reports, the court’s decision could bring about a legal precedent. The fact that the court allowed its business and property division to tackle the case could possibly pave the way for UK courts to consider cryptocurrencies as property in subsequent cases.However, as reported in November 2019, UK Jurisdiction Taskforce confirmed that cryptoassets ""to be treated in principle to be property, bringing the legal treatment of tokens into line with public perception."" The court confirmed that the suspicious transaction was flagged using tools created by American blockchain investigator Chainalysis. The court stated that Bitfinex had indicated that “it is their practice to comply with the court order for any national jurisdiction.”New Money Review quotes Bitfinex as stating,“We have assisted the claimant to trace the stolen bitcoin and we understand the focus of the claimant’s attention is no longer on the Bitfinex platform. It now appears Bitfinex is an entirely innocent party mixed up in this wrongdoing.”Meanwhile, as reported in November 2019, a ransomware outbreak hit a Wisconsin-based IT company Virtual Care Provider Inc. , which provides cloud data hosting, security and access management to more than 100 nursing homes across the United States. Unknown attackers encrypted all data the company hosts and demanded a USD 14 million ransom in bitcoin in exchange for a digital key needed to access the files."

January 23, 2020
","As a group of mining pools announced their infrastructure funding plan for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), the crypto industry players are discussing if this is a dictatorial move, if it's a soft work, and to how many more forks it may lead. ","Jiang Zhuoer, CEO of one of the largest mining pools on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), BTC.TOP, published an intention to direct 12.5% of BCH coinbase rewards to a fund that will support Bitcoin Cash infrastructure. This is a ""6-month short-term donation plan,"" (May 15-November 15), Zhuoer says, which would redirect BCH 20,588 (USD 7 million) towards BCH ecosystem development. Besides BTC.TOP, the proposal is supported by other large mining pools: Antpool, ViaBTC, BTC.com, and Bitcoin.com, and it's signed by Zhuoer, Jihan Wu (CEO of Bitmain), Haipo Yang, and prominent Bitcoin Cash supporter Roger Ver.As for the reasons behind this move, the group names the lack of funds for full node implementation and for critical infrastructure development, leaving it open to damages and sabotages. They say that the goal is to gather enough funds for this so that BCH developers can hasten its development before what they believe will be a bull market in 2020-2021/22. A Hong Kong corporation has been set up to legally accept and disperse funds, the post says, though it's not clear which corporation or what their process for dispersing funds is.The initiative announced as Bitcoin Cash is approaching its next mining reward halving, estimated in May this year. Then, the BCH block reward will drop from BCH 12.5 to BCH 6.25. Meanwhile, in June 2019, some members of the Cryptoland started to speculate that Bitcoin Cash is ""on the brink of the collapse and developer coup is under way."" However, back then, Roger Ver replied that it's ""fake news.""Now, the new 'coalition' claims that this is not a protocol change and that the initiative is under the miners' control and direction, but it added this as well: ""To ensure participation and include subsidization from the whole pool of SHA-256 mining, miners will orphan BCH blocks that do not follow the plan. This is needed to avoid a tragedy of the commons.""In this case, ""orphan blocks"", or stale blocks, would no longer be included in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, leaving a miner without the reward.And while many in the BCH community see this as a ""noble cause,"" it did not sit well with the many in the Cryptoverse. So if I'm reading this right, 5 mining pools with 35% of the BCH hashpower are threatening to orphan blocks from the other 65% of miners if they don't agree to a 12.5% tax to fund developers? pic.twitter.com/eNQfrsAyGcEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin commented that ""BCH is soft-forking in a Zcash-style in-protocol developer fund."" 
(Last year, Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Electric Coin Company, the firm behind the privacy-focused Zcash, suggested to create a ""Dev Fund"" and allocate coins from future block rewards for core support functions such as software development.)Though presented as voluntary, says Buterin, it's a compulsory soft fork, the irony being, he notes, that BCH as a chain born ""as a reaction to an ideology that claims that soft forks are the only legitimate way to make changes because they are ""voluntary"" is.... making a controversial soft fork and insinuating that it's voluntary."" This is, however, a natural extension of BCH's ideology, called 'the market of consensus,' he adds.That said, the thing that I highly applaud is cypherpunks taking public goods challenges seriously. I've been increasingly harping on this topic, as have others:https://t.co/uV5JmbbYHhLitecoin  founder Charlie Lee finds that this centralized feature added in coercive manner sets a bad precedent. Furthermore, as ""this mining cartel currently owns only ~28% of the BCH hashrate,"" says Lee, ""they can't enforce this coercive soft fork unless they come up with a lot more hashrate. And it would likely lead to many forks."" Popular crypto researcher Hasu noted that BCH pools observe this as an investment and that users are not impacted by this, but BTC miners are. So if SHA256 miners disagree that this move maximizes the SHA256 pie, they could, in turn, allocate their hashpower to BCH and orphan all blocks by the cartel.The mining market can absolutely resolve this situation on its own!Others, like Angela Walch, research fellow at UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies, wonder what happened with ""censorship resistance and miners being purely ministerial and not exercising discretion over what transactions they process,"" and if they should rethink the established conclusions about miners.Meanwhile, BCH is currently (9:35 USD) trading at USD 337. It's down 2.9% in a day, and it's up 6.4% in a week.Here are a few more comments:$BCH implementing a 12.5% miner's tax is hilarious and anyone not donating will have their blocks orphaned.Literally a centralized totalitarian regime with a 51% attack threat.""A Hong Kong corporation has been set up to legally accept and disperse funds""https://t.co/UsDIv2yEl4__This is a bit like Burger King saying they plan to close 12.5% of their stores, yet McDonald's workers will bear most of the costs, since wages will be driven downThis is true from a certain perspective, but the key point is fewer Burger King storeshttps://t.co/T11g4RCBLT pic.twitter.com/6DoPgj0Dt7__Given that, unlike restaurant staff, miners will rebalance immediately, I think the analogy works fine. There will indeed be fewer rewards for the same number of miners.Some miners will become unprofitable and drop off, but those who are still cashflow-profitable will carry on.__Does anyone else feel like they really buried the lede here? I would think a more appropriate headline would be ""BCH Schedules Bull Market for 2020–2021/22"" pic.twitter.com/GQEM2YeeAO"

A successful close above the USD 8,350 resistance could open the doors for more gains above the USD 8,500 and USD 8,700 resistance levels.
On the downside, the main weekly support is near USD 7,850, below which the price may perhaps move into a bearish zone. The next major support is near the USD 7,550 and USD 7,350 levels.Ethereum price  seems to be trading in a broad range above the weekly support at USD 140. On the upside, an initial resistance is near the USD 145 level. However, the main hurdle for the bulls is near USD 148, above which the price is likely to rally towards USD 160.
On the downside, a close below the USD 140 level might start a fresh decline. In the mentioned case, the price is likely to revisit the USD 130 zone.Bitcoin cash price  performed well and traded above the USD 250 resistance level. BCH/USD tested the USD 275 resistance and it is currently consolidating above the USD 260 level. If there is a downside correction, the price might test the USD 250 level before a fresh upward move in the near term.
Litecoin  made good progress and climbed above the USD 48.50 resistance level. LTC/USD even climbed above the USD 50.00 resistance. On the upside, the price seems to be struggling just below USD 52.00. A clear break above USD 52.00 could set the pace for a push towards the USD 55.00 level.
XRP price  finally settled above the USD 0.200 and USD 0.210 resistance levels. XRP/USD tested the USD 0.225 resistance and it is currently correcting lower.

A clear break above USD 8,720 and a follow through above USD 8,850 are needed for a fresh increase. The main weekly resistance for the bulls is near the USD 9,200 area.

XRP price  topped near the USD 0.255 level and recently declined heavily along with bitcoin. XRP/USD broke the USD 0.240 support and even spiked below the USD 0.230 level. It tested the USD 0.228 support and currently consolidating losses. On the upside, the price must settle above the USD 0.240 level to start a strong rise towards USD 0.255 and USD 0.260.In the past three sessions, a few smaller altcoins trimmed gains more than 5%, including CKB, STEEM, BCD, ETC, BTM, IOST, BTS, HC, SNT and TRX. Out of these, CKB is down around 15% and STEEM declined nearly 14%.Overall, bitcoin price is still trading above the key USD 8,550 and USD 8,050 support levels.

A clear break above USD 146 may perhaps lead the price towards USD 152.Bitcoin cash price  rallied further above the USD 230 and USD 235 resistance levels. BCH/USD is now trading above USD 240 and it might soon make an attempt to climb above the main USD 250 resistance area. On the downside, supports are USD 235 and USD 230.
Litecoin  popped above the USD 45.00 resistance level to move into a positive zone. LTC/USD is currently correcting gains, but it is likely to find support near the USD 44.20 and USD 43.50 levels. On the upside, the next hurdle for the bulls is near the USD 46.50 level.
XRP price  outperformed most major altcoins and bitcoin to climb more than 12%. XRP/USD broke the key USD 0.200 resistance and rallied above USD 0.212 and USD 0.220. However, it faced sellers near USD 0.225 and it is currently correcting gains.In the past three sessions, many small capitalization altcoins gained more than 5%, including CENNZ, DGD, REN, BTS, HC, OKB, ADA, BTG, CRO, LINK, OMG and SNT. Out of these, CENNZ is up around 24% and DGD rallied close to 11%. Overall, bitcoin price is showing a lot of positive signs above the USD 7,650 and USD 7,800 levels. As long as it stays above USD 7,650, there are high chances of more upsides above the USD 8,000 and USD 8,050 resistance levels."

","A bitcoin-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) may not come as soon as many crypto fans hope, at least if we are to believe the CEO of one of the largest ETF providers in the U.S., VanEck Associates.","“I agree with some commentators, I don’t see a bitcoin ETF being approved any time soon,” Jan van Eck, CEO of VanEck Associates, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.In the wide-ranging interview that touched on many different aspects of the company’s ETF business, van Eck also said that he believes financial institutions will be able to get the exposure to bitcoin they are seeking, although he expressed doubt as to whether that would be a good idea for retail investors, or the general public.“Yes, vehicles that allow QIBs [qualified institutional buyers] or accredited investors to access it, that’s fine. But still [with an ETF], you’d have tens of millions of retail Americans invested with no regulatory protection…,” the CEO said.In the past, much hope and optimism has been associated with the VanEck brand in the crypto community, as many believed it would become the first ETF provider to launch an ETF backed by physical bitcoins in the U.S. However, progress on that front has been slow, and companies have struggled to meet the demands of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Despite a bitcoin ETF approval still remaining just a dream for many bitcoin holders, others argue that an ETF is becoming increasingly irrelevant, as “we’re increasingly seeing that retail brokerages are going to offer bitcoin to their clients.” Also, some experts warned that an approved ETF “might cause more problems than it’s worth.”Meanwhile, a new survey by fund operator Bitwise that is unsuccessfully trying to launch its own bitcoin ETF, has found that financial advisors in the U.S. would be keen to put their clients' money into crypto ETFs – hinting that should bitcoin ETFs become easily available, widespread BTC adoption could follow.

","Criminals made some USD 2.8 billion worth of illegal transactions using bitcoin (BTC) on cryptocurrency exchanges last year, alleges a new report – with Binance and Huobi overwhelmingly their platforms of choice thanks to corrupt OTC brokers.","The report was compiled by blockchain analytics provider Chainalysis, which said that “illicit cryptocurrency” transactions at exchanges have “taken in a steadily growing share since the beginning of 2019.” The analytics firm stated that “criminal entities” were increasingly looking to move their funds onto exchanges, with 27.5% of such transactions made on Binance platforms, 24.7% taking place on Huobi and other platforms accounting for the remaining 47.8%.What is more, a small group of account holders appear to be responsible for most of the illicit activities on both platforms.The Chainalysis report authors wrote,“Just over 300,000 individual accounts at Binance and Huobi received bitcoin from criminal sources.”And it seems criminals prefer to make use of over-the-counter (OTC) services. The report’s authors say they have created a sample group of “100 major OTC brokers” it believes “provide money laundering services, based on the fact that they’ve received large amounts of cryptocurrency from illicit sources.”In the sample group, 70 are Huobi account holders that have allegedly received Bitcoin from illicit sources. And 20 of these accounts received USD 1 million or more worth of illegally acquired Bitcoin in the same time period.The report alleges that OTC desks have little in the way of compliance requirements and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) protocols, a factor that has led criminals to favor OTC transactions.""If there were no way for bad actors to cash out cryptocurrency they’ve received through illegal means, there’d be far less incentive for them to commit crimes in the first place. That would mean not only fewer victims affected by crimes, but would also help improve cryptocurrency’s reputation as the industry seeks to work with regulators and traditional financial institutions and drive increased adoption,"" Chainalysis stressed and urged exchanges to carry out more extensive due diligence on OTC brokers and other nested services operating on their platform.""As global capital flows into crypto, we are aware of the growing trend and movements of illicit funds, and we are working with like-minded partners such as Chainalysis to improve on existing systems and address these concerns,"" reacted Samuel Lim, Chief Compliance Officer of Binance. Meanwhile, in December, Chainalysis said that at least BTC 20,000 and ETH 790,000 are still waiting to be dumped on the market by the criminals from the ""one of the largest Ponzi schemes ever,"" PlusToken, while the thieves have already cashed out c.

The company has some USD 56.5 million worth of net assets, but is hoping to double that amount by the midway point of this year.A number of rival crypto competitors have already made significant banking moves. In August 2019, Swiss financial regulator FINMA awarded banking licenses to two crypto-related businesses: Seba Crypto and Sygnum.However, it may not all be plain sailing for companies like Bitcoin Suisse. Per a 2018 FINMA memo obtained by Swissinfo, the regulator believes that financial services companies should risk-weight cryptocurrencies at eight times their value, citing market volatility as its reasoning.Bitcoin Suisse was set up in 2013, and claims it is the oldest and largest crypto financial services company in the Swiss market.

","As nearly all coins in the crypto market surge, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency dash (DASH) stands out as one of the biggest winners, recording a gain of about 70% over the past two days alone. ","In fact, large gains in the price of dash started to occur already in early January when the price bottomed out at about USD 40. Since then, the market has seen a total price increase of nearly 200% to almost USD 120 as of pixel time (14:42 UTC). The price is also up by almost 40% in the past 24 hours.DASH price chart:In the community, many speculate if it is demand in Venezuela that is driving the price higher.

On the other hand, Bitcoin (BTC), while having by far the highest Sentscore of 7.2 (up from 6.8 a week ago), is no longer the only coin in the positive zone. It's joined by, not one, but three other tokens, making it four coins in the positive zone, which is a rare occurrence. It's far more common to see only one other coin alongside BTC with a score of 6 and up. The three coins are: Ethereum (ETH), EOS (EOS), and Cardano (ADA).  Speaking of Cardano, it and Stellar (XLM) have pushed out Tron (TRX) and Monero (XMR) from the top 10 list, taking their 10th and 9th positions, respectively.Sentiment change among the top 10 coins*:
Interpreting the Sentscore’s scale:
- 0 to 2.5: very negative
- 2 to 3.9: somewhat negative zone
- 4 to 5.9: Neutral zone
- 6 to 7.49: somewhat positive zone
- 7.5 to 10: very positiveLooking at the coins with the highest rise in their scores, we find EOS with 14.8%, Stellar with 12.8%, and Ethereum with 12.6%. EOS's strongest aspect this week is news with a high score of 8, followed by technicals at 7.3. It's social has got 4.6, fundamentals 4.2, and buzz 3.7. Similarly, Stellar has 7.9 in news and 6.1 in technicals, as well as 4.9 in socials, 3.9 in fundamentals and 3.8 in buzz. Lastly, Ethereum got a score of 6.7 in news and technicals each, 6.2 in fundamentals, 4.8 in social and 4 in buzz.Tether is yet again the loosing coin, for the third week in a row. As a matter of fact, while it wasn't at the bottom four weeks ago, it had founded itself there for three weeks in a row before that as well. It's highest score is in news with 6.4, while it got 5 in buzz, followed by 4.9 in social, 4.1 in technicals, and 3,7 in fundamentals as its lowest score.Meanwhile, this time around, BTC's 24-hour Sentscore is not higher than its 7-day one. It's now 6.7, with a change of -2.6%. Besides it, three coins are again in the positive zone, but instead of EOS, Cardano made that list. Half are in red and half in green today, which may be an indicator of a weaker performance until next Monday.Daily Bitcoin Sentscore change in the past month:Now observing the 7-day average scores of the 29 other coins tracked by Omenics, we see an interesting development. It's not often that we can report coins in the positive zone outside the top 10, and now we have tree of them: Monero (6), Dash (6.1), and Tron (6.2). Furthermore, 19 have scores 5 or above (compared to last week's 4), and there isn't a single coin in the negative zone.___* - Methodology:Omenics measures the market sentiment by calculating the Sentscore, which aggregates the sentiment from news, social media, technical analysis, viral trends, and coin fundamentals based upon their proprietary algorithms.

",The prominent Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz admitted to his followers on Twitter that he struggles to understand the recent altcoin rally.,"“I’m not sure I understand the altcoin rally. Happy for those making money on it. But not sure what changed. Maybe new year, new money, new enthusiasm. Dinner in NYC for best explanation,” Novogratz tweeted earlier this week.As would be expected when one of the wealthiest investors in the crypto space offers a dinner, people are eager to help out, offering a variety of explanations for the rally.Among the explanations offered, some questioned whether an altcoin rally is really taking place, saying “it’s just a bull trap for the morons.” However, the ex-investment banker also received more serious explanations, such as this one from Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard book:“Altcoins have approximately zero liquidity, so when bitcoin starts to rise, it only takes a little bit of money seeking ""diversification"" to make altcoins rally. As alt liquidity rises & their numbers swell, the effect dissipates.”Others argued that the market over the past few days have been mostly driven by the action in Bitcoin SV (BSV) and the drama surrounding Craig Wright:“There is no altcoin rally. It’s Bitcoin (BSV) leading with altcoins lagging behind,” said one user. Other users, however, had the opposite take, likening the BSV rally to a classic pump-and-dump scheme, saying “They are more or less pump and dump schemes. The most obvious example of this is BSV.”The popular crypto analyst Mati Greenspan from Quantum Economics also joined the discussion, saying that Tuesday alone saw an increase in the total value locked in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts by 16%, to a total of nearly USD 800 million. “It seems that during yesterday's little bout of crypto volatility there was a significant increase in the amount of money being deployed in this new area of the market. Presumably, traders were using this new option to increase their capital in order to take advantage of the huge moves in the market,” Greenspan noted.Bitcoin dominance, or the percentage of the total market capitalization, dropped by 2 percentage points, to less than 66% in the past week.Following the original post from Novogratz, a new tweet was published on Wednesday, asking if Justin Sun’s investment in the Poloniex exchange could have something to do with the rally. However, the community appears largely skeptical.“No. He’s a hype man going low brow with a low volume exchange he bought and turned into just another TRX hype tool. Little to nothing to do with recent alt moves,” said one user.“Doubt any one piece of news, single exchange, or single alt can pull up the entire market. It is mostly macro supply and demand and highly correlated (to each other and to BTC),” another Twitter user suggested.Meanwhile, bitcoin and majority of altcoins are in red today.

","Disclaimer: The text below is a sponsored article that was not written by Cryptonews.com journalists.
","Cryptocurrencies have been all over the news lately. This is largely due to their wild price fluctuations. However, what seems to be forgotten amongst all the talk of all-time highs and 60% corrections is that you can actually use them to buy things with. You know, like a currency? Every year the list of retailers prepared to accept payment in some form of cryptocurrency is expanding too.Today, you can most things using digital currency. Some stores exclusively accept Bitcoin, others favour quicker solutions with lower fees. However, with recent upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol such as Segwit and the forthcoming Lightning Network, the fees and transaction times of the original cryptocurrency should come in line with some of the more modern offerings in the space. Offerings that don't quite have the same historical pedigree or immaculate conception of Bitcoin.Ultimately, the best cryptocurrency to buy something with is going to depend on both the buyer and seller. Which digital currency will the vendor accept? Which crypto does the buyer want to exchange for the goods and services offered. Then come additional factors such as privacy, transaction cost, and time.Small PurchasesCertain cryptocurrencies lend themselves well to smaller purchases. The likes of Litecoin and Dash can process many more transactions per second than Bitcoin can manage. Thus, the fees required for the network participants to acknowledge and validate a transaction on these blockchains are much lower. It can cost less than a cent to make transactions using these blockchains, however, their security is neither as battle tested, or robust as Bitcoin's. It might make sense to pay for a $10 gift card from eGifter with LTC or DASH but for a much larger purchase, waiting a little longer for that additional security isn't too big of a deal.Some websites, like Overstock.com have been particularly progressive when it comes to cryptocurrency payments. They were some of the first to accept payments in digital currency for their products. They sell mostly homeware and began accepting Bitcoin back in January 2014. They later expanded to include Ether, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, and Bitcoin Cash as payment options.Real EstateThere have been several examples of people selling real estate for cryptocurrency across the globe. They've mostly been handled using the original blockchain-based digital currency, Bitcoin. Whether it was the modest Grimsby terraced property, or the Moscow mega-mansion, the owners of these homes would happily be compensated in cryptocurrency rather than their national currencies.Then there was the example co-founder of TechCrunch, Michael Arrington. He bought a house without legal arbitration using the Ethereum blockchain. This is surely a taste of how such transactions will occur in the future sans expensive middlemen. The payment was also made using Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether.Illegal GoodsSome cryptocurrencies have been developed to be completely anonymous. Bitcoin used to be touted as such but in reality, thanks to the numerous official on and off ramps, it's incredibly easy to see a single Bitcoin's route around the network. It's possible with a little detective work to pinpoint identities to wallets and as such, for illegal purposes, other coins are now favoured. Of these, the current darknet favourite is known as Monero. By omitting certain data from transactions, it's impossible to see where funds have been sent using Monero. This has made it not only well-suited to darknet drug dealing but also as a means for circumventing international sanctions imposed on rogue States such as North Korea.GamblingAny number of cryptocurrencies are now being accepted at the various cryptocurrency casinos across the internet. These include Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, DOGE and others. The length of time you're prepared to wait for a transaction to confirm will be the main determining factor on which you choose to use. It's worth noting that many of the welcome bonuses at cryptocurrency casinos seem to favour Bitcoin. If you work out how big each bonus is in a common currency, you'll find sometimes large disparities between the amounts. You can take a look at plenty of cryptocurrency casino reviews over at NoDeposit365.Those living in oppressive States where online gambling is illegal, could use a privacy-focused coin like Monero to circumvent the legislation of their country. Using a VPN or encrypted browser, and an untraceable currency could allow those restricted from playing games of chance online to partake in the pastime.TravelYou can use cryptocurrency to pay for some aspects of travel too. The giants that are Expedia began accepting Bitcoin for hotel bookings back in 2014. They've yet to expand the initiative to other services they provide but being trendsetters in this regard, it will probably not be long before they start accepting other large cryptocurrencies too. Another option to book a hotel room using Bitcoin is to use Hotels.com in combination with Gyft.com. They work like eGifter and can be used at around 150,000 hotels on the travel website.There are a few airlines that accept cryptocurrency payments too. Destinia.com, CheapAir.com, and AirBaltic are amongst the largest of them.These are just are few of the many options available for people looking to actually spend their cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the best cryptocurrency to make a purchase with is going to depend on a myriad of factors. It's no good arguing that Litecoin or Dash are superior to Bitcoin for commerce if you can't find of a seller of the required item that accepts either of those currencies. Likewise, Monero might be well-suited to illegal purposes but would you bother trading Bitcoin you had sitting in a wallet to a privacy-focused coin if you just wanted to buy an eGifter voucher for a friend's birthday?As the cryptocurrency space becomes more developed, it's likely that a firm favourite will emerge from the often-confusing selection of digital coins we have at present. Or, perhaps a new currency will emerge as the most practical for commercial purposes, rendering many of the digital currencies we have today useless. Only time and the market will tell in this rapidly expanding financial technology sector."

","New institutional investors flocking into Bitcoin helped major digital asset manager Grayscale Investments to raise over USD 600 million in 2019, or more than in 2013-2018 combined. ","Cumulative investment across the Grayscale family of products surpassed USD 1 billion for the first time, the company said in their 2019 Digital Asset Investment Report.  The report reveals that Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust brought in Q4 investments of USD 193.8 million—the single largest capital raise since the firm’s inception in 2013. In the same quarter, investments in non-Bitcoin related products dropped to USD 31.7 million. In total, the company raised USD 225.5 million in Q4, or 12% less than in Q3.  However, the firm claims it saw substantial growth in new clientele, with a 24% increase in client base. Further, diversification within the platform also led to growth, with 36% of all clients now using more than one product. The new client totals were largely due to institutional investments, with 71% of all new assets in 2019 flowing from this source, hedge funds mostly. Also, the firm saw a substantial bump in high net worth investors in the fourth quarter, representing 41% of all investments during the time. __Last year, Grayscale has intentionally made investing in cryptocurrencies more simple for legacy-style investors: “We have removed the barrier to entry so that institutions and individual investors can benefit from exposure to digital currencies.”Notably, investors in the Grayscale products do not actually hold the coins. Instead, Grayscale remains in possession of the coins, but offers shares in the investment, providing both exposure and risk protection. This feature has apparently proven highly valuable for risk-averse investors. Nevertheless, returns for the year reflected the overall market movement. The Bitcoin Investment Trust returned investors 87.7%, largely due to value increases in the asset. However, investors lost over 60% on the Stellar Lumens fund, and nearly 50% in the XRP fund."

","Bull market, bear market, or maybe altseason? Opinions are divided among crypto industry insiders on where exactly we are in the cycle, with some seeing a surge in prices ahead, and others remaining skeptical on whether the current rally is sustainable.","The sense of confusion and mixed market sentiment also echoed by crypto trading venue SFOX, whose research team noted that “the SFOX Multi-Factor Market Index remains at neutral” in their latest crypto market report:“Based on our calculations and analyses, the SFOX Multi-Factor Market Index, which was set at neutral a month ago, remains at neutral as of February 4th — though, within the confines of that rating, it has moved away from the bullish direction of the index (+1) towards the bearish direction of the index (-1),” the report said.According to SFOX, the index is calculated by analyzing the four factors “price momentum, market sentiment, volatility, and continued advancement of the sector.”However, the company stressed that while prices appear to be increasing and substantial growth is happening in terms of institutional product offerings and regulatory clarity, there are still significant unknowns hovering over the market at large:Despite SFOX sticking to its “neutral” outlook, however, Mati Greenspan, Founder of Quantum Economics, appears more optimistic, responding to a tweet about the recent XRP rally that “It’s altseason.”“One of the defining attributes of altseason are the random pumps on various coins, whether deserved or not. Dash, Zcash, BSV, Tezos and several others have been tracking some serious gains lately,” he added in his newsletter today.According to him, it does seem that now, just as in the traditional markets with Tesla and the Nasdaq, investors are embracing risk. “We can see it as well in the BTC Dominance Index, which has been declining steadily since the start of the year,” Greenspan said. Bitcoin dominance, or the percentage of the total market capitalization, decreased by more than 3 percentage points, to 63.9% this year.Meanwhile, Terry Duffy, CEO of major derivatives marketplace CME Group, said in an interview with CNBC on Monday that “people are using bitcoin a lot like they’re using gold,” and that the company is starting to see “a little bit of interest” in their new bitcoin options market, which launched on January 13.As previously reported, the interest in bitcoin options on CME far surpassed Bakkt, another derivative market that primarily targets institutional traders. According to data from crypto analytics firm Skew, however, little seems to have changed to the better for Bakkt, which recently recorded 17 straight days without a single bitcoin options trade:Meanwhile, CME has seen trading volumes of USD 1 to 2 million per day for their institutionally focused bitcoin options:However, both venues are still minuscule compared to the massive volumes posted by the more retail-focused exchanges Deribit and OKEx, which suggests that the recent bitcoin rally has been largely retail-driven:“Wall Street has been rather apathetic to this recent surge, but they haven't been entirely silent. Volumes on the CME Group's cash-settled futures contracts have certainly been elevated. With that, the main volumes do seem to be coming from crypto exchanges at the moment,” Greenspan told Longhash.As reported back in January, however, many analysts are optimistic after the bitcoin price broke through its 200-day moving average, a key barrier for technical analysts.

",Do you think you’ve mastered the basics of Bitcoin and altcoin trading? Perhaps you think you’re ready to move on from casual trading and want to take the next step – but are put off by grizzled veterans using terminology you don’t understand.,"If that’s the case, Cryptonews.com has good news for you. We’ve prepared a foolproof guide to five terms you’ll hear some of the crypto world’s most prolific traders using.Applied knowledge is power, and learning about these terms can help you learn more about how the market works – and how to make it work for you.So here’s your chance: Learn how to sound like a crypto pro! And you never know…you might learn a thing or two about how to trade like one, too!A buy wall refers to when a whale or a group of affluent traders places large buy orders of a certain price in an exchange order book.Why would anyone want to place orders like these? Well, doing so could lead other market participants to believe a strong buying demand exists for a specific crypto trading pair.Big-money traders make buy and sell wall movements to influence the price of trading pairs. It effectively forces traders who want to buy to place orders that are slightly above the buy wall price – so that they can get their orders filled.The upshot of all this, in theory, is that the price of the asset tends to remain above the buy wall.Typically, buy walls only tend to remain on order books for a relatively short period of time – until they are either filled or the trader pulls their order. At that point, prices can drop significantly as orders below the buy wall level are filled.Essentially, it’s a form of market manipulation, and it’s something that many exchanges are now actively trying to clamp down on. As a trader, it is important to keep an eye on buy or sell walls to make sure you don’t get caught on the wrong side of the trade if key orders get pulled…and those walls come tumbling down.Futures contracts usually have a maturity of one, three or six months, depending on their contract specifications. In the case of Bitcoin futures, there is a wider range of options available, ranging from Bakkt’s one-day Bitcoin futures offerings to multi-month contracts on CME.No matter what the contract, however, all futures offerings have one thing in common: They expire.Futures are essentially agreements between two parties who agree to exchange cash for a specific amount of an underlying asset. Futures contracts exist on stocks, indices, currencies, commodities and more recently Bitcoin.The term futures expiration refers to the dates when contracts expire – the time when a buyer and seller exchange cash.In the days leading up to the expiration date, there is often an uptick in volumes as traders switch from expiring futures contracts to new contracts in order to maintain their futures positions.Moreover, futures expirations can impact the price of an asset because long or short positions need to be filled via the underlying asset.As a result, you might notice that the price of underlying assets – such as Bitcoin –experiences substantial volatility in the lead-up to key futures expiration days. Traders who want to stay ahead of the curve know that staying abreast of forthcoming crypto futures expiration dates is essential.Future gaps are price jumps that often occur while stock markets are closed for the weekend. On futures price charts, these price jumps often look like gaps – hence the name.And these gaps occur due to an imbalance between supply and demand. They are usually filled quickly as orders are filled.Futures gaps also occur in the world of Bitcoin and can be witnessed quite regularly.Quick-thinking traders can take advantage by keeping an eye out for potential futures gaps. After all, if you play your cards right, they can be an opportunity to make a trading profit if you place a trade to fill the gap.And as the BTC/USD pair spot trades 24/7 while Bitcoin futures do not, you might be surprised at how many future gap-filling opportunities do occur.This term refers to the phenomenon whereby an exchange closes out a trader’s derivatives position because the price of an asset has moved against the trader’s position to such an extent that the initial margin no longer covers the position.If that happens, the trader will not able to meet the margin call. In cases like these, a trader can lose every bit of capital they put up for the margin trade.As such, liquidations of large derivatives positions on Bitcoin, for example, can lead to price collapses or jumps.According to research conducted by investment data provider CryptoQuant, this is exactly what happened in late September 2019, when Bitcoin prices dropped sharply. The drop, say experts, was caused in part by around USD 700 million worth of liquidations on the BitMEX exchange.That is why it helps if you know who’s liquidating what and when. And if you notice trustworthy traders talking about recent or forthcoming liquidations, you’ll know it is time to get ready to take action. This term refers to the number of long positions that have been put on versus the number of short positions placed. It is a metric that basically allows you to gauge market sentiment. That means it can provide vital insight as to which way traders generally believe that the next price movement is going. Of course, in trading, there is absolutely no guarantee that the majority opinion will be right.But if you happen to believe in the “wisdom of the crowd,” you will certainly want to keep your eyes peeled for any significant long-short ratio movements."

","Significant financial bets in the form of ethereum (ETH) call options have been seemingly placed by a trader or group of traders who are going in big in the hopes that ETH will exceed USD 600 before the end of March, just two months from now.","As of pixel time (12:21 PM UTC), ETH is trading at about USD 176, up 2.6% in a day and 4.7% over the past 7 days. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, is up 7% over the past 7 days, and is up by 2.7% in the past 24 hours.The massive trades were first highlighted by CEO of Three Arrows Capital Su Zhu, who on Twitter shared a screenshot which highlighted ethereum options contracts for nearly ETH 9,000 (USD 1.57 million) expiring in March on Deribit Exchange.Decent volume today on @DeribitExchange today on $ETH deep out-of-the-money March2020 calls, 520 and 600 strike, ar… https://t.co/wxLhydEunsThe options contracts highlighted in the screenshot have strike (also known as exercise) prices of USD 520 and USD 600, respectively, meaning that the traders who hold the contracts will only make a profit if the price of ETH exceeds those levels by the date specified.The large bets suggest that there is currently big money anticipating significantly higher ETH prices in the coming months. This is perhaps surprising given the fact that ETH has lagged somewhat behind BTC in recent days, but may also indicate that traders currently see more potential for ETH going forward.For the price to reach USD 600, however, ETH would first need to get through several major levels of resistance in the chart, most notably at the USD 200, 300, and 500 levels.According to crypto analytics firm Skew, open interest in ETH options, meaning the number of options contracts that are traded either long or short, has risen steadily since the beginning of the year, now approaching levels seen before the Christmas and New Year holidays.However, it’s still clear that on the whole, few traders dare to bet on ETH prices of more than USD 600 by March. According to Skew’s calculations, the probability of this happening is in fact close to zero. USD 520, however, is estimated to be a slightly more realistic target, with a probability of 5%, Skew estimates."

February 04, 2020
","Arthur Hayes, the outspoken CEO of major crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX, shared several strategies for how yield-hungry crypto holders can earn income from their holdings, using derivatives.","In Hayes’ own words, his blog post, published today, is addressed directly to “those who want to earn a yield on their coin, those who need to pay bills in fiat without selling the coin, and those who need to smooth out their future return profile.”First off, Hayes explained how it is possible to obtain “physical” bitcoin without being exposed to price risk by using futures contracts to hedge with. This is essentially done by first buying bitcoin with fiat currency, and then short-sell bitcoin futures contracts worth the same amount of bitcoin. As a result, the trader will have a price-neutral bitcoin inventory, which can now be put to work to generate yield.Hayes went on to say that “Call Overwrite” is one strategy that in his view will become more prevalent in 2020, using an example where a bitcoin holder would sell “out of the money call options” to potentially generate a 10% yield in just one month.“These trades will be negotiated OTC [over-the-counter, meaning off exchanges],” Hayes explained, while adding:“Custodians of bitcoin will sell calls in size to large market makers. These custodians will then offer a monthly yield to customers who allow them to encumber their bitcoin. Finally, there is a real revenue stream open to crypto custodians.”Hayes also went into great detail on several other price-neutral trading strategies in the post, including a suggestion on how large miners may sell options contracts to generate a stable fiat revenue in order to cover their monthly operating expenses.“Similar to the bitcoin holder, the miner is relatively price / implied volatility insensitive. The miner’s main concern is meeting his monthly fiat bills. If the premium offered meets these goals, the miner is happy,” Hayes wrote while suggesting that a miner who has a rough idea of how much bitcoin he can mine each month can then sell an equivalent amount of bitcoin call options to generate fiat revenue.In 2020, “bitcoin needs to prove it is worth its salt as a true safe-haven asset in macroeconomic volatility. Crypto traders will rejoice as the low volume phase wanes. Those who demand income from their silicon enabled monetary instrument will be able to sell volume and clip a coupon. It’s like being on Oprah, [everybody] gets something from heightened bitcoin volatility,” Hayes concluded his post.In March 2019, Hayes predicted that bitcoin price will more than double and reach USD 10,000 per coin in 2019.

","Prominent gold bug and Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff is a genius. Okay, he isn't, but the apparent loss of his bitcoin (BTC) holdings has helpfully raised the topic of crypto-wallet security.","Yes, your holdings will most likely remain safe so long as you follow best practices, but the frequency with which people report lost crypto has revealed that things aren't as simple as they can be. And if crypto is to become mainstream, then holding onto your private keys, seed phrases and funds really should be idiot-proof.Fortunately, it's becoming easier to do this. New technologies for ensuring that you don't lose your crypto are emerging, from smart contract wallets to methods for guessing missing seed phrase words.But for the most part, seed phrase and wallet recovery will be a laborious task for the foreseeable future. So donâ€™t get too complacent.It's surprisingly common to lose crypto as a result of misplaced passwords or seed phrases.According to a 2018 report from Chainalysis, bitcoin holders had lost as much as 22% of all BTC in circulation at that point. This is a staggering figure, and it shows just how difficult it is for even early and relatively experienced traders to protect their funds.However, while Peter Schiff initially claimed he lost his Bitcoin as a result of a faulty wallet (and later he admitted that he was wrong), most experts working in the area of crypto recovery believe that the vast majority of popular wallets are secure.""Yes, they are reliable,"" says Arkady Bukh, a partner at Bukh Law Firm and a co-founder of the Bitcoin Recovery Co. ""It's really hard to make something stupid, once you get your seed phrase and backup you can always restore or reinstall it.""Bukh tells Cryptonews.com that the ""majority"" of his firms' clients lose their funds due to malicious software or outright scams. ""It's fairly rare now to see someone losing access to their legitimate account on their own,"" he adds.This picture is reinforced by testimony from another specialist in bitcoin recovery. ""Dave Bitcoin,"" of Wallet Recovery Services, agrees that problems with wallets are generally quite rare, and that what holders should really be wary of are malicious wallets.""When it comes to lesser-known wallets, malicious code is a much bigger problem than inadvertent bugs,"" he explains to Cryptonews.com. ""So one should always ensure they are choosing a wallet that has a high reputation amongst the crypto community before moving their funds into it.""Assuming that you have somehow been locked out of your own wallet, there are a number of ways you can regain access. Some of these are new, while some revolve around unglamorous detective work.""It can be challenging to restore or fix a wallet even when one has a backup file or the seed words saved,"" says Dave Bitcoin.""But again, the good news is that you don't have to worry about your funds being lost as long as you made the effort to keep recent backups or have a copy of your seed words or passphrase safely stored.""In the worst-case scenario, Dave explains that people whose wallets have somehow been corrupted ""might need help from the support team or the community"" in fixing the problem. Of course, since many non-custodial wallets lack a white glove customer service, this can be a painstaking and haphazard process.In the event that you do know your seed phrase, regaining access to a wallet that's developed a bug or been corrupt isn't particularly difficult.""It's really easy, worst-case scenario, with your seed phrase you can recover your funds,"" confirms Arkady Bukh. ""You can also reindex your wallet with all your transactions easily (backup).""Bukh doesn't think the process of recovery should be made any easier, since doing so could compromise security. That said, he does envision certain new methods appearing in the near future that should make things easier and more secure.""Someday, I believe we'll get to the point that cloud solutions will enable successful recovery for qualified users,"" he says. ""The main problem will be to qualify owners from fraudsters.""Bukh also notes that, if you look on Github or Stack Exchange, you'll find methods for recovering your seed phrase if you can't remember some of the words in it. Two well known open-source utilities in this vein are btcrecover and hashcat.Other than that, neither Bukh nor Dave believe there's much that can be done to recover lost seed phrases or corrupted wallets. But if you happen to hold a cryptocurrency other than bitcoin, you're likely to encounter at least one new recovery method in the not-too-distant future.If you own ethereum (ETH) (or any ERC-based token), for instance, you may have heard of Argent, a smart contract wallet. Argent enables users to recover their wallets even after they've lost their seed phrases, by appointing ""Guardians"" (either friends, hardware wallets or Argent's own Guard service) who are tasked with agreeing to unlock your wallet.Other software wallets (such as Gnosis) are looking into the possibility of using this smart contract-based mechanism of 'social recovery' to act as a last resort. This should make it less likely that other Peter Schiffs are locked out of their funds in the future, although given that such wallets will be based on software, you can't completely rule out the possibility that they too might sometimes malfunction.Learn more:

","The crypto market as of late has been enjoying a spring in the middle of winter. The second part of the first month of 2020 has brought a number of small and large rallies to a variety of coins, with the world’s number one crypto, bitcoin (BTC), surpassing the USD 9,000 mark yet again. How long a spring will last in the Cryptoverse is not something often predicted with any accuracy, but for now, we’re seeing its results in the overall green color of the market. Though we can't rule out that, in March, we'll discuss how bloody February turned out to be, for now, let's enjoy the fruits of this spring while they last.","January was more than kind to the top 10 coins by market capitalization. While only a single coin, tezos (XTZ) was in the positive in December, January saw a major change, with all its coins following tezos’ example. Winner on this list this time around is bitcoin SV (BSV), the price of which appreciated a whopping 191.62% amidst pump & dump accusations. The distant second is bitcoin cash (BCH), with a rise of more than 85% in a month, followed by litecoin (LTC) with 71.48%. Though BTC went up c. 30%, it's among those who appreciated the least. The only coin below it is XRP with 24.94%, while as the third in line stands binance coin (BNB) with a rise of 33.64%.Though many coins have appreciated this time among the top 50, there are always those who have appreciated the most. Among the ten winners, it's BSV that's leading the pack. BCH is now in the 9th place, with IOTA (MIOTA) following it closely on the 10th spot, while all other coins appreciated more than 100%. Dash (DASH) sits in the 2nd place, having gone up 180.40%, while ethereum classic (ETC), with a rise of 152.28%, took the 3rd spot. While it was impossible to have a list of 10 green coins for December, seeing the month close with only 8 winners, now there aren't 10 red coins for January. There are none! Focusing now on the top 100 coins, we find the situation similar to the top 50 coins, with large majority of the same coins standing at the top and BSV leading them. The only difference is that ETC is pushed a spot down by zcoin (XZC), which appreciated 166.35%. The least to rise are cosmos (ATOM) with 2.55%, and synthetix (SNX) with 0.32% rise in the month of January. We finally find some red coins here: seele (SEELE) dropped 41.77%, followed by ABBC coin (ABBC) with - 30%, as well as molecular future (MOF) with -24.67% and centrality (CENNZ) with -18.24%.Upon expanding the list to include the top 200 coins, the situation at the top changes only slightly. Now bosagora (BOA) sits in the 7th place with a rise of 142.14%, while swissborg (CHSB) is on the 9th spot with 131.09%.  However, we find more red coins on this list, with latoken (LA) dropping the most (26.56%), followed by MOF, and then educare (EKT), which fell 21.70%. The remaining red coins dropped less than 20%."

The pattern became more obvious after the price found support around the USD 52 level on January 24 and 25, and started trading higher again, forming the missing “handle” on the cup.On Thursday, the cryptocurrency, which was created by Charlie Lee as a near-identical copy of bitcoin (BTC) in 2011, then surged even higher, which confirmed the pattern, as well as a clear break-out through the 200-day moving average (blue line in the chart).The next step for litecoin’s surge to continue from a technical standpoint would now be to ensure that the 200-day moving average line goes from being a level of resistance to become a support level in the chart. This essentially means that we would need to see the price bounce back up if it were to touch that line again. With the currently strong momentum, however, such a re-test may not even necessarily happen.Both 100 and 200-day moving average lines are considered significant levels in the chart that many traders use to distinguish between bull and bear markets. For instance, Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors recently noted that bitcoin is “back in a bull market” after it broke through its 200-day moving average line.The cup-and-handle pattern, on the other hand, is often used to call major bottoms in markets. The pattern was first popularized in William J. O’Neil’s classic How to Make Money in Stocks from 1988, and has later become known as one of the most reliable bullish chart patterns among technical analysts."

","Cosmos (ATOM), ranked 16th by market capitalization, surged after popular crypto exchange Coinbase Pro announced it will list the coin.","As of pixel time (11:53 UTC), ATOM is trading at USD 4.28, up almost 7% over the past 24 hours, turning its weekly losses into a gain of 1%. While bitcoin (BTC) is down by 0.6% in a day, the sharp increase in price made ATOM the second-biggest gainer (the first - bitcoin SV that jumped 9%) among the top 20 token on Friday.Overall, the price of ATOM has risen more than 100% since reaching a bottom just below USD 2 in early September last year. The coin has thus far outperformed both BTC and Ethereum (ETH) over the same period.ATOM price chart:According to an update published by the exchange, inbound transfers of ATOM by Coinbase Pro users will be enabled on Monday, January 13. After at least 12 hours in transfer-only mode, full trading in ATOM/USD and ATOM/BTC will begin “on or after” 10 AM Pacific Standard Time (18:00 UTC time), depending on liquidity conditions.“Once sufficient supply of ATOM is established on the platform, trading on the ATOM/USD, and ATOM/BTC order books will start in phases, beginning with post-only mode and proceeding to full trading should our metrics for a healthy market be met,” the update said.Trading in ATOM will be available in “all Coinbase’s supported jurisdictions,” the update also said. For now, only users of Coinbase Pro will have access to trading, not regular Coinbase.com users.The update further stated that staking, which is normally an attractive option for ATOM holders, will not be supported for users who hold their coins on Coinbase Pro. According to Atomicwallet.io, the annual staking reward for ATOM holders ranges from 7%-11%, but it is still unclear if Coinbase will add support for this in the future.Cosmos (ATOM) has become known as a solution to interoperability between different blockchains operating on its decentralized network. This occurs via a “hub-and-spoke” model, leveraging elements from other blockchains to enable cross-chain interoperability."

","Some of South Korea’s leading crypto exchanges have apparently begun coin purges for low-volume tokens – but there could be a catch for the exchanges and the South Korean cryptocurrency industry as a whole, as a number of delisted tokens are Kakao Klaytn partners.","Per a report from South Korean media outlet News Tomato, the purges are taking place at the country’s “big four” crypto exchanges: Bithumb, Upbit, Coinone and Korbit.As previously reported, in the second half of last year all four exchanges independently declared they would be setting up token review committees in an effort to delist underperforming coins from their platforms, which many critics have previously called “bloated.”But there are signs that the delistings drive is set to intensify in the first half of 2020.The media outlet says that industry sources state that both Bithumb and Coinone have decided to delist three tokens apiece, while Korbit has also removed three tokens since it established its token reviews platform late last year.News Tomato quotes an anonymous industry insider as stating,“With the market still suffering, the number of projects that end up getting delisted may increase rapidly due to low trade volume figures. Delisting is now unavoidable in many cases.”Another unnamed insider criticized the move, stating that exchanges are “carrying out excessive delisting policies without considering the unique characteristics of the blockchain industry.”An unnamed official at one of the big four exchanges stated, however,“Project operators are responsible for liquidity management. A lack of liquidity often means things aren’t going well for a token.”The report points out that the Contents Protocol (CPT) coin and Cosmo Coin (COSM), both of which have been delisted by Coinone, stand out. Both are run by relatively big-name players and Klatyn partners, and the latter’s operator has also partnered with Samsung, which lists its dapp (decentralized app) on its mobile blockchain wallet.Klaytn has been experiencing massive growth since its launch last year. The blockchain network is backed by Kakao, the operator of the 50 million+ user chat app KakaoTalk and one of the biggest internet companies in the country.Cosmo Coin was created by Comsochain, maker of one of the world’s most popular dapps, while the CPT token is the brainchild of Watcha, which has also won Kakao funding, and has been dubbed by the media as “the South Korean Netflix.”"

February 10, 2020
","Justin Sun, CEO of Tron, has said that the native coin TRX is a shitcoin. The price of the ""shitcoin"" fell 4% in a day.","Sun, possibly inebriated, said in a short video by cryptocurrency podcaster Peter McCormack, that Tron is a shitcoin - a derogatory term the Cryptoverse uses for those altcoins it sees as worthless, pointless, or simply less than. So it's surprising that its own founder - who frequently promotes TRX and Tron blockchain as worthy of mass adoption - would define his coin this way. ""Buy my shitcoin,"" urged Tron's founder, laughing, with McCormack joining in on the laugh.My exclusive interview with @justinsuntron is now available.Hot tip for a Pulitzer. pic.twitter.com/TZaedkezOXThe 13th coin by market capitalization dropped 4% in the past 24 hours and has continued falling, but the market is generally in the red for the last day. It appreciated 11% in a week and 47% in a month, and it's currently (9:15 UTC) trading at USD 0.021. This wasn't the only surprise for the Cryptoverse though. Prior to this, a photo has been shared, taken at the Satoshi Roundtable event, depicting together Sun with Blockstream CEO Adam Back and creator of hardware devices the OpenDime and ColdCard Rodolfo Novak, who said in an apparent joke that Tron has a new home.We have a plan. #Ethereum is over. Tron moving to #liquidnetwork on #bitcoin. Cc @udiWertheimer pic.twitter.com/XEuw11PQKXIt's unlikely that there's work being done on integrating Tron with Bitcoin, though the discussions about this have continued, still likely in jest. The joke may be at the expense of Ethereum fans though, as these Bitcoiners seem to trolling them (and perhaps Tron along the way), by shilling Tron as superior to Ethereum (ETH). Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream, tweeted a comparison between ETH and TRX, in TRX's favour, while developer Udi Wertheimer also finds Tron superior of the two, and places Tron over MakerDAO.Letâ€™s do it! Polo on Liquid sounds great. ðŸŒŠCEO of Chainstone Labs and host of The Satoshi Roundtable, Bruce Fenton, going by the Twitter handle ""Bruce FenTron"" now,said that the event was pro-Ethereum and that the photo was just meant to be surprising given the combination of people it shows, with ETH supporters responding that the situation has gone beyond the photo.That said, while Sun ""LOLed"" the video, McCormack posted that he has completed his goal.- Tron is a stupid shitcoin- Justin isn't coming on the show- I haven't been paid anything by Justin- Justin hasn't lent me a private jetJustin admitted on camera that Tron is a shitcoin. Goal achieved. If anyone sees this & buys Tron then lol.Next? https://t.co/XfIN5sTs2zAngel investor and BTC maximalist, WhalePanda, tweeted saying that he thought the ""Tron thing"" stupid until seeing the number of triggered people, adding: ""ETH people calling Tron a scam is pure hypocrisy. If you call Justin a scammer, then so is Vitalik [Buterin]. Both a shady ICO with overhyped features and (at least in Tron's case) good marketing.""With the difference of course that Justin actually admits that his own coin is a shitcoin and he doesn't write a 5 page pseudo-intellectual article covering his own scamminess thus effectively making it less scammy than ETH.Well played exposing people's heavy ETH bags.People had various reactions to the video, with some taking it as a confirmation of their opinion, and others saying that McCormack played friendly with the drunk Sun to get a statement, thus taking advantage of him. Tron supporters found the act deceitful and manipulative. And while some say that alcohol brings the truth out of people, others find that this was an obvious joke on Sun's part. And while a majority, for one reason or another, is perpetuating the joke, others are warning of potential danger, such as Dovey Wan, a founding partner of investment company Primitive Ventures, saying that trolling like this is a bad idea, and that many will take it seriously.I had the exact reaction. Things are funny until they are not."

",Developers believe that Ethereum real-world blockchain applications could come too late – potentially leaving the door open for rival platforms to sweep in and “dominate.”,"Per a post from the recently formed Ethereum Marketing DAO, a group of Ethereum marketing experts, a “design thinking session” held with developers on Mural last year drew up a “top three” list of Ethereum-related “concerns that participants thought could be addressed through a Marketing DAO.”Topping the list was the “perception that Ethereum will deliver too few real-world applications too late, allowing newer blockchains to dominate.”The second-biggest worry, the group said, was that “Ethereum is complex and has numerous value propositions.”Experts have previously spoken out about the need to simplify the development process on the network, allowing space for less blockchain-proficient developers to create apps on the platform. The post’s authors stated that “tied for third” on the developers’ list of concerns was the fact that “It is difficult for people to know which Ethereum decentralized applications to trust.”The final item was the complaint that there were “not enough simple memes for average people to share.”To redress the adoption issues, the Marketing DAO says that it wants members of the public to submit ideas for projects that they believe would help market Ethereum to a wider audience.The marketing experts state that the Marketing DAO code was deployed to the Ethereum mainnet on October 18 last year.The move comes just under two weeks after developer Hudson Jameson, who's also the Ethereum Foundation’s community manager, conceded that he had “changed his mind” on the subject of Ethereum marketing, claiming that Ethereum needed “a lot of funding dedicated to marketing” to boost the popularity of the blockchain platform.I used to be in the ""focus on the technology and building above marketing"" group when it came to Ethereum.

","Crypto exchanges in Latin America are increasingly becoming embroiled in bitter struggles with domestic banks, with many banks moving to block trade with trading platforms.","Bradesco, one of the biggest banks in Brazil, appears to have won its fight against the Brazilian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain firms (ABCB), a group of domestic cryptocurrency exchanges whose case had been referred to an external adjudicator after it and other banks closed members’ accounts last year.Banks stated at the time that they were concerned by possible money laundering violations at Brazilian exchanges.Per Criptonoticias, the ABCB’s case was referred to the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), Brazil’s competition regulator, which ruled in favor of the banks.The ABCB last month lodged an appeal, complaining that the regulator’s ruling was riddled with “contradictions, obscurities and omissions.” The association has also disputed the CADE’s authority to rule on cryptocurrency-related matters, and had hoped to reach an agreement directly with the banks.But Bradesco has now filed an official response to the ABCB, refusing the terms of the association’s latest proposal, and claiming,“The alleged contradictions, omissions and obscurities pointed out [by the ABCB] were all correctly addressed by the regulator.”Meanwhile, in Chile, the Banco de Crédito e Inversiones appears to have taken a leaf out of the Brazilian bank’s book – and has moved to close the accounts of the nation’s first crypto exchange, Chilebit.Per a letter sent to the exchange in mid-December, the bank stated that Chilebit had 15 days to wrap up its dealings with the bank – and gave no reasoning for its decision.There is a faint glimmer of hope for crypto exchanges bemoaning their fate in Latin America, however: Spain’s Santander was successfully sued by Brazilian exchange Mercado Bitcoin in 2018, after the bank closed the platform’s accounts – with a court last year ruling in favor of the exchange in a subsequent Santander appeal case."

","Just when the Cryptoverse thought it'd never happen, the long-awaited dinner between Tron's CEO Justin Sun and a crypto-skeptic billionaire Warren Buffett was finally eaten in late January. Following the news, TRX jumped more than 12%.","Sun himself tweeted about the event with a lot of praise and enthusiasm, surprising the community that it happened at all. The CEO described the dinner as ""amazing,"" thanking Buffett for the shared advice.TRX is currently (15:45 UTC ) trading at USD 0.022. It jumped 12.7% in 50 minutes. Overall, it appreciated 12.34% in the last 24 hours and 22.22% in a week.Sun, along with Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, chief financial officer of the crypto exchange Huobi Chris Lee, chief executive of the trading platform eToro Yoni Assia, and head of Binance Charity Foundation Helen Hai, met Buffett on January 23 for a more than three-hour dinner at the Happy Hollow Club in Omaha, Nebraska, USA, reports Bloomberg. Sun himself said that paying USD 4.56 million in a charity auction to have lunch with the billionaire was worth the USD 515 dinner. Among a number of gifts Sun prepared, Buffett received 1 BTC, stored in a Samsung Galaxy Fold. ""Since I gifted him this Bitcoin, BTC has increased 16%! Hope it continues to moon,"" writes Sun. Besides the BTC currently worth USD 9,791, Sun also gave Buffett 1,930,830 TRX coins (worth USD 43,758), a number that corresponds with the recipient's 89th birthday. ""Mr. Buffett joked he wished he was born later so that he could have more,"" says Sun. The two also exchanged autographed books. (4/12)Showed Mr. Buffett my collaboration w/ @SamsungMobile on the Fold & how to transfer $TRX from one to another. I transferred 45,67888 TRX equivalent to the auction bid & Mr. Buffett was impressed by the speed of #TRON! Check out the Txn: https://t.co/2QTvmIcEf5As to what the group discussed, Sun shared that the conversation was led around Bitcoin, Tron, and Tesla, during which Buffett said Elon Musk is a great entrepreneur, but Tesla's not a good investment. ""The insights I received are priceless,"" he wrote in today's thread. Tron's spokesperson, Ryan Dennis, was quoted by Bloomberg as saying that Buffett ""shared a lot of his wisdom in business, investment and life in general,” bringing forth the evolution in Sun's approach to entrepreneurship, his outlook on investments and business, while ""there were a lot of conversations around blockchain and crypto."" According to Dennis, Buffett said that blockchain has its value: ""There are a lot of incredible companies in the payment realm, and it has huge demands. He believes blockchain technology will have a disruptive effect on the future of payment.” Dennis also shared that Sun is considering joining the Giving Pledge with Buffett and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to donate the to charity, Dennis said. Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, is quoted in the article as saying that the two had an “interesting and enjoyable discussion.” (8/12) @WarrenBuffett believes there is great potential in #blockchain & lots of his portfolio companies are exploring it such as @jpmorgan. He is curious to see how #blockchain will play out in the payment industry in the next 10 yrs. I have lots of work in store for me!""I told Mr. Buffett Bitcoin is the currency for the next generation,"" writes Sun, Mr. Buffett smiled and said “I’m sure my grandson would rather inherit my wealth in USD.” LOL!""As a reminder, Sun and Buffett, as well as a few high-profile guests Sun had invited, were supposed to have the lunch back in July. Sun cancelled it soon though, allegedly due to kidney stones. However, he later issued a long, now-deleted apology, saying that he’d been “immature” in his “excessive” promotion and over-marketing of the lunch. Many people at the time believed this to be a classic move meant to praise the Chinese leaders and get in the Communist Party’s good graces - which may or may not be the reason this dinner wasn't promoted until two weeks after it already happened."

","Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey still has not confirmed that he was awarded the second Lightning Torch on Tuesday, and does not respond to multiple requests by bitcoiners. ","Exactly a year ago, Dorsey received the first iteration of the torch, which has become a popular symbol in the world of Bitcoin, and passed it on. However, the newest pass to the CEO is something of a mistake since the Twitter founder never requested the torch. Without a request, there’s no invoice for the transaction – as is customary in these transactions. With no invoice, Dorsey has no obligation to pass the torch along. In other words, a Twitter user may have just donated a pile of satoshis (smallest units of bitcoin) to Dorsey.Almost immediately, after Pictosis co-founder Xavier Iturralde confirmed he sent the torch to Dorsey, Twitter exploded with responses. Many users expressed shock the passer wasn’t aware of the purpose or procedure of transferring the torch.@xavieriturralde @jack @lightning @bluewalletio @tippin_me Did you just send it to him with tippinme without him asking for it?Only Dorsey can pass the torch, and that can only occur if he’s willing to participate in the “Trust Chain” again.In either case, Iturralde claims he has a backup of the torch in case the CEO does not pass it.Meanwhile, multiple bitcoiners are unsuccessfully trying to reach the CEO.You have the #LNTrustChain2 via @tippin_me.Sent to you without you asking for it.Can you confirm and then send it on it's way?Hey @jack you have the power #bitcoin #LNTrustChain2 ⚡️## https://t.co/3lfUsGhVXp@tippin_me @jack Hey @starkness can you ping @jack and tell him that he involuntarily received the #LNTrustChain2 torch?The concept of the Lightning Torch was conceived by Twitter user and crypto pundit @Hodlonaut, also known for his conflict with Craig Wright.The idea of the torch was intended to show a chain of trust among bitcoin users.Each recipient passes the torch to someone requesting it, along with the original and subsequent additions. As the process continues, the sum of satoshis would accumulate. The idea is that each passing would show increasing levels of trust.The “Trust Chain,” as it’s called, was meant to prove the Lightning Network could function for rapid payments. It also showed transactions on the bitcoin network didn’t require any third-party exchange. The first Lightning Torch proved successful, traveling around the globe, and was received by many notable people."

","Fourteen of Japan’s biggest banks and securities companies will begin running a pilot for a blockchain-powered inheritance platform. The pilot, which is being spearheaded by the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, will begin in mid-February. If successful, financial institutions in the country could aim to roll the solution out before the end of 2020.","Per Nikkei, the Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank has been joined on the project by another Sumitomo Group banking subsidiary, as well as banking arms of financial heavy-hitters such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho and Nomura Securities.The project could also simplify the process for individuals wishing to change their name by deed poll – with blockchain technology helping people do away with lengthy, paper-intensive protocols.But the platform’s primary purpose appears to be simplifying the procedures involved when will issuers, banks and securities companies need to transfer the ownership of assets such as savings, stocks and shares from deceased clients to their legal heirs.The companies believe that their new blockchain-powered solution is tamper-proof and cost-efficient.They say that the solution could reduce the time it takes to complete inheritance transfers – a process that typically takes up to five months.Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank’s co-owned internet-only bank Sumishin SBI Net Bank has recently begun accepting fast fiat deposits for customers of the Huobi Japan crypto exchange. And last year, the same Sumitomo banking arm began pilots to test the efficacy of blockchain technology and AI solutions in trust business operations, in conjunction with NEC and IBM.

Santander’s InnoVentures investment subsidiary and Blockchain Capital were also named.Sony’s involvement was made through SFV GB, a venture capital fund jointly managed by its Sony Financial Ventures subsidiary, as well as Japanese VC firm Global Brain.The fund’s operators say they intend to make strategic investments in promising fintech startups across the world in a 10-year period, with a warchest of USD 45.9 million.Per the press release, the fund says that its objective is to contribute to Sony Financial Group’s “existing businesses and new business creation initiatives” as well as to “generate financial returns from its investment.” Sony appears keen to invest in startups that would be able to collaborate with its business units. This could be a hint that, through the Securitize deal, Sony may eventually look to tokenize certain aspects of its business operations.Junji Nakamura, director and member of the SFV board, said,“We are excited to take on this challenge with Securitize and create new value together.” Securitize has previously secured investment from bigger American crypto companies, such as Coinbase’s Coinbase Ventures and Ripple’s Xpring, as well as the KDDI Open Innovation Fund and real estate developer Mitsui Fudosan’s 31 Ventures.Sony is also looking to build “blockchain infrastructure,” per the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers – which is embarking on a music blockchain-powered copyright management pilot, along with five of Japan’s biggest music companies."

","Germany's newly installed cryptocurrency laws have made it illegal for new firms to launch crypto trading, custody services and issue tokens, according to experts.","Since January 1, the German Banking Act has stated that crypto assets now qualify as financial instruments and that crypto-exchanges and custodians now require a license from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).
However, what reports haven't noted is that, if a company is founded in Germany after January 1, it’s now illegal for them to issue tokens or offer custody and trading services.""They have to now set up a new legal entity since January 1 has passed,"" explains Philipp Sandner, a professor at the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center. ""But this new legal entity would be illegal for custody, trading and issuing.""In other words, the new law states that companies founded after January 1 need a BaFin license to offer these services. Meanwhile, companies that were founded before January 1, 2020 benefit from 'grandfathering' until November 2020.As Sandner and Germany-based lawyer Dr Johannes Blassl explains to Cryptonews.com, the cost of acquiring a BaFin license could be prohibitive for new startups.""For companies (be it startups or larger companies such as banks), the license induces costs of approx. USD 250,000,"" they say. ""Not every startup will be able to bear these costs. The small startups might be driven out of the market; the larger ones and the incumbents will probably apply for the license.""As for why the German government sought to introduce a law that might end up driving startups ""out of the market,"" Sandner and Blassl state that the government had the opposite intention in mind. It wants to encourage mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, rather than leave the sector open to unregulated smaller firms.They explain via email, ""This resulted in a 'crypto license' that (i) will drive some shaky startups out of the market but (ii) will let the solid companies in the market (iii) such that larger companies (banks, etc.) can build on this 'crypto license' as it increases investors protection (as with any financial market license out there).""So, token issuing, trading and custody services are illegal in Germany for some smaller firms without a BaFin license. But the end result should be to make crypto more accessible for institutional and retail investors alike.

","Tezos (XTZ), one of the best-performing cryptoassets of 2019, has seen another surge again over the past 7 days, making it the week’s top-performing coin among the 20 most valuable digital assets by market capitalization.","As of pixel time (11:46 UTC), XTZ is up 32.5% over the past 7 days, 6.5% in a day and is trading at c. USD 2.2. XTZ is currently ranked as the 11th most valuable cryptoasset by market capitalization (USD 1.5 billion).While it’s difficult to point to specific drivers for the recent rally, tezos was among the cryptoassets that were hard hit during the massive sell-off of 2018, currently trading down more than 80% from its all-time high in late 2017. Consequently, some traders seem to believe the coin has a significant amount of catch-up to do if the so-called altseason kicks in.XTZ price chart:That sentiment was mirrored by a popular crypto analyst and founder of Quantum Economics, Mati Greenspan, who in his newsletter on Wednesday declared that altseason is already here, saying “Heck yeah. It's been altseason mid-January.” He then went on to note that tezos is among the altcoins that “have been tracking some serious gains lately.”In addition to the strong sentiment surrounding altcoins, however, the popular crypto exchange Binance on Wednesday announced that it is listing futures contracts for the XTZ/USDT trading pair with up to 50x leverage. According to Binance, the contracts will be available for trading starting today (Thursday).Although listings of derivatives like options and futures contracts do not necessarily drive demand for the underlying asset by itself, it does help spread awareness of the project among investors, and can also be seen as a stamp of approval for the project by major exchanges.Finally, looking at the chart of XTZ, the asset looks promising from a technical analysis perspective. Last Sunday, the price broke through the major resistance zone at the USD 1.85 level, which has been an area of significant resistance since October of 2018. With that barrier now behind, there are few technical barriers left until the USD 2.4 level, and possibly all the way to USD 4.2, where previous resistance has been seen.However, not everyone is optimistic about the recent altcoin rally:Not to kill the vibe, but let's be serious -- a few weeks of healthy price action doesn't mean anything about a tok… https://t.co/Yxbeb2o8Aq"

","The widespread use of cryptocurrency as an alternative method of payment has led to a growing digital ecosystem over the years. Governments are behind the curve, continuing to wrestle with how to develop effective public policy measures to regulate its use. ","The Bank of Canada has been actively exploring the option of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to address the perceived threat of cryptocurrency for several years. This national digital currency would be centralized, meaning that the bank would be able to monitor and regulate the transactions within that network. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that relies on the application of cryptography to conduct financial transactions and protect against counterfeit and fraud. Cryptocurrency is an alternative to sovereign currencies that are issued by state governments, like the Canadian dollar.My doctoral research explores how states try to regulate cryptocurrency — a disruptive technology that threatens sovereignty that’s resistant to being controlled by any state unilaterally. The use of cryptocurrencies has broad implications for the global economy as well as the role of the state. As a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment network that allows individuals to share information with one another without the need for a middleman, cryptocurrency circumvents the control central banks have over money supply. Powered by blockchain technology, no single third party is in control of the transactions and data stored on the distributed ledger. As such, the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment has the potential to undermine the ability of the state to track currency movement.As a result, governments have moved to curtail cryptocurrencies, in some cases referring to them as a direct threat to national security and the stability of the global financial system. This move to classify cryptocurrency as a threat contradicts statements made by Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and current governor of the Bank of England. Carney challenged the role of the world’s reserve currency, stating that it could be replaced with a digital alternative.In a report commissioned by the Bank of Canada, findings suggest that Canadians now have an increased awareness of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and an estimated five per cent of Canadians actually own these digital assets. Government-owned digital currencies would likely run on a private blockchain, reducing transparency due to their centralized governance model. Private blockchains attempt to take the advantages of blockchain technology without giving up all of the control. This centralized approach increases the risk of a single point of failure as all of the data is stored in a single system.Storing immense amounts of data in a centralized location has not always been successful, often leading to data breaches and leaks. Furthermore, there would be easier access to data since hackers would only have to compromise a smaller number of nodes, compared to the amount of nodes in a public decentralized network.Traditional cryptocurrencies are decentralized and the transactions are validated and governed through consensus. This means that a majority of the nodes in the network would have to agree that a transaction occurred in order for it to be validated.The Bank of Canada’s exploration has suggested that establishing a digital currency would provide them with the ability to collect more information on Canadian consumers than ever before. These personal details and data could then be shared with third parties, such as law enforcement, which currently require a warrant to investigate the spending habits of an individual. The notion of collecting more information on Canadians through a proposed digital currency raises serious privacy concerns. While cash continues to be the only way to keep your transactions anonymous, the use of cryptocurrency leaves a detailed trail. By inserting themselves into the mix, the Bank of Canada aims to assert a new level of state surveillance in the digital economy.Although some cryptocurrencies provide users with aliases, there is no guarantee that the Bank of Canada’s digital currency would provide citizens with that same level of anonymity. A national digital currency that collects information on consumers has serious privacy implications, and one of the possible outcomes would be to replace physical money entirely. Institutional monitoring through digital currency spending habits raises concerns around the surveillance of minors, undocumented citizens and our right to privacy.As countries prepare to experiment and launch their own national digital currencies, they will also be faced with the issues associated with centralized governance.Every bit of data that the central bank can control, view and share about Canadians and their spending habits are a potential learning advantage for the privileged bankers, but not for the rest of society. Every restriction that the Bank of Canada faces, such as the increased use of decentralized cryptocurrency among the population, is a weakness — hence its experimentation with private distributed ledger technology.The introduction of any centralized cryptocurrency through the Bank of Canada must be subject to scrutiny since it would likely lead to an unprecedented level of state surveillance on Canadians. As we continue to experience more government and institutional monitoring, we must ask ourselves whether central banks are the right institutions to develop new digital currencies. What the Bank of Canada fails to understand is that historically, technology tends towards openness. The Bank of Canada’s approach to digital currency is no exception.Anwar Mohammed, PhD Student, Political Science, McMaster UniversityThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

February 06, 2020
","Many cryptos, including XRP and Ethereum (ETH) are still in the 'proving' phase, says prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull, Mike Novogratz, adding that these coins aren’t going to ""succeed as solely a store of value as BTC has taken that lane."" ","While BTC is a hard asset, having found its place as ""a weapon in macro portfolios as digital gold,"" writes Novogratz in a Twitter thread, other cryptos are venture bets that will obtain a lasting value only if they become a useful product. Ethereum ""might be the trust level people build on. If it does, it’s a great bet.""XRP has its own ""fervent community,"" mostly in Asia, but has a large supply - c. 57% - to absorb, he says. The price of the third coin by market capitalization will be determined like all prices: it will rise if there are more buyers than sellers, in combination with the company being in control. ""The company needs to distribute in a rational way at the same time building a real and scalable use case. I hope they do,"" concludes Novogratz.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, nor is it just an observation the author thought deserves a public comment. The BTC bull started today's Twitter thread by prefacing that Galaxy Digital, the merchant bank dedicated to digital assets founded by Novogratz, is ""a big investor in Ripple Labs,"" and that he'd like to see them do well. According to a public document from November 2019, Galaxy has invested USD 23.8 million into Ripple. He also compliments Brad Garlinghouse, saying that he has done ""a great job"" as Ripple's CEO.   However, Novogratz apparently wanted to address a somewhat controversial episode that occurred yesterday, following an article published by Coindesk, which claims to have obtained a recording from TD Ameritrade’s National LINC 2020 conference in Orlando, USA, last week, in which he allegedly said to a group of financial advisers that Ripple owns XRP 60 billion and compared the coin to a situation where a company continuously sells its shares, suggesting that Ripple will have an underperforming year. ""When I’m buying a stock, if I know [someone’s] selling USD 10 billion-worth of it at some price, it makes me less excited to buy the stock,"" he allegedly commented. As reported in January, Ripple reduced sales of XRP from its escrow fund last quarter when it secured USD 200 million in funding. Garlinghouse had fired back promptly, pointing at Novogratz's past inaccurate predictions.Also..this is the same guy that said bitcoin will go to 20K in 2019 ‾\_(ツ)_/‾ #notNostradamusHe did predict Tom Hanks would win an Oscar for Mr. Rogers - maybe this is the prediction he’ll get right? Personally voting for Brad Pitt though!Further explaining, Novogratz said in his thread that he made a comment on the XRP  underperforming BTC last year ""because Ripple owns a lot of them. I have been almost solely long BTC for the past 15 months."" He continued saying that this year the broader altcoin market, XRP included, has outperformed BTC. In the past 30 days, XRP is up by 28%, ETH - 45%, while BTC - 22%.  Many have also pointed the dangers of comparing XRP to shares given Ripple's ongoing case in which the company is accused of selling unregistered security, which they've repeatedly denied and are attempting to have the entire case dismissed. Meanwhile, we discussed the accuracy of Novogratz's predictions before, and he has just made another one - once BTC is USD 10,000, we're ""off to the races.""Crytpo is bid. Period. Hearing more and more inquiry. Always dangerous but higher prices are making me more bullish. $eth over 200 for a couple of days will open a bigger move. $btc has 10k looming. Once that goes we are off to the races.In the meantime, Ripple is currently (9:30 UTC) trading at USD 0.28. It's gone up 0.41% in a day, 19.16% in a week. This is compared to BTC's c. 3% in a day and week. ETH has performed the best of the three: 8.36% in a day, 18.29% in a week."

ETC price chart:Today’s price rally came two days after major crypto exchange Binance announced that it would launch ETC/USDT perpetual contract with up to 75x leverage. The new contracts were launched on Thursday at 8 AM (UTC).Also, ETC is rallying following the successful conclusion of the Agharta upgrade, which occurred last Sunday. The upgrade is said to make ETC more interoperable with Ethereum (ETH), which is currently the most popular platform for all types of decentralized applications (dapps). Interoperability and the rebuilding of ties between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is by many considered crucial for the success of the latter. As previously reported, ETC stood out during 2019 as one of the cryptoassets that were most uncorrelated to bitcoin (BTC), with several occurrences of large fluctuations in volatility independent of bitcoin."

","For many people Bitcoin is the synonym of cryptocurrency and the forefront of decentralization regarding blockchain technology.

","Britain’s highest tax authority, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC), has issued a request for blockchain analysis tools. The main goal, per the request, is to find and implement technology that allows the government to track and tax cryptocurrency users. ","The problem facing the British government, as well as all governments, is that cryptocurrency transactions are more difficult to track compared to electronic fiat transactions. Without a simple tracking methodology, crypto users are often able to fly under the radar of normal tax reporting services. Therefore, HMRC is looking for “a tool that will support intelligence-gathering methods to identify and cluster cryptoasset transactions into linked transactions and identify those linked to cryptoasset service providers.”Bitcoin (BTC) has proven somewhat simple to track, with wallet addresses being relatively easy to link to account holders. Other currencies, though, like Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), and Dash (DASH), are more difficult to track due to their privacy-focused features. As the tracking cryptocurrency transactions can be complex, and for a governmental agency to do so on a large scale requires sophisticated software, the tendered offer is for GBP 100,000 (USD 130,000). HMRC says that the system should be delivered by February of 2020. Last year, HMRC released a series of tax-related guidelines for individuals and in November said that firms will be obliged to declare cryptocurrency-related business actions on their company tax returns, and could be liable to pay multiple taxes on their crypto dealings.Back then, HMRC also stressed that it does not ""consider exchange tokens [Bitcoin and major altcoins] to be money.""In the same month, the UK announced that cryptoassets are to be treated as property, bringing the legal treatment of tokens into line with public perception.Meanwhile, other countries have also recently announced crypto taxing related news. As reported yesterday, the South Korean government is reviewing a proposal that could see it introduce a tax on cryptocurrencies, while new Russian Prime appears keen to see the government adopt a crypto tax law by spring 2020."

First, let's see what happened at the very end of 2019 and beginning of 2020.","Ethereum's unplanned Muir Glacier upgrade was two days away when 74% of the clients were ready for it, and finally the network saw a successful upgrade on the mainnet on Thursday, with ETH rising 4% in a week leading up to it. Meanwhile, blockchain-based content sharing platform DLive has become a part of the BitTorrent ecosystem, and the market wasn't interested. Coinbase is looking to recruit an office manager with accountancy, HR and building management skills, who'd be based in Tokyo, which might suggest it's set to ramp up its presence in Japan. Also, BlockFi aims to develop a BTC rewards credit card, which they might roll out this year. And while Mike Novogratz believes that Bitcoin will finish 2020 above the USD 12,000 mark, his previous predictions show just how unpredictable the crypto market really is. Opinion in Venezuela is divided on the Petro, as citizens continue to queue around the block for “up to seven hours” at crypto-friendly stores. In South Korea, lawyers and politicians have been debating the legality of the tax service’s recent decision to serve crypto exchange Bithumb with a USD 67 million tax bill. In Japan, Osaka prosecutors have charged Meijo Gakuin Educational Corporation executives with embezzlement, claiming they misappropriated local education authority funds to buy crypto. And in Russia, a programmer says he was tricked into handing over its entire assets of USD 450 million worth of crypto to fraudsters posing as the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation agents.

cryptoassets, you would never invest more than you can afford to lose.","
January 14, 2020
","Staking proof-of-stake (PoS) coins has become a popular way for crypto investors to earn investment income on their digital asset holdings. However, staking is not an easy feat for beginners due to the pitfalls that the uninformed could fall into. ","In this guide, you will discover the most important do’s and dont’s of staking to help you get crypto staking right from the start. In the cryptoasset markets, staking refers to providing a digital currency or token as a stake in a PoS network (Tezos, Cosmos, Decred, etc.) to play a role in the integrity and security of a blockchain. In exchange for this service, stakers are rewarded in newly minted coins. Therefore, from an investor’s point of view, “HODLing” and staking PoS coins is somewhat akin to investing in fixed income securities, such as bonds. Stakers are effectively earning interest on their holdings in the form of more of the digital asset they are staking. When making the decision to stake crypto, it is important to choose the right asset or assets to stake. Like with any other investment, you need to conduct thorough research on the assets you would like to hold to stake. It is advisable to look at factors such as market capitalization and trading volume (to gauge liquidity), historic price development, size and quality of the developer team or community, track record in meeting roadmap milestones, how the project fares against competitors, etc. As a general rule of thumb, should the asset you would like to stake not meet your standard digital asset investment criteria, then it is probably better not to stake the asset. While the general concept of staking is the same for every PoS coin, the actual staking process differs from blockchain to blockchain. As a result, it is important to fully understand the technical requirements and process involved in the digital asset you would like to stake. Should the technical requirements of the asset you would like to stake be too challenging for you, then maybe it would be a better option to choose an easier-to-stake asset. Looking at expected annual staking yields, you may assume that these annual returns are fixed. However, that is not the case (in dollar terms) as the value of non-pegged digital assets fluctuates quite substantially. It is, therefore, imperative to have a strong long-term conviction on the asset that you intend to stake because you will lose money if the value of the asset drops significantly and struggles to recover - even if you are earning “interest” in the form of new coins. Don’tsIt is tempted to choose the asset you will stake by ranking coins by their expected annual percentage ROIs on platforms, such as StakingRewards.com or Combatnerd.com. However, by choosing assets to stake purely based on expected returns you are likely to end up losing money. Many of the highest-yielding PoS coins have next to no liquidity and very small market capitalizations, which means it might be very difficult to sell your coins at a reasonable level once you decide to take profit. Moreover, these small capitalization coins are very susceptible to market manipulation. It is, therefore, important to choose assets based on a number of factors and not purely on expected annual staking yield. Several stakable assets come with lock-up periods during which the staker cannot sell his or her coins. Therefore, it is advisable not to stake coins that you need to (or want to) be able to sell quickly. Staking is really meant for asset that you intend to “HODL.” Therefore, you should be able to keep these coins or tokens locked up as your stake for a long period of time - ideally, several years. Regardless of whether you are investing in bitcoin or stakable cryptoassets, you would never invest more than you can afford to lose. Cryptographic assets are a highly volatile asset class where it is not uncommon for a holding to drop by 50% in value or more in a matter of months (or even days). Therefore, it is advisable only to put an amount of fund at risk that you would be comfortable to lose - if the worst case scenario would occur. Staking generally involves running a machine 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Since that can be challenging for small investors, many opt for exchange staking or the use of a specialist staking-as-a-service provider. While so-called “soft staking” provides an easy entry to staking and alleviate any of the technicalities of staking cryptocurrency, fees (in most cases) will eat into your staking returns and there is always a risk of loss of funds as you are not holding the private keys to your assets. Third-party staking services, therefore, need to be used with care. Learn more:

",A cryptocurrency investment company has hit a major law firm with a malpractice suit in a potential watershed case for the American legal and crypto worlds.,"According to legal documents submitted to a court in the American state of Illinois, Crypto Assets Fund has filed against Faegre Baker Daniels, one of the United States’ top 100 law firms per Am Law 100 ratings.Crypto Assets Fund, based in Chicago, allegedly took legal advice from Faegre Baker Daniels partner Jeffrey Blumberg, who told the fund’s founder Timothy Enneking that the cryptocurrencies that it wanted to offer its investors in 2017 would not be considered securities.Under American law, financial regulators have the power to determine if tokens classify as securities, and are thus subject to much-maligned legal restrictions that date back to the 1930s.Crypto Assets Fund says that the advice it received from the law firm in 2017 was “erroneous” and “inaccurate.” The fund went ahead with its investment drive, raising some USD 3.6 million – and resulting in an investigation from the regulatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The fund then turned to Faegre Baker Daniels to represent it during the SEC probe, but complained that the law firm’s “inaccurate analysis” led to “plaintiff damage.”Crypto Assets Fund eventually changed law firm and settled with the SEC in September 2018, paying a USD 200,000 fine and accepting an SEC censure measure.The fund claims damages of over USD 75,000 were incurred."

","It will be as normal for the majority of tech startups to have a crypto component by the end of this new decade as it’s normal for the contemporary ones to use the internet and machine learning, says the CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Brian Armstrong. ","Cryptocurrency will be shifted from trading and speculation primarily to real world utility, bringing a huge increase in the number of people holding and using crypto. But as crypto startups start rising, they’ll have to create a product people want. “The next 100M people who get exposure to cryptocurrency will not come from them caring about cryptocurrency,” says Armstrong, “but because they are trying to play some game, use a decentralized social network, or earn a living, and using cryptocurrency is the only way to use that particular application.” In a recent blog post, the CEO focused on the predictions, not just for 2020, but the entire decade in general, coming up with eleven conclusions on what might happen:As adoption accelerates, a more scalable and more private blockchain, will reach some 1 billion users by the end of the decade, up from about 50 million at its beginning, concludes Armstrong.

","As so many crypto startups hit the buffers fast while others experience sky-high growth, could there be a roadmap to crypto-powered success?","One major venture capital company thinks it has come up with an answer – and has outlined some “golden rules” that cryptocurrency-themed startups should follow if they hope to make it big in the increasingly competitive world of Bitcoin, altcoins and blockchain technology.California-based VC firm Andreessen Horowitz’s Crypto Startup School partner Jesse Walden has published a “Playbook for Building Crypto Applications,” labeling the guide a “possible path” to brighter things in crypto application.Here are Walden’s key pointers.Walden says that at the very first stage decentralization is actually a bad thing.Instead, “opinionated leadership to test hypotheses and update assumptions quickly” is what’s required. Firm decisions built on even firmer facts.The goal, he says, is “fostering harmony between passive users, more-active contributors, and the core team.”Vital takeaways here, he writes, are being brave enough to relinquish control to the community, and making sure you incentivize participation with tokens or fee streams – as users need to feel like they actually have something to gain from being part of your project.This might be the hardest of all steps for developers who have worked day and night on their projects. But it’s a necessary one for any successful crypto initiative. “Faking” decentralization – with core teams retaining control – is a fatal flaw for many ultimately unsuccessful projects.Instead, Walden says the core team must “cede majority ownership of the application (fees and control) and mitigated platform risk by ensuring the product is community-owned and operated.” Relinquishing control is vital at this stage, and “exiting to the community” must always be the ultimate goal.To do this, your project will need a “sustainable community-owned-and-operated network” – and presumably a lot of helpful community members!If this all sounds a little daunting, that’s probably because it is! As logical as the “playbook” sounds, the devil often takes the best-laid plans – especially in the crypto world.Although Walden states that “the most promising project teams I’ve spoken with have been navigating their way through this playbook,” he does concede,“So far, we have yet to see a crypto application execute each of the objectives sequentially.”"

","Russia’s parliament, the State Duma, could pass its long-awaited crypto laws as early as March – and it appears that the impasse between pro-crypto businesses and the crypto-skeptic central bank may finally be over.","Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the Duma’s financial committee, a lawmaker for the A Just Russia party and the man charged with getting the legislation through parliament, claimed that he was hopeful the Duma could pass the laws in the upcoming spring session.Aksakov stated, per state-run news agency RIA Novosti, that although the central Bank of Russia and other bodies had “conflicting views” on cryptocurrencies, the parties had now found common ground. The committee chief stated,“The disagreements had not been resolved to date. But last week another meeting took place, and they appeared to come to an agreement. A text is now being prepared, which will be submitted to the relevant institutions, including [the central bank].”This could lead, he said, to a second and possibly third reading for the bills, whose first readings passed the Duma almost two years ago.Russia’s central bank has long remained wary of cryptocurrencies. As recently as November last year, senior bank officials indicated that they would support a proposed national ban on crypto payments, claiming they “carry significant risks, including criminal money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities.”Earlier this month, Aksakov said that large Russian companies were “ready to use blockchain technology for economic operations” and admitted that it was now time “to create a legal framework” for crypto-keen Russian businesses.The bills were initially proposed as a package of three fintech-related bills in early 2018, only one of which has since been passed. Ongoing disputes between crypto supporters and crypto-skeptic state institutions have prevented the long-suffering Aksakov and his team from finalizing their legislative work."

","Around 7 undisclosed central banks, representing 20% of the world’s population, are likely to launch central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in 3 years, a new survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), showed.","While these banks remain unidentified, the BIS claims that having stronger motivations, emerging market economies (EMEs) central banks reported they are more likely to issue a CBDC.Central banks with firmer plans to launch their own CBDCs are “now imminently close to doing so,” BIS says. Compared to 2018 survey, there’s a noticeable increase in the possibility of a CBDC issuance, but it’s still low compared to some 70% of central banks that are unlikely to issue any type of CBDC in the foreseeable future. 10% of central banks say they are likely to issue a general purpose CBDC in the short term, which is twice as many as in 2018, and 20% in the medium term (1-6 six years).These results are found in the survey carried out in 2019, where some 66 central banks replied to the question if they work on CBDCs, and if so, what kind and how far they've come. These banks represent 21 advanced economies and 45 EMEs, covering 75% of the world’s population and 90% of its economic output, explains BIS.The survey further finds that:Looking at the greater picture, currently, a few EME central banks plan to issue a CBDC soon and have moved on from research to intensive development, such as developing the operational arrangements for a CBDC, amending laws to allow the central bank to issue such a coin, or piloting projects. Also, the plans of these banks seem to be speeding up, and more banks overall are or will be involved with CBDC, compared to 2018, finds the survey:When it comes to cryptocurrency, the 2019 survey results bring nothing new to the table compared to its 2018 counterpart: no central banks reported a significant or wider public use of cryptos for domestic or cross-border payments. However, some 60% of central banks are looking into the impact of monetary and financial stability of stablecoins. Still, the report notes that stablecoins pose a number of risks, particularly when available globally.Currently, many central banks are not analyzing the potential impact of private digital tokens, concludes the report, and the collaboration on understanding that impact may need to intensify. “Stablecoins could find widespread adoption where cryptocurrencies have failed,” says BIS, adding that the survey “shows that more central banks could be looking at the risks outside the financial system while also exploring ways to improve the system with CBDCs.”Meanwhile, we've seen that people are increasingly looking for faster and more convenient payments options. Also, a study by the central bank of Lithuania in December last year concluded that: ""Single-jurisdictional level initiatives are not capable of meeting a global citizens’ need for a safe, trustworthy, and cost-efficient instrument for cross-border payments."" However, ""modern-day technology seems to be able to address this need. […] The issue, including the idea of multicurrency CBDC deserves deep joint analysis."" Also, this week, thinkers at the World Economic Forum published what they call a CBDC “walkthrough” for bankers and governments looking to launch digital fiats in the near future."

",A report from South Korea claims that bankers in the country are concerned about the rise of an unexpected crypto threat – American coffee shop chain Starbucks.,"Per the Korea Times, banking professionals have theories about the company’s digitization plans, and worry that they will fall behind when the coffee company flexes its crypto muscles.The media outlet quotes an unnamed South Korean bank official as stating,“Starbucks has been regarded as a fintech firm, not a coffee company, over the past few years. The removal of the word ‘coffee’ from its signboard also proves this.”And the newspaper claims that domestic players are making “calls” for intervention from financial regulators, with a growing number of people hoping to “put controls on Starbucks.”The same media outlet quotes Kim Sang-bong, a Hansung University economics professor, as stating,“Regulations are needed for prepaid service providers to maintain a certain level of capital adequacy ratio.”Per multiple reports, Starbucks opens some 80 new stores in the country every year. Seoul allegedly has more Starbucks outlets than any other city in the world, including New York and the company’s native Seattle.The Korea Times quotes Kim Jung-tai, the CEO of the blockchain-keen Hana Financial Group as stating, in a recent New Year’s address to staff,“Technology has allowed coffee companies like Starbucks to become our rivals. It would be acceptable to call Starbucks an unregulated bank, not a mere coffee company.”The media outlet claims that the CEOs of rival banks Kookmin (KB) and NongHyup have also spoken about Starbucks in the past.Starbucks is one of the backers of United States-based cryptocurrency platform Bakkt, which named the coffee shop giant as its first launch partner for its consumer crypto rollout, slated for some time this year."

",The South Korean central bank is launching a second central bank digital currency (CBDC) team – a year after disbanding its first group of CBDC researchers.,"The central Bank of Korea (BOK) announced its intentions to launch the new unit, which it says will conduct CBDC-related research, in what appears to be a direct response to China’s plans to issue a digital yuan.Per media outlet E Daily, the BOK is still distancing itself from digital won issuance, stating,“Just because we have launched a research team, it wouldn’t be correct to assume that a CBDC is about to be issued. We will be more interested in studying how other countries are pushing ahead with CBDCs.”However, the move appears to be nothing short of a complete policy u-turn. Just under a year ago, the BOK claimed there was almost no chance of a South Korean CBDC seeing the light of day, giving this as its reasoning for dissolving its digital currency and cryptocurrency research task force team.And as previously reported, the BOK certainly appears to have changed its tune in recent weeks on the issue of CBDCs, stating that it is now “in the process of looking into” possible CBDC issuance.The BOK says its team of researchers will be small, with an initial eight members appointed, specializing in areas as varied as IT, human resources, economics and management.Although the BOK made no direct of mention of China in its briefing to the media, E Today reporter Kim Hye-mi wrote,“The People’s Bank of China’s aggressive bid to break ‘dollar dominance’ by using its own digital currency is thought to have led to the BOK’s change of heart.”As reported, around 7 undisclosed central banks, representing 20% of the world’s population, are likely to launch CBDCs in 3 years, a new survey by the Bank for International Settlements, showed."

","French football giants Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have launched a club-owned token named $PSG in a bid to boost supporter participation. The move came just hours after the club stepped up its crypto presence, penning a multi-year sponsorship deal with a cryptocurrency exchange.","PSG has used the Socios platform to carry out a fan token offering, as part of a plan it first formulated back in 2018. The club, which plays in the French capital, says its supporters can purchase $PSG fan tokens for “around two euros (USD 2.20),” per a Socios statement. The token price will fluctuate “depending on the exchange rate of Chiliz $CHZ [a cryptocurrency operated by Socios] at the time of purchase.”The club says fans can use their tokens to take part in votes via a smartphone app. PSG previously announced that token holders will be allowed to influence decisions on matters pertaining to the location of friendly matches, and designs for the next club uniform.PSG says that 20 million tokens have been made available for purchase, making for a potential total value of about USD 22 million.The development comes just a day after PSG announced its latest crypto deal, a partnership with CoinCasso, a Tallinn-based licensed cryptocurrency exchange and the operator of its own CoinCasso Exchange Token.The club did not disclose the value of the sponsorship deal.In March last year, CoinCasso announced that it had raised USD 2.5 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), where it sold 6 million CCX tokens.CoinCasso stated, in an official announcement, “Paris Saint-Germain is an innovator, having been one of the first to engage with blockchain players back in 2018. Together we share a leading position that will allow us to showcase the quality of our service around the world.”On January 29, at 11:00am CET, CoinCasso’s declared 30-day volume was USD 14,784.21.PSG currently sit 10 points clear atop the French Ligue 1 table – and are on course for a ninth league title victory.The club, which is owned by the State of Qatar’s shareholding organization Qatar Sports Investments, is also hoping to win their first-ever Champions League title, with a round of 16 match versus Germany’s Borussia Dortmund to be held on February 18."

",Dutch fintech company BUX has bought Amsterdam-based social cryptocurrency exchange Blockport for an undisclosed amount in a bid to spark interest from young European investors.,"BUX says the move will help address “the investing needs of European millennials.”The fintech firm plans to rename the platform BUX Crypto, and wants to make it available to users in the nine European countries where BUX is currently active.Blockport last year announced that it was temporarily closing down, citing a lack of funding, following a failed security token offering.The revamped platform is currently undergoing beta tests with a group of clients, and will launch in the first quarter of 2020, BUX said in a statement. The company will also register the platform with the Dutch central bank, and will seek to retain key Blockport employees.BUX, which launched in 2014, claims to have over two million users across Europe, and offers short-term, leveraged trading via its BUX X app. Its BUX Zero app, meanwhile, allows customers to make commission-free investing.The company has raised USD 35 million from the likes of Holtzbrinck Ventures, Velocity Capital, Orange Growth Capital and Initial Capital.Nick Bortot, the BUX CEO and founder, said that his company’s customers “have long expressed interest in investing in cryptocurrency.”He added,“We have been presented with an opportunity to bring on a committed and enthusiastic team that aligns clearly with our mission at BUX. This mission is to help young Europeans do more with their money.”Blockport said,“We have found a great partner to launch our platform with and that the outlook is very promising.”Blockport also stated that BUX was a “bigger player,” and Blockport will extend BUX product line with their cryptocurrency investment platform.Bortot said that the deal would also allow BUX users to access a range of financial assets and markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP.BUX says it “welcomes new regulatory requirements in the Netherlands and across Europe,” claiming new rules will “help clear the field of those who chose not to operate with transparency and heighten the reputation, responsibility and integrity of the industry.”As reported, major crypto derivatives exchange Deribit is moving from the Netherlands to Panama due to the regulatory pressure. The reason behind it is that the Netherlands will most likely adopt a strict implementation of new EU regulations (5AMLD), which would mean that Deribit has to demand an extensive amount of information from the current and future customers."

","Juan Villaverde is an econometrician and mathematician devoted to the analysis of cryptocurrencies since 2012. He leads the Weiss Ratings team of analysts and computer programmers who created Weiss cryptocurrency ratings.
","We rarely make a big deal about crypto tech upgrades. We dissect them. We run them through our technology model. And we give you our objective analysis. Period.But this is an exception. Ethereum 2.0 is now finally moving forward in a substantive way, and it’s slated to have far-reaching consequences — not just for Ether itself, but for virtually the entire crypto space.Reason: Ethereum (ETH) remains, far and away, the world’s most popular smart-contract platform.It’s where thousands of projects reside. And it’s the platform where folks all over the world are scrambling to build the virtual economy of the future.The Ethereum network is so popular, in fact, that it’s routinely overloaded. Transaction times become agonizingly slow. Transaction fees become exorbitantly expensive. And it’s mostly been this way since 2017 — a chronic ailment that challenges the best minds.Bad news? Not entirely. Developers and sponsors of other, competing smart-contract platforms often wish they could have the same “disease.”Chronic congestion on the Ethereum network signals vast and growing worldwide adoption, arguably the single most important factor in the long-term success of any cryptocurrency.But the big disparity we see between popularity and practicality cannot last forever. Ethereum users can only put up with annoying network congestion for so long before they start looking for alternatives.That’s what has given rise to the likes of Cardano (ADA), EOS (EOS), Tezos (XTZ), and others, all promising to be “new and improved versions of Ethereum.”Would any of them make sense if Ethereum was already the fastest and cheapest smart contract platform on the planet? Probably not.This is one reason why Ethereum 2.0 is such a big deal. If it works, it could seriously throw into question the raison d’être of wannabe Ethereum killers that have staked their futures on knocking the world’s No. 1 smart-contact crypto off its perch.Why? Because according to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, when Version 2.0 is fully implemented, the time required to confirm a transaction will drop from minutes to a meager three to six seconds — about as long as it takes to swipe a credit card.Two major upgrades in the Ethereum code would make this possible.Remember: A blockchain is a database. And as the name implies, the databased is made up of a chain of blocks. Each block records a batch of transactions. And each block is linked to the next block in the chain in chronological order.The problem: If there’s just one single blockchain on which ALL transactions must be recorded, it can create a massive traffic jam.Imagine a single-lane superhighway with new traffic trying to ramp in from all sides. One obvious way of solving the problem: Build more lanes. In other words, run a bunch of parallel blockchains at the same time. Each shares its work across the group.Easy to say. Not so easy to do. And Ethereum is not the only one dealing with this issue. Other crypto projects have also been looking for solutions along these lines. They have the main blockchain. Then, they create a series of sidechains to share the workload. Think of it as the main highway flanked by side roads.Can this boost speed? Sure. But it’s still a fundamentally flawed design because the sidechains all have fed into the main blockchain, which effectively creates a new bottleneck. What’s worse, each sidechain has its own tokens, rules, and validators. So, things can get too darn complicated.Ethereum 2.0 does things differently; it uses a process called “sharding.”Forget the superhighways and the side roads for a moment. Instead, walk over to a giant, disorganized library — so big and disorganized that it could take you years to find a single book. One possible solution: Assign each floor of the library to a single broad topic. Assign each row of bookcases to a subtopic. And then line all the books up alphabetically by author.This is akin to sharding in the world of databases, with each shard representing one piece that’s ultimately interconnected with every other piece. And it’s not entirely new: Sharding is already a technique that tech giants routinely use to expand their massive databases.Until now, only a few crypto development teams — Cardano, Hashgraph and now, Ethereum — have even figured out how this might be done in theory. None of them has actually implemented it in the real world.The big news: Ethereum 2.0 may soon become the very first to do so.One of the key reasons Ethereum has not been able to scale up to meet booming demand was that it essentially copied Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work approach.With Proof of Work, miners compete to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle. Then the winner gets to write a new block of transactions to the blockchain and claim the reward for doing so. This mining requires faster and faster computers, consumes massive amounts of electricity and ... takes TIME!But in Version 2.0, Ethereum is slated to switch from the sluggish Proof-of-Work method to a much faster and efficient Proof-of-Stake approach.It’s kind of like a lottery system. If you’re participating on Ethereum 2.0, each token you hold (ETH) resembles a lottery ticket. The more tokens you have, the better your chances of being chosen to write a new block to the blockchain and claim the reward.Again, this is nothing new. Second- and third-generation blockchains already use Proof of Stake and do so pretty successfully. But Ethereum 2.0 adds some valuable new wrinkles.All very exciting! But don’t expect instant gratification. Upgrading a public open blockchain — especially one as popular as Ethereum — is an epic undertaking, akin to overhauling motorcycle engines while careening down the highway.In fact, it’s so difficult that legions of skeptics have famously doubted Ethereum 2.0 could ever be implemented. Now, however ...Ethereum developers have finally revealed their roadmap to Version 2.0, and it’s remarkably elegant in its simplicity.The main idea: The existing Ethereum network won’t actually be upgraded at all. Instead, Ethereum 1.0 will continue as before. And developers will release the first iteration of Version 2.0 right alongside it.None of the current Ethereum users will get a black eye if they decide not to switch. Meanwhile, as the overhauls are implemented and refined, the original Ethereum will be gradually phased out."

",A report claims that the infamous North Korean hacking group Lazarus used LinkedIn and Telegram messages as part of a raid that saw it make off with some USD 7 million from Singapore-based exchange DragonEx in March 2019.,"Per Radio Free Asia, which quoted data from the Chainalysis 2020 Crypto Crime Report, Lazarus hackers created what appear to be fake LinkedIn accounts, in a bid to distribute malware that “senior managers” at the exchange installed on their computers. The report contains screenshots of a LinkedIn profile for a user named Gabe Frank, listed as the “founder“ and “Tech CTO” of a “wallet company” named WFC Proof.According to Radio Free Asia, Chainalysis claims that the hackers, posing as Frank, sent unnamed executives at DragonEx messages via both LinkedIn and Telegram and eventually convinced them to download the malware – believing it to be the trial version of an above-board cryptocurrency trading bot.Instead, it appears the program contained malware that allowed Lazarus to obtain the private keys for the exchange’s wallets.In a previous excerpt from the Chainalysis report, the firm claimed,“While the DragonEx hack was relatively small, it was notable for the lengths Lazarus Group went in order to infiltrate the exchange’s systems in a sophisticated phishing attack. Lazarus created a fake company […] complete with a slick website and social media presence for made-up employees. Lazarus even went so far as to build a software product resembling the trading bot they claimed to be selling.”Learn more:

","The plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and its parent company, iFinex, operator of stablecoin Tether (USDT), accusing them of manipulating the Bitcoin (BTC) market, have voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit.","Updated on January 13:
Soon after the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex and its parent company, iFinex, operator of stablecoin Tether (USDT) had voluntarily withdrawn the lawsuit, a revised lawsuit was refiled on January 8 in New York’s Southern District, demanding a jury trial. Besides Eric Young and Adam Kurtz, a third plaintiff, David Crystal, was added. Additionally, a very similar class-action lawsuit by Bryan Faubus, who claims to be a BTC trader, was filled on January 9 to the Southern District, and it directly cites the lawsuit by Young, Kurtz and Crystal.
Filed in the Western District of Washington court on January 7, the Notice of Voluntary Dismissal states that plaintiffs Eric Young and Adam Kurtz, by and through their counsel, ""hereby voluntarily dismiss their claims without prejudice against Defendants pursuant,"" proposing an order by which all the claims given in the complaint against Bitfinex, Tether and other related organizations and persons who are defendants in the case would be dismissed. The document adds that the defendants have not served an answer or a motion for summary judgment to Young's and Kurtz's complaint. However, the notice doesn't give a reason as to why the two plaintiffs have decided to make this move. When a case is dismissed without prejudice, it leaves the plaintiff free to bring another suit to the court based on the same grounds. It means that Kurtz and Young have the option by U.S. law to file the suit again, unless the order for dismissal denies it, but were it to be dismissed once more, the plaintiffs would lose the right to bring it to the court. For a short recap, this particular lawsuit was filed back in November, to which the exchange replied with threats of retaliatory legal action. They called this a copycat lawsuit, as it was the second lawsuit filed against them for market manipulation and for allegedly causing the biggest-ever financial bubble. This first lawsuit by five plaintiffs was filed in October with the New York Southern District Court. Both of these have been based on and/or have cited the controversial study  which claims that tether was used to manipulate bitcoin prices in 2017 on the Bitfinex platform, leading to a major BTC rally.Meanwhile, earlier in 2019, New York’s Attorney General (AG) Letitia James filed an order to the state Supreme Court in April, alleging that Bitfinex and Tether engaged in a cover-up after losing about USD 851 million of client and corporate funds. Bitfinex responded with legal measures of its own, leading to a second AG memorandum of law in May, followed by another one in July, affirming its previous motions."

","Namebase and its blockchain Handshake have officially gone live, allowing their users to send funds to a simple name, instead of a complicated address. ","Handshake is a decentralized, permissionless naming protocol compatible with DNS (Domain Name System, a hierarchical and decentralized naming system), created by Namebase, an exchange, cloud wallet, and registrar for Handshake names and native coin HNS. The startup claims that a total of USD 10.2 million has been raised, with Handshake investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, and SV Angel. Namebase describes Handshake as ""an experimental project that makes DNS more secure."" It claims that the centralized nature of internet names can lead to censorship and loss of privacy, but also that top-level domains are limited. The FAQ further explains that billions of dollars are “being moved around on potentially insecure websites. If you’re personally identifiable as the owner of a valuable asset, there’s a risk to your personal safety.”The goal of Handshake is to simplify the entire transaction process and make it both easier and safer by allowing users to name the domains, instead of using complicated addresses that often have to be copied and pasted to complete a transaction. Handshake, however, will be using names so that, in order to complete a transaction, the users just need to type specific names of whom they want to transact with. These can be used like a traditional top-level domain (i.e. my.wallet/) or by themselves (i.e wallet/), as a standalone name. DNS records can only be modified by a domain’s owner, claims Namebase.The owners are free to do with their Handshake domains what they want - to receive crypto, included. ""They can use it for their own site or become a registrar that sells subdomains — i.e thisis.cool or my.wallet — to other users,"" explains Namebase.Furthermore, these domain names will be registered on Namebase's own blockchain, while the Handshake HNS coin will be used to transfer, register, and update them. The mainnet has been launched on February 3 and the miners were able to start mining HNS, but other transactions, namely transfers, claiming and bidding are not enabled yet. This will happen on February 17, according to the timeline, when the first batch of Handshake names will be released for bidding. Handshake domains are initially offered through an auction and bid with HNS to ensure a fairer distribution, says the website. Additionally, using HNS is meant to prevent Sybil attacks and one party claiming all the names. On March 1, the first Handshake name auctions will close. Names will be released for bidding over the course of 52 weeks, with a new batch of names unblocked every week. Meanwhile, this Handshake option is similar to what the Ethereum Name Service offered in August 2019."

","Ethereum (ETH), the second-most valuable digital asset by market capitalization, has become the “most relevant benchmark of the crypto market” in 2019, a new research from Binance Research claims.","According to them, ETH displayed the “highest median correlation” with other digital assets over the course of last year, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.69. For purposes of the study, assets with a correlation above 0.5 were considered to have a strong positive relationship, while assets with a correlation below -0.5 were considered to have a strong negative relationship. The higher the number, the stronger correlation is.Cardano (ADA) and EOS followed ETH, with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.66, respectively. That compares to a correlation coefficient of 0.31 for cosmos (ATOM), which was the least correlated digital asset for the year, followed by chainlink (LINK) and tezos (XTZ).Comparison of quarterly average correlation coefficients for the five highest correlating assetsFurther, the report also explained how this insight may be used by traders and investors to achieve their diversification goals:“If the returns of two assets do exhibit a positive correlation, it implies that these two assets tend to move in the same direction, and therefore share similar risks. On the other hand, a negative correlation between the returns of two assets indicates that the two assets move in opposite directions, and it is thus possible to use one asset as a hedge against the other,” the report said.On the whole, however, Binance concluded that all cryptoassets continue to be “highly correlated with each other,” which is something that has been noted by many crypto analysts over the past few years. Despite this, however, the correlation was found to have “slightly declined” during the 4th quarter of 2019, per the report.As reported earlier in January, a research from crypto exchange operator SFOX also found a decrease in correlation among cryptoassets. However, it still remains to be seen whether the decrease in correlation within the crypto space is the beginning of a new trend that will continue into 2020, the exchange noted back then.

","There are new developments coming from the New York-based international investment giant WisdomTree Investments, as it now plans to launch a stablecoin, and it wants to do so ahead of the competition.","It's a busy period for WisdomTree as the news is out that they plan to issue their own regulated digital token. Financial News reports that the company wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve and regulate their new product. It’s not clear, however, whether any talks with the U.S. financial watchdog have started, nor have any additional information about the alleged upcoming stablecoin been provided. We have contacted WisdomTree and will update the article should there be a response.Additionally, it seems that the ETF (exchange-traded funds) and ETP (exchange-traded product) sponsor wants to be the first one among the giants to offer this product. “You want to be early,” Jonathan Steinberg, founder and chief executive officer of WisdomTree, is quoted as saying in the article. “We came to ETFs 13 years after State Street. This gives us an opportunity to be ahead of the State Streets, Fidelitys, on regulated stablecoins.” Among the competitors, State Street is a custodian bank that partnered with crypto exchange Gemini on a digital assets-reporting project, while fund manager Fidelity Investments has been also active in the crypto space. Fidelity rolled out its much-anticipated crypto custody solution in October last year, created a tokenized rewards system for its employees with security token expert Tokensoft in November, and it announced it’s set to expand into Europe with a new UK-based branch in December. A spokesperson for Fidelity is quoted in Financial News as saying that the company “welcomes continued innovation in the digital assets space.” Furthermore, William Peck, WisdomTree’s director of corporate strategy, said that via the stablecoin project, the company wants to enable access to traditional assets like gold or property over the blockchain. Steinberg was quoted as saying that, by allowing for an easier trade in assets, the project could give the company “a Facebook-like role for financial institutions.” Facebook, on the other hand, has been trying to push through its Libra digital coin since its announcement last June but has led an ongoing battles with regulators, resulting in several backers backing out, such as MasterCard and Visa. The SEC is also notorious  for rejecting or postponing then rejecting ETF proposals.Meanwhile, as reported, WisdomTree launched its first cryptocurrency product in December 2019 – a physically-backed Bitcoin ETP, the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETP (BTCW), which is listed on SIX, the Swiss Stock Exchange.Following that, in January 2020, the company, which has USD 63.8 billion in assets under management, joined Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO) and other investors in financing Securrency, a Washington-headquartered developer of institutional-grade blockchain-based financial and regulatory technology. The goal of the investment is the integration of blockchain technology into the ETF ecosystem."

February 07, 2020
","We have been reporting for a while now about the massive growth the DeFi (decentralized finance) ecosystem is experiencing, and today, the Cryptoverse saw another major milestone reached - total value locked in DeFi surpassed  USD 1 billion, before dropping below this threshold again.","The total value locked (TVL) has been steadily climbing since December 2017, seeing substantial growth in 2019. It has been surpassing new all-time highs one after the other for the entire 2019, displaying an explosive growth of DeFi. Compared to February 2019, the TLV is now 262% higher, according to DeFi Pulse.Maker still dominates the space in a major way - 59.7% of it - as it currently has USD 597.1 million in assets locked up, and it itself has been reaching new all-time highs since the beginning of February. Prior to that, its highest point was USD 505.4 million in June 2019.Compared to Maker, the second-placed Synthetix has USD 149.2 million locked up (dropping 1.1% in a day), and third-placed Compound has USD 125 million (rising 3.3% in a day). The rest have less than USD 100 million each.The Cryptoverse was quick to notice this major development, even watching the number prior to it hitting 1 billion, waiting for the big moment.Anthony Pompliano, co-founder and partner at digital asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital, tweeted that this is a ""pretty cool milestone to see,"" while Ryan Sean Adams, the founder of investment company Mythos Capital, also shared a number of milestones that crypto space has seen in the past seven years, predicting a successful decade ahead.$1 billion locked in DeFi for the first time everBitcoin hit $1b in 2013Ethereum hit $1b in 2016DeFi hit $1 billion in 2020Historical milestonesSoftware eating moneySoftware eating banksThe next decade will be wild🚀Spencer Noon, head of crypto investments at DTC Capital, noted that the TVL went ""from one million to *ONE BILLION* in only 878 days"" and that this is a historic day.Meanwhile, as reported, financial technology and data company Digital Assets Data finds that organic user adoption could be a challenge for DeFi space in 2020. Following their analysis of Maker's Dai Stablecoin System and the current distributions, the company says that the majority of assets being locked and borrowed in the DeFi space is actually the responsibility of just ""a few addresses."" Also, talking to Cryptonews.com, Loi Luu, CEO and Co-Founder of Kyber Network, open source, on-chain liquidity protocol, said that they're “very excited” for DeFi, finding that many in the space share that enthusiasm, particularly given the increase in the number of DeFi users, and that total value locked in DeFi has been reaching all-time highs.""We foresee that with DeFi, important wealth-building and business tools such as applications involving loans, insurance, investments, and other financial services, become much more accessible to people around the world. Anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone or laptop will be able to connect to the public blockchain network, use DeFi platforms, and participate in the global digital economy.""There will be more governmental and regulatory support for blockchain and DeFi with greater regulatory clarity and understanding of the space, leading to mass adoption. Furthermore, says Luu, more professionals and developers from traditional finance will see the value of DeFi “and we will see the DeFi space flourish, with a brain drain of talent going towards DeFi startups.”

",Poland’s competition regulator the UOKiK has warned the public about against the alleged scamcoin DasCoin. The watchdog also orders the token’s operator to cease its “illegal activities.”,"The token was exposed as a scam in May last year, following on from a probe into the DasCoin creators instigated by Polish prosecutors.The regulator said, in an official statement, that it believes CL Singapore, the DasCoin operator, “violated consumer interests.”The UOKiK explained,“CL Singapore established, operated and propagated a network of independent representatives, called NetLeaders, rewarding them with a so-called NetLeaders Remuneration Plan.”Instead of rewarding token holders for sales, plan participants were offered benefits for introducing news customers – in classic Ponzi style.The UOKiK says it has ordered the company to “cease” such activities.In what is possibly Poland’s largest cryptocurrency-related Ponzi scheme, the alleged scamcoin’s creators appear to have cheated investors out of an estimated USD 66 million, according to data obtained by newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna.Before prosecutors took action in June 2018, the operators had managed to sell some 100,000 “licenses,” priced at between USD 111.6 and USD 27,900, says the watchdog.Payments were accepted in euros, bitcoin and gift codes.The prosecution’s investigation is still active, and some USD 11.6 million in assets have been seized from a bank account linked to a DasCoin operator.In October 2018, the Warsaw-based Trading Jam Foundation published a letter from the District Prosecutor’s Office in the Polish capital, stating that prosecutors were investigating the cryptocurrency’s creators for suspected criminal violations.Polish law stipulates that offenders in cases of fraud and deception can be punished with prison terms ranging between six months and eight years.DasCoin has not responded to a Cryptonews.com request for comment."

","After three months since the initial announcement, the challenge to get one million developer to build on Ethereum (ETH) is now officially on.","Last October, as reported, at the Devcon 5 conference held by the Ethereum Foundation, Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and founder of blockchain company ConsenSys, announced the mission to get 1 million developers on this platform by the Devcon 6 this year.It’s been quiet since the announcement, and the amount of information on the website as to how Ethereum plans to accomplish this feat has been changing. Finally, yesterday ConsenSys Open Source Chief, Jim Jagielski, tweeted that the 1 million effort is officially launched.Join me as we ""officially"" kick off our #1milliondev effort, dedicated to growing the #Ethereum and #Web3 communities by 1 million developers and contributors. Let's leverage #opensource in this endeavor! \c @ConsenSys https://t.co/Rs2whnS8z1Indeed, the onemilliondevs.com website has been transformed since we first reported on the effort, and now offers a list of meetups, conferences, hackathons, as well as assistance with finding a job as a crypo developer, etc. As project partners, the site names the Ethereum Foundation, ConsenSys, and Gitcoin, an open-source bounties platform on the Ethereum blockchain.An emphasis is yet again placed on Web 3.0 as the next evolution of the internet, with the site making a distinction between a Web 2.0 and a Web 3.0 developer. The latter, it says, is a Web 2.0 developer with an expanded, blockchain-enabled toolkit containing new tools. It offers the choice of “path” to the interested developers, based on their experience, between starting as a Web 2.0 developer, a Web 3.0 beginner, and a Web 3.0 expert.Another point of emphasis is the so-called “a-ha moment.” Lubin is quoted as saying by the website: “The first Ethereum a-ha! moment is when you send ether to someone anywhere in the world at any time of day for less than a penny and they receive it instantly.” He adds that this is how people realize they can be their own bank and that they can build and run an alternative global financial system allowing “greater economic and political agency for any participant on the planet.” It’s difficult to come about the information on the exact number of developers currently developing on the platform, though the website claimed it to be more than 200,000 active developers back in October, while only recently the website showed zero instead of 200,000. The site says that the platform’s dominant community is “orders of magnitude larger than the next biggest blockchain competitor, and is comprised of thousands of brilliant collaborators.”As to how they plan to reach the 1 million number, they put it in the community’s hands, saying it’ll happen through a collaborative effort with everybody contributing what they can, even if sharing it on Twitter. They did not specify when this number should be reached. Also, as it was promised, the site offers ways for developers to get more engaged with the content, learn about the platform, and possibly even bring in other developers. It comes with the Ethereum Studio with templates for building one’s first app, a guide to becoming more bankless, as well as Gitcoin Quests for developers to learn about Web 3.0 in a gamified way. Meanwhile, as reported, developers believe that Ethereum real-world blockchain applications could come too late – potentially leaving the door open for rival platforms to sweep in and “dominate.” Therefore, Marketing DAO, a group of Ethereum marketing experts, has been recently formed in an attempt to help market Ethereum, which is moving towards Ethereum 2.0, to a wider audience.At pixel time (14:39 UTC), ETH trades at c.  USD 168 and is up 2% in a day and 8% in a week, increasing its monthly gains to almost 30%. The price is up by 43% in a year."

If an experiment is a fraud, it will be a fragile one and will not stand the test of time. Raging on Twitter isn’t going to expedite that process, it only makes people look unstable. And it drives people away, slowing the adoption of crypto planet-wide.”Arrington took the time to single out Bitcoin for praise, stating, “Bitcoin is more ‘gold’ than gold is. It is the most perfect money ever conceived.”He called the next 10 years ahead “a decade of crypto.” And he issued a warning to central governments, who, until now have held a firm grip on the financial system. He claimed crypto would “empower the individual as it weakens the power of the state to wage war and spread human misery.”The TechCrunch founder says that he has “staked his career” on cryptocurrencies, and compared crypto advocacy to “religious” fervor.Arrington ended with a rousing call to action, writing: “Embrace the liberty. Embrace crypto.”

","Should interest in spot trading wanes, this year will see crypto derivatives rising, with futures and options contracts taking a larger market share, estimates TokenInsight, a token data and rating agency. Also, competition for institutional clients might force exchanges to lower fees, they added. ","In 2019, the volume of OKEx futures was 2.24 times the volume of spot trading; there were 238 days of BitMEX trading volume reaching more than twice that of Binance, and only 8 days of Binance spot trading volume exceeded BitMEX, the agency said in its 2019 Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange Industry Annual Report. “If the spot market continues to be sluggish, it can be predicted that the total derivatives market trading volume in 2020 will grow to more than twice the spot trading volume,” they said, predicting that the competition in the derivatives products will be more intense, giving each exchange the opportunity to get more investors. However, the first to reduce fees or launch a fixed rate exchange “will be favored by the [institutional investors]” as now it's still too expensive for them. Among the 12 derivatives exchanges studied by TokenInsight, 27 types of cryptocurrency futures contracts were listed. But the structure of the trading fees on cryptocurrency futures contracts “is obviously designed for retail investors,” says the report, providing a comparison. According to Amber Song, an analyst at TokenInsight, exchanges might offer a special fee for institutions, while a tiered fee structure would remain. For example, in October cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Pro, operated by major U.S.-based crypto company Coinbase, increased fees for lower-volume customers and reduced fees for high-volume customers. ""I  think that there is going to be significant consolidation of crypto derivatives in 2020. I also think that there will be increased usage of new types of derivatives--starting with options but quickly including tokenized trades,"" Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX, co-owned by Binance, was quoted as saying in the report. He also predicts that this year, we'll see a ""small increase in derivatives markets--maybe  reaching  15-20b/day of volume."" ""I'd guess that the number of traders will increase but only slightly as well and that the number of significant venues will probably decrease as the industry consolidates,"" the CEO added.Meanwhile, Hopex Derivatives Exchange CMO, Jenny Zhang, said that “In 2020, options trading will still be in its infancy” due to technical barriers and operating costs among other reasons. “The exchanges that complete the layout of futures trading in 2019 may begin to deploy options trading in 2020, occupying this undeveloped fertile land earlier, but this is just the beginning,” she was quoted as saying in the report.

","It's no secret that rival blockchain networks, or to be more precise, the people behind the projects, don't like each other. The Bitcoin community rags on Ethereum, while the EOS community rags on Tron, and so on, in a seemingly endless chain of barbs, criticisms and mockery.","But does the war of words between cryptos ever spill over into something more aggressive and destructive? Possibly, if previous attacks on the likes of Verge and IOTA were the responsibility of rival developers, rather than random hackers.And according to some commentators within the wider crypto community, the future could bear witness to a rise in rival chains attacking each other in one way or another. In an already fractious climate, this is likely to only make relations between cryptos even colder, and could even damage the future viability of some projects.However, developers working with specific blockchains believe that such a scenario is unlikely. Yes, hackers who think they can make some money by attacking a network might attempt to do so, but rivalry alone isn't enough to motivate developers into doing the same.First, is there any evidence that one network has somehow attacked a rival? Well, back in July 2018, an Ethereum developer accused members of the EOS community of a Sybil attack, which in this case saw the Ethereum blockchain being spammed with airdrops of tokens with no value, thereby inflating the price of the gas needed to process transactions.Obviously, no one associated with EOS accepted this charge, but the fact that around USD 2 million was spent to send the worthless tokens indicates that whoever was behind the attack had deeper pockets than the average user.Other evidence of rival attacks is scarce, although numerous breaches of various networks have taken place over recent months and years. There was a series of attacks against Verge  in 2018, the theft of IOTA tokens (also 2018), as well as an ""intentional attack"" Ethereum suffered this past New Year's Eve.Nothing suggests that such attacks were the work of anyone other than one or two perpetrators. However, given that you'd probably have to already have experience with blockchain to pull off such crimes, you could potentially stretch the meaning of 'rival attack' to incorporate them, since they were likely committed by people 'aligned' with another project.As for the future, some figures within the industry believe that rival cryptocurrencies will increasingly attack each other's chains in the coming years.In fact, around the same time that Ethereum was undergoing its latest attack, the co-founder of Delphi Digital, Tom Shaughnessy, was predicting just such a rise.$ETH vs $DOT will be the biggest fight if I had to guess. Felt this way for a long timeHe isn't the only one. Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood wrote a recent article predicting the arrival of ""blockchain wars,"" as competing networks increasingly strive to exploit bugs and weaknesses in the architecture of rival chains.""Over time, governance-backed, economically-incentivized positive action will turn into outwardly-directed negative action against competitors,"" he wrote. ""Initially, it will be the dumb networks that are eliminated. Blockchain 'wars' will follow.""Despite these warnings, a variety of developers believe that fears of a rise in rival attacks are mostly unfounded.""Rivalry is not a motivation for an attack,"" argues Bitcoin Core developer Nicolas Dorier, speaking to Cryptonews.com. ""Motivation for an attack is either making money (stealing or via shorting the market before carrying out the attack) or for reputation gain for a security researcher.""Ethereum developer Nina Breznik agrees with Dorier's view that rivals won't be motivated by rivalry alone to attack another cryptocurrency. Asked by Cryptonews.com as to whether we're likely to witness an increase this year, she replies, ""Verbal attacks - yes, a lot. Otherwise, I don't know.""Breznik adds that weâ€™ve been given a distorted view of how much rival chains 'hate' each other, because of how they need to spend so much time promoting themselves over their competitors.""Verbal attacks are common, it's marketing rhetoric and everyone wants to pull people into their story/community,"" she explains.""But I don't know about attacks on the infrastructure. I was working on an in-browser tool for writing and searching solidity source code and all the apps we've built are server-less, so we made sure there is nothing to attack.""Another Bitcoin Core developer, Bryan Bishop, chides Cryptonews.com for asking whether rival chains will increasingly attack each other. ""I think those are the wrong questions,"" he replies.That said, he does warn that projects and their development communities need to be careful when it comes to bugs in code, which could invite attacks if they're made known to the wrong people.""The biggest concern is the management of sensitive information regarding vulnerabilities,"" he says.""The disclosure of these vulnerabilities is very important, but not at the expense of compromising existing users. It's often the case that security holes need to be fixed quietly and are only announced later.""In other words, we may continue to see the odd network attacked as a result of its own vulnerabilities. But as for whether 2020 will be characterized by â€˜blockchain wars,â€™ you probably shouldnâ€™t hold your breath."

","The world is today mourning the death of Kobe Bryant, the American basketball legend and retired NBA star. What many might not know is that he also paid a visit to the Cryptoverse.","Bryant, a.k.a. Black Mamba, died in a tragic accident on Sunday in a helicopter crash in California at age of 41. His daughter Gianna and seven more people were killed as well. According to the New York Times, the authorities have not yet been able to recover the bodies due to the rough terrain of the crash site, and it will take several days to do so.Bryant had a small connection to the world of crypto and blockchain. In November 2018, the Tron Foundation made headlines when it announced that ""Kobe Bryant, CEO and President of Kobe Inc and NBA legend, will be attending Tron's first international conference in San Francisco as a Special Guest to share his vision on entrepreneurship."" His role at the two-day NiTRON Event was to share his knowledge and life experience with entrepreneurs and leaders. The response to this news was mixed, with some people believing it'll promote both Tron and cryptocurrencies in general, and others wondering if he was going there just for a paycheck. ""It was amazing to talk about our shared values. Let’s continue to wake up every day doing the things we love,"" said Tron's Justin Sun following the event.Tron Foundation has expressed their condolences and stated that the upcoming niTROn Summit, planned to be held from February 29 through March 1 in Seoul, will be dedicated to Black Mamba.Kobe Bryant, 41, the legendary basketball star who spent 20 years with the LA Lakers, passed away today.Kobe is a member of the TRON Family. As such, we will be dedicating @niTROnSummit's festivities to his legendary life & legacy.Please share your favorite Kobe memories here pic.twitter.com/Ra8IzFBpbcJustin Sun further tweeted alongside a photo of him and Bryant: ""Kobe, was great to have met you in niTROn 2019. Mtg you was one of my life's greatest honor & privilege, I'll forever remember us on stage discussing the future of blockchain. We'll have a moment of silence in your honor during niTROn 2020. R.I.P.""While many see this as a respectful act, not everybody in the Cryptoverse is convinced that this is an honest expression of condolences, but rather a marketing ploy. For example, Dovey Wan, Partner at crypto investment firm Primitive Ventures, called Sun ""a total psychopath, period."" (Learn more: Ex-BitTorrent Staff Allege Violence at Tron from Boss Justin Sun)This is completely intolerable for using a legend’s tragic death as a marketing gimmick 🤮🤮🤮Meanwhile, Bryant had been involved in a number of different businesses, projects and endorsement deals throughout his career, and his support was often a major wind in the back and validation for a project or business. It's not surprising that he was involved in projects outside his basketball career as he had said in an interview that he'd rather be known for the venture investing than for basketball. The same article states that Bryant and entrepreneur and former Web.com CEO, Jeff Stibel had launched a USD 100 million investment fund called Bryant Stibel back in 2013. The company now has more than USD 2 billion in assets, reports CNN Business, and has been focused on investments in many technology, media and data companies, such as the famous game Fortnite creator Epic Games (that enabled Monero pay at its store ‘by accident’ in 2019), digital payment company Klarna and household products firm The Honest Company, and it also claims a number of successful exits, including Dell and Alibaba. Bryant invested in the gaming industry to support the technology behind it, which is a field of growth for crypto and blockchain, and he likely would've come more in contact with them in the future. Speaking of Alibaba, Bryant Stibel had invested in Alibaba, but also Bryant himself worked with Alibaba Group in 2015 to release the basketball star's documentary ""Kobe Bryant's Muse,"" and he had a strong relationship with former CEO, Jack Ma. As reported, Ma is a known Bitcoin  skeptic, but he's a believer and an investor in blockchain-based projects. For example, his Ant Financial launched blockchain-based money transfers between Hong Kong and the Philippines, and he believes that impact of blockchain on people and society will be “greater than we can ever imagine.” Meanwhile, in early January, collectibles company Panini America announced that the launch of officially licensed blockchain-based trading cards, featuring famous athletes including Kobe Bryant."

","Everybody seems to be talking about cryptocurrency staking nowadays. As it continues to grow in popularity, exchanges all over the world seem to be lining up to offer their customers staking services – with no shortage of takers among their clientele.","Indeed, Mirko Schmiedl, CEO of StakingRewards.com says that a staking revolution is in the cards, telling Cryptonews,“The staking market will explode. More financial products featuring integrated staking will be created.”But Schmiedl admits that staking is easily “misunderstood.”So if you are one of the many people out there who have never really quite got to grips with staking – or have trouble understanding what it is, here is a basic guide to explain how it works plus a few pointers that will help you get started if you decide to begin staking.Staking refers to “locking up” a network’s digital asset in order to improve the efficacy of a blockchain network. This locking away of funds is what gives the action its name, as participants must first put up a “stake.”In exchange for staking funds and helping to secure the network, participants are often allowed to receive a share of the block rewards. Blockchain network operators typically use staking in one of two ways. The first is to leverage it as a consensus mechanism. Blockchain networks require a tool that allows their participants to agree on the final state of the ledger and coordinate their actions in a decentralized manner.This consensus mechanism is often called proof-of-stake (PoS). In contrast to proof-of-work (PoW), which involves using computational power to solve complex mathematical equations, PoS requires participants to put down a minimum amount of funds to allow a new block to be added to the ledger.Participants in this sort of initiative are called validators. In exchange for their efforts in verifying the veracity of transactions, validators receive block rewards, similar to PoW, when miners get, e.g., bitcoin.PoS first took place on the Peercoin network.Peercoin was created by Sunny King and Scott Nadal, and started out as a hybrid blockchain platform, leveraging both PoS and PoW. The network eventually phased out PoW and currently only leverages PoS. Staking as a consensus mechanism began to attract a significant amount of attention from the crypto sector when it was revealed that Ethereum was working towards transitioning from its PoW consensus mechanism to PoS.When Ethereum 2.0 finally launches, the Ethereum network will become completely reliant on PoS.The second scenario whereby staking is leveraged is in masternodes.Masternodes are specialized nodes that allow a blockchain network to introduce new features into its architecture.Masternodes made their debut in the Dash ecosystem, where they were used to support private transactions.Users who put up 1,000 Dash tokens earned the right to run nodes that had more responsibilities. As a payoff, masternode operators were entitled to greater rewards.Dash masternodes were such a hit that a number of rival blockchain networks began emulating their success.The use of staking as a consensus mechanism has been lauded by many within the cryptocurrency industry thanks to a number of factors. Firstly, proof-of-stake is energy efficient. It does not require computational power to solve mathematical equations. As a result, PoS networks only consume a small percentage of the energy consumed by an energy-guzzling PoW blockchain platform. In today’s increasingly eco-conscious world, this is a marked advantage.Secondly, supporters of the PoS claim that this mechanism is more secure than other consensus mechanisms, particularly PoW. A number of smaller blockchains that employ PoW have fallen victim to 51% attacks. This is possible in PoW because consensus is created through a collection of computational power. As such, if the bad actor in question can successfully deploy more hash power than the majority of the hash rate, they can seize control of the network. (However, in case of Bitcoin, one hour of an attack on this network would cost more than USD 800,000, according to crypto51.app, and would basically just allow double spending, while it doesn't allow the attacker to steal everyone's coins.)With PoS, though, it works differently. This is due to the prohibitively large amounts of funds that a raider would need to put up as a stake in order to successfully launch a 51% attack.Moreover, the attacker would be affecting the value of their own holdings – effectively wiping out the entire point of conducting a 51% attack.As Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explains in a blog post,“The ‘one-sentence philosophy’ of proof-of-stake is not ‘security comes from burning energy’, but rather ‘security comes from putting up economic value-at-loss.’”(However, the PoW vs. PoS debate never ends. Learn more: Vitalik Buterin vs. Proof of Work Camp)For masternodes, staking is beneficial as it allows blockchain networks to introduce new characteristics without executing complex architectural overhauls.The previously mentioned Dash network, for example, has introduced masternodes to support private transactions. And another blockchain network, Syscoin, uses masternodes to buoy its decentralized marketplace.Individuals who choose to participate in the staking economy – whether through a PoS network or through masternodes – usually do so for economic reasons. Contrary to popular belief, staking is anything but passive. Unlike HODLing, staking lets you generate a profit from funds that would otherwise likely be sitting dormant.Additionally, proponents of staking consider it to be a safe way to earn income from cryptocurrency holdings.Tokens put up as a stake never leave the control of their owner, unlike a range of other profit-raising activities. Moreover, it is generally easy to withdraw your staking funds if and when you need them.Schmiedl, himself the founder of a staking analytics platform, is naturally bullish about the future outlook of the staking industry.He tells Cryptonews.com,“The staking market will explode in the coming years, since every newly-launched blockchain is based on Proof-of-Stake and layer-2 is no exception. We will see more and more financial products being created with integrated staking and the friction will go down for retail investors who want to keep their custody and liquidity.”Like everything in life, staking also has its drawbacks.For one, staking rewards are typically paid out in the native token of the blockchain network in question. As such, individuals looking to turn a profit through the token need to assess the ecosystem as a whole, instead of just looking at the projected return-on-investment (ROI) of a staking coin.In other words, if the ROI of a stakeable coin is very high but the coin has very low market capitalization and trading volumes, it would probably better to avoid it – as it will be hard to cash in on the tokens you have earned without seriously disrupting the market. Moreover, if the cryptocurrency you are staking does not manage to increase in value or at least maintain its value, you will likely lose money. That is because the “interest” earned in the form of new tokens may not compensate for the drop in market value.It pays to be picky, in other words.Schmiedl says of the potential risks,“Staking is still misunderstood by many users. It is important to look at the risk-to-reward ratio of participation. Each asset bears many reward options.”If you manage to pick the right token, staking can be an excellent way to earn investment income. However, just like any type of investment, risks abound, knowledge is king – and fools rush in where angels fear to tread.

","On January 15, Chief District Judge Phyllis Hamilton of the Northern District of California heard Ripple Lab’s  case for dismissing a class action and now the company's fate, as well as that of the ""half a trillion XRP market"", is in her hands. ","The judge now needs to make a decision on whether the class action continues, and it’s all likely tied to how she interprets the already “hazy” definitions of securities and public offerings, reports Law.com. However, Ripple argued in the motion that the continuation of the case “would not only threaten to eliminate XRP’s utility as a currency, but it would upend and threaten to destroy the established XRP market more broadly — a market involving over USD 500 billion in trading over the last two years."" The company also stressed that this might wipe out ""the value held by the alleged thousands of individual XRP holders around the world (many of whom no doubt disagree with Plaintiff’s claim that XRP is a security)"" and ""would unfairly disrupt the long-settled expectations of other XRP market participants, such as exchanges, market makers, custody providers and others.""Meanwhile, lead plaintiff Bradley Sostack’s counsel, Oleg Elkhunovich, said the complaint contains no facts and that Ripple made no arguments about the time of the first public offering. He noted that there is an error in the filing that claims a USD 700,000 settlement with the federal government that Ripple Labs made in 2015 for selling XRP without authorization acknowledged that the company did offer the token to the “general public.”“You’re suggesting that I rely on what you say instead of what you pled because it’s inaccurate?” Hamilton is quoted by Law.com as saying, adding: “Given how careful you’re being about the characterization of sales to the public, it’s the essence of your argument, why did you include that in your complaint?” Elkhunovich confirmed the mistake.The judge also asked Ripple’s attorney Damien Marshall if Ripple Labs was going with the argument that “the few times public offering is used in the complaint” is enough to show that there was a public offering, to which Marshall replied that “it’s plaintiffs’ burden to show that repose doesn’t apply in pleadings.” He added that they have to be held to allegations in the complaint that there were public sales and billions in circulation by 2015, and that all the given facts meet the definition of a genuine offer to the public. Elkhunovich argued that an offering to the public is not enough, and that “it has to be the type of bona fide public offering that would put the public on notice,” the article says.Another dispute is over securities. “Counsel admitted to classifying as a security for the purposes of this motion, only for purposes of this motion, they are not arguing XRP is not a security,” Elkhunovich is quoted as saying. “Believe it, if this case proceeds that will be one of the key issues that will be hotly disputed.” As a reminder, investors sued Ripple and its executives back in 2018, claiming that they were persuaded by the company to purchase XRP, resulting in loss of money, that the company violated U.S. securities laws by selling XRP, and that XRP should be declared a security. However, Ripple has argued that the complaint filing exceeds a three-year deadline, hence the case should be dismissed. Sostack’s attorneys said  that this argument “is a twisted application” of the time limit that would undermine the law’s purpose of protecting investors from fraud. In the meantime, the chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Heath Tarbert, said in a recent interview that the status of XRP as a security or commodity is still unclear, and that they’ve been working closely with the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) on this issue.Furthermore, Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel at Compound Finance, says that, even if Ripple were to win the motion to dismiss and the entire class action were thrown out, it wouldn’t mean much for XRP. “The big & interesting question is if XRP was (or is) a security. Ripple's motion didn't ask that question, so dismissal won't answer it — just defer it to another day,” he writes. He added that Ripple’s approach seems effective and industry standard, but also that the defense is working to advance Ripple’s best interests, not those of XRP holders.Yes, absolutely true and well said. I suspect that's the logic behind Ripple's entire litigation strategy, which so far has been ""delay, delay, delay.""XRP is currently (11:29 UTC) trading at USD 0.225. It fell almost 5% in 24 hours, but appreciated more than 10% in the past seven days. The price is down 32% in a year."

",Uzbekistan’s president has produced a draft decree that will see tax authorities in the country waive taxes on cryptocurrency trading and transactions – for both Uzbeks and non-nationals living in the country.,"As previously reported, the government has been keen to implement the new measures – as well as new mining regulations – since the turn of the year.However, according to a document posted on the government’s official website, the draft decree could be implemented as early as February, with a consultation period set to end at the end of this month.The decree is entitled “Measures for the further development of the circulation of [cryptocurrencies] in Uzbekistan.”Under the terms of the decree, crypto transactions would also be free from the kind of restrictions usually placed on foreign currencies.The decree also contains further details of a proposed national “mining pool,” which will allow miners to make use of discounted electricity rates. Membership of the mining pool will be mandatory, and it will require miners to “combine their hardware capacities.”The government will also reserve the right to conduct an emergency shutdown of all mining operations in emergency situations.Industrial mining firms will be required to register with a regulator and obtain a license to provide “transparency,” the decree’s authors write.The decree also includes proposals that would see the government create what it calls a “Blockchain Valley” – a regulatory sandbox for companies looking to “introduce blockchain technology and circulate [cryptocurrencies].”Emurgo, the venture arm of Cardano, is also reportedly in talks with the government in what it calls a bid “to lead the development of a legal framework for security token offerings (STOs) and exchanges (STXs) in Uzbekistan.”Meanwhile, the newly opened Uzbekistan Cryptocurrency Exchange (UZNex) is the first licensed crypto exchange to open in the Turkestan region, reports Regnum. The Uzbekistani government gave its blessing to the new platform, as part of a new set of pro-crypto measures. The media outlet states that a number of blockchain departments are also set to open at some of the country’s leading universities."

January 09, 2020
","The former CEO of the now-defunct exchange Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles, has made a move in an attempt to shut down the class action lawsuit against him filed by ex-Mt. Gox customer, Gregory Greene. ","Greene filed the original complaint against Karpeles in Illinois in 2014, claiming that the ex-CEO (who ran it since 2011) is responsible for the loss customers suffered in the exchange’s collapse that year. He’s the only plaintiff left now.According to the memorandum filed on January 8, Karpeles is now arguing that the plaintiff failed to prove his case and that he has no evidence to support the claims of conversion, negligence and consumer fraud. He also argues that Greene has contradicted his claims that the customers were tricked about the safety of the assets on the exchange.“Rather than withdrawing claims based on allegations that Mr. Greene readily admitted in subsequent discovery were not true or unsupported,” said Karpeles in the introduction, “Mr. Greene doggedly pursued these claims.” He asked for summary judgment on all the claims, saying: “The time has come to end this litigation in its entirety.”Karpeles denied that he converted his or anyone else’s bitcoin (BTC) and fiat currency stored on Mt. Gox. He said Greene’s three evidence to support the claim are irrelevant, inadmissible, or speculative, and that no fact witnesses were identified or expert testimonies on technical issues provide. “Because of the absence of evidence to support the plaintiff’s case regarding the supposed conversion by Mr. Karpeles, Mr. Karpeles is entitled to summary judgment on Count I,” the memorandum says.Again, Karpeles claims that Greene has no evidence to support a claim for negligence or the breach of duty, but also that the claim is barred by Illinois’ economic loss doctrine. To prove the negligence, a plaintiff must establish the existence of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff, under Illinois law, as well as a breach of that duty, and an injury caused by it – and Karpeles says that this wasn’t done. He adds that there is no separately created legal duty that Mt. Gox or himself owed to Greene as recognized by Illinois law, and that it certainly didn’t exist in 2014, arguing that this is the type of business transaction that falls into contractual principles rather than negligence and that, hence, Greene has no legal basis for the claims.“Without “the existence of a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff,” Mr. Greene cannot sustain his claim for negligence, there is no genuine issue of material fact, and summary judgment is proper in Mr. Karpeles’ favor on Count II for this reason alone,” the memorandum says.Regarding the state-law consumer fraud claim, Karpeles writes: “Mr. Greene’s admissions, actions and repeated disavowals of his own assertions filed in pleadings in this Court, including the Complaint, eviscerate his Consumer Fraud Act claim.” He says that Greene’s own testimony during the discovery process undercuts his statement that he opened an account at Mt. Gox as a result of deception about the safety and stability of Mt. Gox.“Mr. Greene does not remember and cannot identify what he looked at before opening his Mt. Gox account,” says the memorandum. “Mr. Greene does not remember looking at any specific portion of the Terms of Use, and cannot identify any statement in it. “ Greene “readily admits” that he knows no website or bitcoin exchange is 100% secure, and that he signed up for an Mt. Gox account without seeing any information regarding its security, Karpeles lawyers say.Karpeles claims that Greene already started trying to withdraw his BTC in November 2013, months before its collapse, so that even if there were a cover-up of stolen funds as Greene claims, it wouldn’t have affected his decision.“The undisputed facts demonstrate Mr. Greene’s ICFA claim is entirely unfounded, as he has contradicted his own allegations, many of which should have been withdrawn long ago. Because Mr. Green cannot show many of the required elements of an ICFA claim, Mr. Karpeles is entitled to summary judgment on Count III,” the memorandum says.As reported, in March 2019, Karpeles was found guilty by the Tokyo District Court for tampering with the exchange’s financial records, as well as mixing his personal finances with those of the exchange. However, the court dismissed the embezzlement charges that had also been raised against Karpeles, saying he “acted without ill intent” and giving him a 2 1/2 year “suspended sentence,” which does not need to be served unless another crime is committed within four years.As a reminder, the exchange Mt. Gox filed for liquidation in April 2014, claiming it was hacked and that approximately BTC 850,000 belonging to customers and the company were missing, an amount valued at more than USD 450 million at the time. However, a few weeks later, around 200,000 were somehow found. Last November, we discussed the mystery of the stolen bitcoins."

Mordor Intelligence did not respond to our request for comment.Meanwhile, regarding the competition within the market, the report says that it is moderately fragmented and that it consists of several global and regional players, with the key players including Ledger SAS, the manufacturer of the Ledger wallet, and SatoshiLabs SRO (Trezor). It poses low barriers to entry for new players, so several newcomers have managed to gain traction by offering products that have many features at competitive prices. ""The market studied is characterized by increasing levels of product penetration, moderate/high product differentiation, and high levels of competition,"" the report claims, adding that the concentration ratio ""is expected to record robust growth over the forecast period,"" partly thanks ""to the lucrative opportunity in the market with high profits."" Meanwhile, as reported, major research and advisory company Gartner said that both hardware and software wallets have reached their peaks of inflated expectations and are about to enter the 'Trough of Disillusionment,' but that the future seems bright.On the other hand, market research company P&S Intelligence said in their recent report  that the global blockchain devices market share was valued at USD 300 million in 2019 and that it's expected to reach USD 23.5 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 48.7% during the forecast period (2020–2030). This is a 7,733% rise. This report states, however, that crypto hardware wallets held the largest market share in 2019, but that crypto automated teller machines (ATMs) are expected to register fastest growth rate of 55% during the forecast period. Meanwhile, we also reported  back in September that market research firm MarketsandMarkets believed at the time that we are in for a blockchain device boom, finding that the blockchain devices market is expected to grow from USD 218 million in 2019 to USD 1.285 billion by 2024 (a 498.4% rise), at a CAGR of 42.5% in this time period.Lastly, check out how to store crypto safely, how to turn your old smartphone into an Ethereum Hardware wallet, these six alternative hardware wallets, and also Andreas M.

",The Communist Party of China (CPC) wants high ranking government staff to learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain – and has approved the release of a new book specially designed for its cadres.,"The 200-page book was published in November last year and is named Digital Currency: A Reader for Cadres, and has been released by the publishing arm of the Chinese state-run media outlet People’s Daily. It has been priced at USD 3.9, and is now available for purchase online.The book comprises 23 essays penned by experts from the central People's Bank of China (PBoC). Authors address topics ranging from the basics of cryptocurrency to the finer details of blockchain technology, and crypto and blockchain’s influence on finance and the global monetary system, per a Bloomberg report.The authors boldly declare, on the textbook’s cover, “Digital currency is inevitable in the course of history”, and state that the book was published to “help Party cadres deepen their understanding” of cryptocurrencies.The paper’s coverage of China’s increasingly complex blockchain and cryptocurrency policy has reflected the party’s often-confusing approach to the matter.In an editorial published on December 18, the People’s Daily stated (via China Daily, its English-language arm),“China's blockchain market is becoming more attractive than ever to foreign investors, with the industry receiving a significant boost from the central government.” The same author noted that Beijing “has implemented regulations in recent years to ban technologies such as initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges. Its support for blockchain, as well as artificial intelligence, was highlighted in a [2016-20 plan] for national development.”Chinese authorities still perceive cryptocurrencies as a threat to state-controlled centralized finance, but are keen on utilizing blockchain technology to steal a march on international rivals. The PBoC is reportedly preparing to test its much-vaunted digital yuan in Suzhou and Shenzhen, with an “imminent” pilot launch planned."

","How can you grow your blockchain project to a million users by the end of 2020, and five million by the end of 2022? It’s simple, says CEO of blockchain startup Business Club Tim Odermatt: with intense campaigning, along with their solutions, success is inevitable. “We are first company ever on the market to combine debit cards issuing cryptocurrency wallet with a social network, all based on our blockchain and supported by our own cryptocurrency,” he says. Sure, millions of users within such a short timeframe may sound hard to achieve, but Odermatt believes that “the possibilities are unlimited, and our goals are within our reach.” By offering an Active Wallet that generates passive income for their native Business Club Token (BCT), which supply is capped at 720 million tokens, the project is currently working to obtain a license from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a financial regulatory body in the United Kingdom, as well as from the Electronic Money Institutions (EMI) in Malta. This will pave the way for them to start issuing VISA payment cards by the third quarter of the coming year. While intense campaigning may do the trick for getting people on board, once you read up on the project, you might want to help them along yourself. The Business Club has a seven-level commission system, increasing your profits whenever you recommend the Active Wallets system to other people. The more people you have on your downline, the more passive income you’re generating. This also means there are six different account tiers you can achieve on the platform according to the state of your downline, and the rewards are increasing amounts of team bonuses, from 5% to 25%. During pre-launch mode, you will need a referring number to register: 161128601154If you’re afraid you won’t be able to participate, fear not: Odermatt says that the project has been global from its very inception, and the website is available in 17 different languages. Although the launch is mostly aimed at EU and Asian countries, “we have US strong kickstarter prepared for 2020,” he explains. If you’re looking for a blockchain-based ecosystem that is tailored towards businesses and success-oriented individuals alike, Business Club is the solution for you. With blockchain guaranteeing security, immutability and transparency in terms of transactions, once you open an Active Wallet through the project, you will automatically gain access to your social network profile that you can use to get in touch with similarly-minded people and grow your network by talking to them through a fully encrypted chat. The BCT coin powering the infrastructure will be available for purchase through the project’s Active Wallet directly, as it is minted through every purchase instead of on a schedule. Once the supply reaches its cap of 720 million tokens, minting will stop, and after a two-week period it will go live on both the integrated and external exchanges. The coin will be worth one US dollar at launch, but the team estimates manyfold growth over time, in part thanks to the limited supply, even to the point that they expect BCT to enter the top 20 coins by market capitalization. BCT transactions won’t leave you destitute: at a transaction fee of 0.25% which is set to drop to 0.005% once the supply cap is reached, you’ll be free to transfer funds as much as you want to. Stay tuned for more information so you can get in on the fun before the rush starts!Visit Business Club to register!

","On Tuesday, XRP, the native token of the Ripple Ledger and the third most valuable coin by market capitalization, is correcting its gains after a strong rally on Monday, prompted by positive news. ","At pixel time (10:07 UTC), XRP trades at c. USD 0.215 after almost touching USD 0.225 earlier today (UTC time). The price is still up by more than 4% in the past 24 hours and by 11.5% in a week, trimming its monthly losses to 4.6%. The coin is the best performer among the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization today.XRP price chart:XRP started its rally on Monday, just right before major crypto exchange Binance announced the launch of XRP/USDT Perpetual Futures with up-to 75X leverage, prompting speculations about a possible insider trading. In either case, the derivative product is estimated to expand the XRP market. Also, major money transfer company MoneyGram, co-owned by Ripple, announced “record-breaking” online transaction growth during the holiday shopping season from its MoneyGram-branded online platforms: However, the company did not provide any other numbers. As reported in December, while MoneyGram has already pushed more than USD 100 million through Ripple's platform, the blockchain-based startup's capability to lure more clients will be crucial to the partnership’s future, according to Alex Holmes, CEO and Chairman of MoneyGram.Meanwhile, in related news from last week, South Korean telecoms giant SK is set to debut a new blockchain-powered donations platform it has developed using Ripple technology."

","Binance has revealed that it is “preparing to launch trading services for users in Japan” – and is currently in advanced talks with the operator of Yahoo Japan, which runs a licensed cryptocurrency exchange in the country.","In an official post, Binance stated that it has “entered into a strategic partnership discussion” with Z Corporation, and the holding company Z Holdings Corporation, which runs Yahoo Japan, one of the country’s biggest search engines and internet platforms.The company began life as a partnership between America’s Yahoo and Japanese business giant SoftBank, which holds a 48% stake in Yahoo Japan. The American company is no longer associated with Yahoo Japan. And Yahoo Japan, in turn, owns a controlling stake in the recently rebranded TaoTao exchange.The exchange, formerly known as BitARG, was one of the first to receive an operating license from the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA). The regulator has a notoriously strict compliance policy, and an off-putting application backlog.As such, many Japanese companies have sought to buy up smaller already-licensed exchanges.Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to talk up the partnership deal, writing,“Many non-Japanese may not understand the significance of this. […] Couldn't ask for a better partner than TaoTao in Japan.”The partnership could potentially throw the Japanese crypto world wide open.Softbank already has a number of irons in the blockchain and cryptocurrency fire, and has made significant blockchain-related investments in the past few years. Yahoo Japan has integrated Ripple's MoneyTap technology into its PayPay mobile-based e-pay solution.And readers may recall that a deal-in-principle is still on the table for Yahoo Japan over a possible merger with Line, Japan’s biggest chat app. Line’s biggest shareholder is Naver, a South Korean internet giant. Line operates a number of crypto exchanges, including an FSA-licensed trading platform in Japan.The move could well be part of a concerted Binance effort to break into the lucrative East Asian market. Rival exchange Huobi has already established fast-growing exchanges in both Seoul and Tokyo. Last year, Binance struck a partnership with a subsidiary of South Korea’s Kakao, the operator of the Klaytn blockchain platform.Binance has previously been warned off by the FSA, which specifies that even overseas-based exchanges may not actively target Japanese customers without an operating permit. As reported, the company said yesterday that Binance.com will be phasing out the provision of services to Japanese residents and will gradually restrict transactions for them.And per Business Korea, Binance has now made an unspecified investment in South Korean stablecoin issuer and blockchain startup BXB.The media outlet quotes Binance as stating,“We are drawing up a long-term plan to lead the South Korean cryptocurrency market.”At pixel time, binance coin (BNB), the native token of the exchange, trades at c. USD 18 and is up 9% in a day and  27% in a week."

","Line, one of Asia’s biggest chat apps, is set to debut its own digital token in Japan on Bitmax, its own crypto exchange.","Per a number of Japanese media outlets, including Coin Post, the company made its announcement via its blockchain and cryptocurrency subsidiary LVC – and is aiming for a rollout in April this year.The Link token first saw the light of day in 2018 when it was listed by a Singapore-based affiliate company, and has been made available on Line-run cryptocurrency exchanges elsewhere in Asia.However, Line has been particularly eager to distribute the token in Japan, where it claims to have 82 million active daily users. Moreover, the company last year won a license to operate Bitmax in the country from the regulatory Financial Securities Agency, and has already integrated it with its chat app interface.The company is hoping to integrate Link with its chat app operations – and could look to distribute the token in rewards programs aligned with its Line chat app operations.Bitmax currently handles five major cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum.The company was founded by South Korean web giant Naver, which owns a 73% stake in Line.Another South Korean chat app, KakaoTalk (owned by the Kakao Group) has also talked of listing its Klay token on Asian crypto exchanges.Analysts have claimed Line and Kakao are already a step ahead of the likes of Facebook and Telegram – rival social media platforms whose own token launch plans have hit regulatory hurdles in Europe and North America.Meanwhile, Naver finalized a deal in December to merge Line with SoftBank’s internet subsidiary Yahoo Japan to create a USD 30 billion tech giant that could better compete with global internet behemoths. As reported by Cryptonews.com in November 2019, this merger could create one of the biggest internet companies in Asia, while both parties have considerable cryptocurrency and blockchain interests."

","Kenyan market regulators should focus on creating an innovative regulatory framework instead of demonizing initial coin offerings (ICOs), which is an ""independent and viable way"" to raise capital, according to local market participants.","This week, the Capital Market Authority of Kenya (CMA) warned investors against participating in unregulated ICOs, adding that it has not yet approved any ICO. “The ongoing offerings are unregulated and speculative investments, with considerable risk to the investor,” they stressed, also referring to the warnings by the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) that ICO investors risk being defrauded.Andrew Langat of L-Pesa, a micro-lender with a presence in three African countries that conducted an ICO in late 2017, said that the regulator should not demonize ICOs but create a regulatory framework in order to weed bad actors out of the market. “The horse has already bolted, and there is little CMA’s directive can do now. To insist on applying the knowledge of conventional capital markets is to miss the whole point on why ICOs proved attractive to startup. The ultimate aim of CMA should be to treat ICOs as an independent and viable way to raise funds, and establish regulations for them to safeguard investor money,” Langat told Cryptonews.com.The same sentiment was shared by Michael Kimani, the Head of Business Development for Zippie, a platform for launching financial apps.“The fact that the CMA referred to another international organization shows that they lack original thought and have not internally worked on any framework. It also highlights the lack of capacity on the regulation or even the creation of frameworks to manage innovation,” he stressed.However, the warning by the CMA is not just an unsubstantiated statement. Authorities in Kenya, including the CMA, are investigating Isaac Muthui, a clergyman, who conducted an ICO through the ChurchBlaze Group Limited in 2017. Muthui is accused of defrauding over 11,000 Kenyans of USD 27 million after “irregularly collecting funds” from investors by selling Nurucoin. “For many investors, the concept of an ICO is poorly understood. The idea that they (ICOs) offer a quick-rich path often leads to traps such as Nurucoin. Ultimately, the goal should be to inform potential investors that like any investment out there, not getting a return should be accepted as [a potential] investment outcome,” Langat commented.“Investors must first understand the utility of the coin before they invest in it,” Prof. Bitange Ndemo, the Chairman of Kenya’s Distributed Ledgers and Artificial Intelligence Taskforce and a former Permanent Secretary of Kenya’s Ministry of Information and Communication, told Cryptonews.com.The current regulatory environment in Kenya is pro-blockchain but maintains an anti-cryptocurrency stance. However, trading or holding cryptocurrencies is legal, despite they’re not recognized as legal tender."

",Once again the Swiss mountain resort welcomes one of the most diverse gatherings of people from across the world and across industries – both the elite and the fringe – coming together for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF). ,"Scheduled for January 21st through 24th, the forum’s celebrating its 50th rendition this year, and it’ll see a number of major world figures, both established and newcomers, such as the executive director of UNAIDS Winnie Byanyima, president of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde, president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, climate activist Greta Thunberg, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, U.S. President Donald Trump, and many more of the people who run the world. Each year has a different theme, and for 2020, it’s sustainable development or ""Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World"".That said, blockchain and crypto have been infiltrating the event at a rapid pace, though it’s questionable if the event considers it mainstream enough to include more of the industry specialists in the “main stage” discussions.

Zhan wrote in a letter published November on his WeChat social media account that he’ll return to Bitmain and “restore order” and “if someone wants war, we’ll give them war,” according to the report.As reported in October, Jihan Wu, who started Bitmain with Zhan six years ago, returned as the CEO of Bitmain, announcing that Zhan no longer holds any position at the Beijing-based company effective immediately. Moreover, Wu warned employees against taking further instructions from Zhan or attending any meetings he convenes, threatening staff with dismissal or criminal charges.According to various reports, a year ago, Zhan owned a 60% stake in Bitmain, while Wu and another co-founder Yuesheng Ge had c. 30%. However, according to Bloomberg, Wu and Zhan hold 21% and 37% of the company, respectively.Meanwhile, since the drama in October, Wu has announced a series of measures aimed strengthening positions of the company, including discounts, new line of mining hardware and new repair centers.

The committee chief stated,“Companies have said that they need this law and that they intend to actively use it. This gives me confidence that this year we will definitely adopt it.”Despite finding himself very much in the middle of the struggle between regulators and crypto-keen business interests, Aksakov appeared to rule out any lingering fears of a China-style crypto crackdown.He stated,“The hype [about cryptocurrencies] has passed, and everyone agrees that the blockchain has a future. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are interconnected. I think that [the Duma] will definitely adopt a law related to [cryptocurrencies] in the upcoming spring session.”He added that all parties were taking a “more relaxed attitude” toward crypto, although he added that he “cannot comment on what that legislation will look like now.”And it looks like even arch crypto-skeptics at the central bank may have softened their stance, with Aksakov stating,“There are a lot of qualified people who understand that progress cannot be stopped; that we just need appropriate regulations.”The Duma commission chairman added that Russia would also push ahead with plans to create a regulatory sandbox for blockchain and cryptocurrency projects.Aksakov said, “The sandbox will create a space for [companies] to test new financial and digital technology.”

And without a strong break-out through the 200-day moving average on decent trading volumes, it is unlikely that bulls will be able to keep the price up for long before sellers take over.As reported in January, Ripple announced that it had slashed sales of XRP tokens from its massive escrow fund in both Q3 and Q4 of last year. According to Ripple, total sales dropped 80% in Q4, to USD 13 million, after falling 74% in Q3. In addition, all exchange sales were halted during Q4, and were instead only conducted as over-the-counter (OTC) trades.Meanwhile, crypto tracking resource Whale Alert announced that XRP 500 million (USD 125 million) were unlocked from escrow by Ripple this past Saturday."

Currently, the supported cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum, while the support for Litecoin and XRP is planned with a software upgrade, ""or even more cryptocurrencies,"" says the website.As of yet, there is no information on the website about when it will be available and how much it'll cost.However, be aware - fingerprint sensors can reportedly be defeated by a 3D printer.This is the slogan of the aptly called 'Blockd' - ""the very first blockchain hack intervention"" service. What Blockd does trustlessly upon seeing an outgoing transaction from a user's address to an untrusted address, the website explains, is quickly replace the malicious transaction with one that sends those funds to safety. So, basically, it can't stop the transfer, but can rescue the funds. This is done by utilizing the so-called “Replace-By-Fee” protocol, which Robert M.C. Forster, Blockd's creator, explains in more detail in his blog post.But to prove that this really works, Forster has gone a step further and raised the stakes: he posted publicly on Reddit his Ethereum private key with 1 ETH in it, saying: ""First to send away my 1 Ether gets to keep it."" Indeed, the post provides all the relevant links for a person to go into the wallet and effortlessly transfer the funds, including the address, the private key, as well as the safety wallet that should receive the funds when somebody tries to take it.As he explains, what happens during the attack is that the attempted transaction is actually replaced with a higher fee paying transaction that was pre-signed by the owner, whereby the safety wallet receives the balance, adding: ""It works with Ethereum, ERC20s, and a few other blockchains, and we're also currently working on ways to possibly achieve the same goal to some extent on all blockchains."" However, if a hacker knows that the wallet is being protected by Blockd, hacks it nonetheless, knowing that a large percentage of it may be wasted, and worse still if they know the highest-priced blocker transaction, the current version of the service would not be able to protect the funds, the creator explains.Forster has edited the post, saying: ""I'm transferring the Ether out of the safety account (it hasn't somehow been stolen from there)."" Furthermore, Forster claims that Blockd doesn't have any control of anybody's private keys, but that making the code public is a good idea though. He said that they plan on adding a way for users to submit their own pre-signed transactions so no signing has to be done on Blockd's site and ""some sort of partnership with MEW or MyCrypto where users sign on their site and the [transaction] is sent to us would also be great to allow people to not have to trust us.""This was also a chance to promote the service as the post offers free sing-up until February 2 for people to give it a try.___Learn more:

",Ethereum 2.0 developers are sure that the Phase 0 of the network’s upgrade will be launched this year.,"Ethereum's major network upgrade, Ethereum 2.0 (a.k.a. Serenity), should be rolled out in phases, the first of which is Phase 0. The upgrade will bring, among other things, sharding, proof-of-stake (PoS), and a new virtual machine.On Wednesday, ETH 2.0 research team took to Reddit for their third AMA (ask me anything) session, where anybody interested in the network and in its recent development could participate to ask what they’re curious about.One of those questions is an often asked one – realistically, when could the Cryptoverse see Phase 0 rolled out? “I don't see a reality in which Phase 0 does not launch in 2020,” writes team member Danny Ryan. He explained that testnets are stronger with each week, and that audits are out, but also saying that such estimates depend on the specifications and on clients being deemed ready in third-party audits. “The rest depends [on] engineering concerns and stabilizing/optimizing in this last mile of work.”Nonetheless, the current Ethereum chain is strong on its own and will stay so for the next couple of years, he says, as client teams make “heroic” gains in optimizations and layer 2 constructions are being implemented. Also, “ETH 1 living inside of ETH 2 allows for native access to the scalable sharded data layer,” says Ryan.While Ryan finds that Phase 0 will “certainly” launch in 2020, his colleague Justin Drake is somewhat more cautious, positioning his confidence in this happening at 95%. Drake finds Ethereum’s 5th anniversary on July 30, as a good deadline, believing a launch is unlikely in Q1 and Q2, particularly if three clients are to be production-ready for launch. Some people seem to have gotten frustrated with the deadline for Phase 0 being pushed back again, but the developers explained that as certain changes had to be made to Phase 0 specs to accommodate Phase 1’s new direction, extending the deadline was necessary. “There are significant unknowns in the next couple of months,” and audits to be completed, so setting a firm date is not possible, says Ryan.As for the need for users’ ETH accounts to prepare for 2.0, Hsiao-Wei Wang said that no additional procedures need be done to ETH 1 accounts currently, while Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wrote that “if you are just holding ETH and want to keep your money, in all present proposals there is no risk from you going into a cave for five years. If you want to stake, then, of course, you have to actively deposit.”If ETH from Ethereum 1.0 isn’t transferred to Ethereum 2.0 voluntarily, nothing should happen to it. Ethereum 1.0 will continue to run as a shard of Ethereum 2.0, Dankrad Feist explains, and it might be phased out. But with this current plan, he doesn’t see a need for forced migration, so no ETH should be lost.Furthermore, Feist stated that currently there are no plans for a direct supply limit of ETH, as that could compromise security: if miners or validators are not paid fees, they will stop maintaining the chain, opening it to attacks. “Bitcoin may claim they have a supply limit, but there is no guarantee that once this is hit, the transactions would be enough to pay for the security that is still needed.” Fesit says that in Ethereum miners are paid rewards from ETH which will be created, “but almost all transaction fees will actually be burned. So it is possible that ETH supply actually shrinks in the future if adoption is high. However, if it is not, Ethereum should not compromise its security to have an artificial supply limit.”With a participant commenting that general adoption likely needs a really simple mobile wallet, Buterin replied that there is work already being done on that, posting a tweet showing the Ethereum infrastructure team Nimbus doing an experiment and running a mobile ETH 2.0 client for the first time.The #ethnimbus team is currently meeting in Brussels, playing with the first mobile #Eth2 testnet pic.twitter.com/X4wYql3WEZ As for interoperability with other chains, Drake said that the team has made an effort to facilitate this, and that two key technologies need for it are recursive SNARKs and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, in addition to the set of other features (SHA256, libp2p, BLS12-381 and WASM).On the question if other developing blockchain technologies like Parity’s Polkadot/Substrate are seen as competitors to ETH 2.0, Drake replied that many high-quality blockchain projects exist, (such as Algorand, Cardano, Cosmos, Dfinity, Filecoin,  Polkadot, Tezos), but that he believes that the ecosystem is very collaborative, so other blockchain projects are collaborators, rather than competitors. (Learn more: Are Attacks Between Rival Blockchains About to Rise?)Another person asked about the possibility of creating or supporting a project built on decentralization using Ethereum. Buterin replied that he’s interested in decentralized finance (DeFi), while DAI is doing well and getting a lot of adoption, but he also expressed interest in decentralized governance innovations in general, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) and DAICOs (decentralized models of initial coin offerings). He finds Ethereum Name Service to be the most promising non-financial app currently.Meanwhile, ETH is currently (11:25 UTC) trading at USD 209.20, having appreciated 7% in the past 24 hours and 20% in a week."

",Cardano (ADA) surged more than 8% over the past 24 hours (as of 11:00 UTC) following positive announcements.,"First, the token got the attention of many traders after a press release was sent out by Emurgo, the venture arm of Cardano. It said that Emurgo is setting up a “strategic task force” with the government of Uzbekistan “to lead the development of a legal framework for security token offerings (STOs) and exchanges (STXs) in the Republic of Uzbekistan.”Together with its partner KOBEA Group, Emurgo will also “advise on infrastructure for digital asset banking & exchange, and blockchain education units” in Uzbekistan, a Central Asian nation with a population of more than 30 million. Secondly, many Cardano followers were also pleased to hear Cardano’s co-founder Charles Hoskinson during a livestream on January 17 saying that he expects the blockchain to go through a planned hard fork in mid-February.According to Hoskinson, there is a “pretty high certainty” that the new protocol, known as an OBFT [Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerant] protocol, will be implemented as planned.“Looks like February — at pretty high certainty — we’re going to have the OBFT hard fork occur. We’re still talking to our exchange partners about that and we just want to make sure all the infrastructure is lined up for it, but infrastructure looks pretty good, so mid-February we anticipate the OBFT hard fork,” the Cardano co-founder said.Further, Hoskinson also revealed that the Daedalus Cardano wallet software is about to be integrated into the Ledger hardware wallet, which for many users is considered a significant advantage.At pixel time (11:00 UTC), ADA, ranked 11th by market capitalization, trades at c.

",European Commission executives have conceded that there is a pressing need for digital alternatives to conventional currency – but continue to condemn cryptocurrencies as “highly speculative.”,"In a panel session entitled “Creating a Credible and Trusted Digital Currency,” held at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President at the European Commission, stated that governments must “issue warnings to investors on the highly speculative nature” of cryptocurrencies.However, Dombrovskis conceded that Brussels also recognizes there are now financial “needs that are unaddressed, including fast, convenient and cheap cross-border payments.”The expert panel agreed that cryptocurrencies could help bring global small businesses into the international financial system, but claimed that public institutions still mistrust crypto-based finance.Nonetheless, central banks around the world are increasingly showing interest – an indication that they fear being left out of the emerging crypto sector.Dombrovskis opined,“It’s clear that if the European banking system […] does not address this demand, someone else will.”Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), stated,“We should ask ourselves what the real use cases are, and where we could add value.”Shanmugaratnam named three use cases:Digital tokens, he stated, “are either part of the solution or part of the problem.”Benoît Coeuré, Head of the Innovation Hub at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), said there had been a “noticeable” rise in interest in central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects from financial authorities around the world.Coeuré cited data from a report commissioned by the BIS that found that 80% of central banks said they were conducting CBDC-related research last year, a 10% rise from 2018 Coeuré said,“There is a strong focus on retail CBDC. When we ask different banks why they are doing it, the answers are different. Emerging market colleagues say it’s about financial inclusion, and it’s about reducing the use of cash, while advanced colleagues in advanced economies tell us it’s more about making sure we keep a link between citizens and the central bank as the use of cash dwindles.”David Marcus, the head of Facebook’s blockchain operations, said that the “big question” was whether banks focused on retail CBDC distribution were sufficiently “equipped and prepared to serve consumers and small businesses.”Dombrovskis, meanwhile, stated,“In Europe, we are concentrating on developing a pan-European instant payments system. And that’s where initiatives such as Libra come in, because they seem to be offering the same solution on an international scale.”Shanmugaratnam admitted that a hybrid financial system where public regulation played a behind-the-scenes role was a possibility.In a scenario like this, he stated, individual citizens “won’t see the public [bodies] running the system” – due to the fact that non-state payments actors will likely play such a dominant role.Meanwhile, today, the World Economic Forum announced the Global Consortium for Digital Currency Governance, which aims to bring together leading companies, financial institutions, government representatives, technical experts, academics, international organizations, NGOs and members of the Forum’s communities on a global level. This consortium will focus on solutions for a fragmented regulatory system.“Governance is the core pillar of any form of digital currency,” said Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England. “It is critical that any framework on digital currencies ensures security, efficiency and legitimacy of payments while ensuring fair and open competition.”

","A crypto exchange operator in Monterrey, Mexico, has launched an audacious crypto-powered bid to buy the country’s presidential aircraft for USD 138 million worth of tokens and a large swathe of land.","The move comes just days after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador floated the idea of raffling off his predecessor’s USD 130 million jet after the government’s efforts to sell the plane over the past year came to nothing. Per El Unviersal and El Sol de Mexico, Alfonso Jiménez, the CEO of crypto tech development firm Isatech, has asked the government to consider an offer that would see the company pay USD 138 million worth of its own Amero tokens, as well as handing over between 1,400 and 2,400 hectares of company-owned land in the state of Baja California Sur, including 10km of beachfront real estate.In exchange, the government would give his firm the keys to the president’s plane and two other government-owned aircraft.Isatech launched its crypto exchange token in summer last year. And earlier in 2018, it made yet more headlines when it paid USD 2.8 million worth of Amero for 1,400 hectares of Baja California Sur real estate, as reported at the time by El Economista. This is presumably the same land it now hopes to part-trade for the aircraft.Jiménez says he has sent a formal proposal to the government, outlining the terms of the bid, but is yet to receive a reply. Isatech says the land it is offering would be ideal for a tourism development project.In addition to the Boeing 787, which bears the name of revolutionary hero José María Morelos y Pavón, Jiménez wants to buy a Navy helicopter and a Learjet. The CEO stated that the helicopter would be used to fight forest fires and conduct rescue missions in the Monterrey area. The jet, meanwhile, would be used to ferry wealthy Mexicans to the United States to receive medical treatment.The presidential plane itself would be used to transport foreign dignitaries, but would also be made available to the Mexican government in the event of a natural disaster."

","Some members in the crypto community take their interest in politics further than others and seem willing to bet money on the outcome of elections, a new product from crypto derivatives exchange FTX suggests.","While keeping up with what happens with the most traded digital assets is enough for most, some seemingly can’t get enough of trading – constantly searching for new opportunities to make money from their unique insights.To respond to the demand for ever-more innovative trading products, FTX announced that it is adding an entirely new type of futures contract on its platform, namely the TRUMP-2020 (TRUMP) contract. And as you might have guessed, the point here is to bet money on the outcome of the upcoming U.S. presidential election.According to FTX, one TRUMP expires to USD 1 if Trump wins the 2020 U.S. presidential election on November 3, 2020. If he loses, the contract will be worth 0.The terms of the contract also stipulate that if media networks – meaning The New York Times, 538, 270towin, Fox, and CNN – have projected that one of the candidates has won, the contracts will be settled, even if the final count has not been completed.The price of the TRUMP contract will reportedly float in the market to constantly represent the likelihood that Trump wins. In other words, if the market believes there is a 52% probability that Trump wins, the price of each contract will be USD 0.52, FTX explained in its announcement. At pixel time (10:49 UTC), the price is USD 0.62The announcement is perhaps particularly interesting because the price of the contract may turn out to be a reliable predictor of the result of the election, assuming the market becomes reasonably liquid.@SBF_Alameda this will likely have more liquidity than any other election market. thank you for your serviceAlthough so-called prediction markets for political and other types of events have already been around for a while on platforms like Augur (REP), FTX, which is co-owned by Binance, is seemingly the first derivatives market to issue a futures contract on the 2020 U.S. election."

","XRP remains unmoved as the market once again has been hit with speculations about Ripple's initial public offering (IPO). (Updated at 10:02 UTC: the new last paragraph, reactions have been added).","At pixel time (08:58 UTC), XRP, ranked 3rd by market capitalization, trades at c. USD 0.22 and is down almost 4% in the past 24 hours and 6% in a week, while all other major coins are also in red today.Today, the market speculates that Ripple, an American blockchain company focusing on payments technologies, may have an IPO planned for this year. There are reports going about the Cryptoverse that Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, confirmed, or at the very least implied, that this will be the case, during an interview at the World Economic Forum at Davos.Though there are no interviews available to be seen yet, the reports seems to have originated from a tweet by the Senior Vice President of Product Management at Ripple, Asheesh Birla. He seems to imply that this is the case as well by quoting Garlinghouse's alleged words.“In the next 12 months, you’ll see IPOs in the crypto/blockchain space. We’re not going to be the first and we’re not going to be the last, but I expect us to be on the leading side… it’s a natural evolution for our company.” -@bgarlinghouse at #WEF20No further details were provided. At the time of writing, Ripple hasn't replied to our request for comment.  In either case, this wouldn't be the first time Garlinghouse talked about an IPO. Back in September 2017, in an interview with CNBC, the CEO was asked about the pros and cons of a Ripple IPO, and the answer was: ""It’s a flattering question to get. I want to make sure we have the right managerial maturity, infrastructure, and ability to forecast properly."" He added: ""We’ve been around for 4.5 years. At some point it will make sense. Just not today."" Additionally, in 2018 as well, people online were speculating if a Ripple IPO is coming. Meanwhile, in December 2019, Ripple raised USD 200 million in Series C funding from a group of notable investors.Why is an IPO important? IPO basically means ""going public."" It's a major process via which a privately held company issues shares of stock to the public for the first time, and that privately owned business becomes co-owned by public stockholders. While changing who manages and controls the company, an IPO also opens the doors to the public capital, and may in fact bring more exposure and credibility to that company - in this case Ripple. Ripple would likely be welcoming more institutional investors and expanding its offerings, such as the On Demand Liquidity (ODL) payment solution, while XRP could benefit from it as well if seen by stock investors as a potential investment. It's a long process and it requires a permission by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell stock to the public.The community has been discussing what this could mean for the company and for XRP. Though there is a chance of XRP benefiting from the IPO, many in the community seem to believe it'll go in the opposite direction, such as trader Cantering Clark, who tweeted that Garlinghouse ""just pulled the ultimate fade on XRP holders, adding ""Oh, uh guys, yeah we are actually going to IPO now, and offer shares that carry equity..so,...uh....about those coins. (Obsolete)."" Crypto trader Anondran seems to agree.WTF . $XRP is planning to do an IPO??? As if printing worthless coins, pumping it and making billions of dollars wasn't enough?Send this shitcoin to absolute depth of hell.https://t.co/VMFosCo1BZMeanwhile, as reported, looking into the new decade, it seems that token sales might decline in importance for crypto projects and that in their place traditional investment and venture capital will become more significant.Here are a couple more reactions:Guys. This means they go public. More publicity, move trusted investors in XRP. Stop the crying.__please NO IPO at least until we see 10 X- 50 X in XRP price. This was and is one of my biggest concerns about Ripple, but maybe unfounded-time will tell. I just don't like the idea of other rich people deciding where Ripple is going :-("

",Major crypto exchange Binance now aims to find more merchants for its a peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto trading platform in an attempt to meet “growing demand.”,"The company launched a global peer-to-peer (P2P) merchant program, encouraging merchants to use the exchange as a way of providing payments through fiat currencies and earn revenue by doing so. “When we first launched our P2P trading services last October, we carefully selected merchants to protect users’ interest,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said, adding that “In the past quarter, there has been increasing growth in trading volumes on Binance P2P platform, and we have constantly received requests for more fiat-to-crypto access from our global community.” This week, Binance announced its support for Vietnamese Dong (VND) on its P2P trading platform. The CEO did not provide any numbers about the P2P trading on their platform.The greatest threat facing P2P platforms is often nefarious users. Because there is no centralized governance system, black hat merchants and traders can often take widespread advantage of the naive. For protection, the company has created an unspecified elimination mechanism for poor merchants. While not explicit, it appears that eliminated merchants would be unable to participate in future P2P solutions that the company offers.

","The Customer Electronics Show (CES 2020) is already in full swing. And this year’s event, now being held in Las Vegas and winding up on January 10, will have a special significance for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry – following on from themes first explored at CES 2019.","But for many, this will be the year when innovators and industrialists must stop talking about blockchain, and actually start making money from it.Nowhere is that truer than South Korea – where many of the country’s largest conglomerates, banks and business groups spent 2019 talking about how much blockchain-related tech they would be commercializing in 2020. South Korean media outlets such as Fn News have been reporting about some of the companies set to showcase blockchain-related solutions at CES 2020. But not only South Korean companies participate in the event. Here are some highlights.Samsung’s IT services arm, Samsung SDS, is displaying a blockchain-powered automotive parts management solution, as well as its own mainnet, Nexledger. The company has previously developed interoperability solutions that it claims have already helped bridge the gap for companies and government entities that make use of different blockchain protocols. It is also extremely active in the areas of logistics and shipping.South Korea’s answer to Microsoft has been busy creating a blockchain-powered suite of office solutions, but will also unveil what it says is a comprehensive data management platform for a wide range of certification, including birth certificates, digital identification, education records, employment history and medical records. Interestingly, the same platform also appears to offer blockchain-verified cryptocurrency trading data records. The company will also exhibit details about its own mainnet, as well as smart contract technology.This startup is affiliated with KAIST, South Korea’s biggest tech university, often referred to as East Asia’s MIT. In fact, ReDWit will be making its CES debut this year, presenting its blockchain solutions at a KAIST booth. These include a blockchain solution designed with academics in mind: one that will allow researchers to make, log and share research notes both online and offline, using a wide range of file formats and devices.Singapore-based blockchain company Pundi X is using the CES to reintroduce their blockchain-powered smartphone, now called Blok On Blok, or just BoB. The device comes with a special operating system called f(x) or Function X OS. It allows users access to the Function X ecosystem, so that every call, text, or action made online, is decentralized. Each BOB functions as a node, so the more BOBs deployed means a stronger decentralized Function X ecosystem.This startup company from Taiwan that focuses on applying blockchain technology to retail industry, launched what it calls the world's first all-in-one cryptocurrency retail payment solution built with blockchain hardware wallet - and exhibited it at CES. SecuX Cryptocurrency Retail Payment Solution includes three components: (1) a White-label Mobile App that can add any crypto payment with the existing fiat-currency payment app; (2) a Payment Terminal/Module that can operate without the internet connection; (3) a Hardware Wallet with a military-grade Secure Element chip.This Silicon Valley startup offers a blockchain-based omnichannel mobile experience through integrating social messaging, mobile commerce, and fintech services. Zocial’s wants to power the new Blockchain network with its technology called Integrated Blockchain Architecture™, which they claim provides a systems approach to solving limitations in scalability, security, and latency. This Luxembourg-based platform built on a decentralized mutuality-based system aims to enable the next generation of insurance, particularly for the 500 million or more uninsurable smallholder farmers. It does this by allowing farmer-to-farmer risks to be shared in a transparent and cost-efficient manner, and it uses blockchain, satellite earth observation data and index-based risk modeling to accomplish this, their website says.Chinese KryptoGO is a blockchain search engine that organizes all cross-chain information for usability and readability, the aim being to make blockchain more accessible and to hasten the adoption of crypto. Therefore, they've launched a RegTech (regulatory technology) solution built on top of KryptoGO's data infrastructure that analyzes on-chain data to connect virtual worlds with real-world identities. Furthermore, to make compliance easy, KryptoGO wants to solve the non-interoperability issue of travel rule standards by introducing a FATF/FinCEN compliant regulation kit.Coming from New York, this startup is exhibiting their blockchain router, with a goal of bringing decentralized internet to every home across the world. The product enables its users to connect to the internet through an encrypted channel from any place in the world, and access regular websites, but also browse through the blockchain-based websites, which are not available otherwise. The second-largest producer of Bitcoin mining equipment, China-based Canaan, will also be exhibiting their blockchain chips and system solutions products at the CES. It will continue its promotion of the multi-level design development and in-depth application of ASIC super-calculation chips for the multi-disciplinary areas.The Netherlands-based project has developed a Blockchain-based Transparency Solution to trace products from its source to the finished product, that way giving the consumers full transparency over the entire process by utilizing blockchain and zero-knowledge. Furthermore, it enables sustainability and a circular economy in supply chains. The producers/companies can provide information about their products and their supply chains in a transparent way without risking privacy.  There are a number of blockchain companies and protocols at CES this year presenting their solutions and infrastructure capabilities:ANote Music is a marketplace for buying and selling Music Rights based in Luxembourg. They want to innovate the current music industry by, among other things introducing it to the blockchain. The team claims that this allows artists, record labels, publishers and songwriters to become financially independent and get funds immediately, which they'd be earning over many years otherwise.Netherlands-basked Fluidensity is a certified blockchain platform for the tokenization of art and other assets. They offer a complete platform for Security Token Offering, reportedly approved by financial authorities in the EU. Artists and collectors can use its platform to convert the ownership of art into digital certificates, thus collecting, trading, and exposing art in a new way via these tokens. Furthermore, the company says, blockchain makes collecting and trading art secure, transparent, and inclusive.This product exhibited at CES comes from the U.S. - EmP Fitness is a blockchain-based solution that collects data from fitness apps, wearables, equipment, free weights, group exercises, and more, in order to store it on the blockchain. It gives its users control over that data, can share data anywhere, and earn money.In this department, we find the U.S.-based Crypto Watches, which is showing off its Blockchain Watch Face brand. Utilizing their patent-pending blockchain technology, the company creates digital collectible smartwatch faces that they claim are compatible with almost every smartwatch out there. Watch Skins, also from the U.S, is a Blockchain Watch Face Marketplace. Their patent-pending technology allows popular brands to sell digital collectible smartwatch faces for almost any smartwatch, says the company. This is done via blockchain to ensure authenticity and scarcity of the licensed watch face. Finally, just yesterday we've written about another CES participant: 2020 CES Innovation Awards Honoree, Taiwan-based AuthenTrend. They exhibited their new fingerprint enabled crypto wallet, called AT.Wallet.

","Two former BitTorrent employees are suing Tron (TRX) for USD 15 million alleging they witnessed workplace violence, were harassed into product launches, and experienced wrongful dismissal.","The allegations were made in a lawsuit filed against Tron, its founder Justin Sun and Cong Li, the lead engineer of the Tron Foundation and BitTorrent.The lawsuit was filed in California in October 2019, but was made public last week.Tron responded by issuing a statement – and was quoted by media outlet CoinDesk as stating that although it could not comment on “pending litigation, “what we can tell you is that our customers, employees and the Tron community are extremely important to us.”The plaintiffs are former BitTorrent engineers Richard Hall and Lukasz Juraszek. Hall says he was bullied into fast-tracking BitTorrent software releases to meet Tron roadmap targets and provided what he alleged are chat app messages from Li and Sun as evidence.Perhaps more worrying are the allegations of workplace violence, with Juraszek claiming he witnessed Li attacking an unnamed manager.Per the legal document, Juraszek claimed that he “saw two sets of shoes under a conference room door and then heard a loud commotion coming from the room.” This was followed by the sound of “what seemed like a punch, slap or a strike of a hand.” Juraszek says that the manager was left with a “red face” and “glossy” eyes after the alleged attack.Juraszek also claimed that Sun slapped Li on at least one occasion and was not disciplined for the assault.The plaintiffs claim that Sun and Li verbally intimidated and bullied employees – both in-person and online via group chats.And the plaintiffs further claimed that their warnings about possible third-party copyright issues and child pornography risks were ignored.
In addition to damages, plaintiffs say they want the American government to investigate possible labor law violations.Tron, Sun and Li have issued a legal response to the allegations, claiming that the plaintiffs’ allegations lack factual substance. Tron’s lawyers claim that the court lacks jurisdiction on the case, and claims the dismissals were both above-board. Tron also demanded that Hall and Juraszek pay the company’s legal costs.

","2020 will see the mining pools start to integrate more altcoin mining with huge market potential and risks, says token data and rating agency TokenInsight.","The agency's 2019 mining industry report claims that there are only 64 mineable coins including Bitcoin (BTC) with more than USD 100,000 trading volume in 24 hours, and these (with BTC) account for 82% of total crypto market capitalization. What we're seeing now is altcoin mining and staking entering the “main” stage, says the report. These will get more market attention, and an increasing number of mining pools will start to integrate them, wanting to differentiate their services, diversify revenue streams and compete with other mining pools.Also, as the industry faces the issues of transparency and supervision, major mining pools are actively building brand credibility, and it’s likely that the future will bring inspection and reporting in cooperation with independent third parties and decentralized mining pool protocol.This year, we might also see more cloud mining products launched targeting the broader market. However, the future of the cloud mining market is outside of China, particularly in Russia, TokenInsight finds, adding that the number of users in Russia is “staggering.” The country’s development and participation in BTC mining will increase in 2020 with the ease of policies on crypto, but also the weather advantages.According to the researchers, cloud mining platforms are relatively concentrated, with nine platforms sharing more than 80% of the market, while most of the cloud mining products are currently unprofitable. Taking the Bitcoin mining reward halving in May into account, under the current mining difficulty and BTC price, “most of the cloud mining products on the market are not worth investing in.” When the block reward is halved, if the hashrate, or the computing power of the entire network, is reduced by the same proportion, then less than half of the cloud mining products tracked by TokenInsight can’t make a positive ROI (return on investment), says the agency.Also, the researchers claim that the whole mining industry is extremely concentrated, with the top four companies accounting for c. 95% of the market. The agency made 2020 predictions for SHA-256 ASIC mining hardware market shares, finding that Bitmain will continue its reign with 63%, Canaan will climb up, back to the 2nd place, with 18% of the market share. If Eband goes public in 2020, it will have a positive impact on its market share and will squeeze out other players. Whatsminer has more than 20% of the market share in 2019, but its founder Yang Zuoxing, was arrested  in 2019.Nonetheless, what will largely determine the success or failure of mining hardware manufacturers, says the report, is the support of chip makers. The chip supply is relatively in shortage, and mining hardware manufacturers have to compete with mobile phones for it.

",The Arizona District Attorney (DA) has announced that two men have been charged with fraud and money laundering offenses after allegedly duping victims – including octogenarians and a number of ex-Major League Baseball (MLB) players – into investments in a bogus crypto investment fund.,"The DA said that John Michael Caruso, 28, and Zachary Salter, aged 27, were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud via their company, Zima Digital Assets. A criminal complaint filed by the American Secret Service to a state magistrate’s court judge outlines how the duo allegedly embezzled millions of dollars’ worth of investor funds from June 2018 to January 2020.The document, which was shared online by media outlet Quartz, includes details of the two men’s social media activities, describing how they were “riding together on private jets,” as well as “photographs and videos of two large mansions (one valued at approximately USD 9 million dollars, located in Paradise Valley, and one valued at approximately USD 8.5 million, located in Scottsdale).”The duo appears to have run the company as a Ponzi scheme, promising to reward investors for bringing new members onboard.The complaint states that Zima Digital Assets had been used to amass funds for its founders’ extravagant lifestyles.Data provided by the Arizona Motor Vehicle Division shows that Caruso owns a 2019 Lamborghini Urus, and Salter is the owner of a number of luxury cars, including a Mercedes-Benz and a BMW.Details of Salter’s credit card spending showed that he had spent money on luxury car rentals, designer clothing, firearms, travel and expensive hotels. The document also contained descriptions of the pair’s alleged victims, including a 76-year-old who transferred a total of USD 200,000 to Caruso, and an 86-year-old who sent him USD 60,000. The victim list is allegedly long, and includes former MLB players and their families.Per grand jury subpoenas sent to a number of American financial institutions, victims invested USD 7.5 million worth of funds with Caruso to invest in cryptocurrencies, with only about USD 1.9 million returned.Forensic accountants say they have found no proof that any of those funds, received from about 90 individual and corporate investors, had ever been invested in cryptocurrency.The fund’s revenues contrasted starkly with the men’s declared earnings. In 2018, Caruso’s reported earned income was USD 22,800, while Salter reported he had made zero dollars in earnings over the same period.The men went to great lengths to generate publicity for their business. One Media OutReach article published on media platforms as recently as August last year, stated that Zima Digital Assets was a “premier cryptocurrency fund” and claimed it was “one of the fastest-growing crypto investment funds in the world.”The piece called Caruso the “Michael Jordan of Algorithmic Cryptocurrency Trading.”The article’s author wrote that Caruso was “one of the top cryptocurrency traders amongst high profile investors on Wall Street,” and even went on to posit that he was the “world’s greatest cryptocurrency trader of all time, because of his ability to time markets, spot trends and sort data/key pieces of information for trades.”"

","One of the best-known privacy coins, Zcash (ZEC), has jumped on the news that its community has said 'yes' to changes to Zcash mining rewards, meant to support the coin's development.","ZEC has gone up 12% in the past day, 30% in a week, and a whopping 132% in a month, landing on USD 66 (at 10:21 UTC). The 25th coin by market capitalization of USD 578 million started rallying already at the beginning of January, dropping somewhat several times on its appreciating path, but then making a higher comeback.ZEC price chart:The rally seems to be the result of the new methodology for distributing network mining rewards being voted in by the Zcash community, in order to support the development of ZEC, following the expiration of the current reward system in 2020. The poll, concerned with ZIP (Zcash Improvement Proposal) 1014, has ended, seeing the support of the majority of voters.With 88 votes cast, the decision is as follows: if the Zcash Foundation and the Electric Coin Company (ECC; a ZEC supporter) agree, as of block 1046400, coinciding with the first scheduled Zcash mining reward halving this November, 80% of the mining reward will go to miners, 7% to ECC, 5% to the Zcash Foundation and 8% to grants, according to a blog post by ECC's Josh Swihart. Since its launch in 2016, the post explains, 80% of mining rewards were allocated to miners, c. 15% to a group that included investors and founders, and c. 5% to ECC to fund core support functions. It adds:Grant participants will receive the largest portion of development funds which will further decentralize Zcash-related efforts. Stipulations were also introduced for formal accountability and reporting requirements of each participant. As for what's to come, neither the Foundation nor ECC can make a unilateral decision regarding a Zcash chain, nor can one of them override the community's will. If the two agree on the final ZIP that reflects the community’s will, that ZIP will be codified in the network upgrade scheduled for activation in November. ""The final ratification of community sentiment will happen at the time of activation, when the community opts into the network upgrade,"" says ECC.Chris Burniske, partner at the crypto-focused venture capital firm Placeholder, that has also invested in Zcash, tweeted about it, saying this coin will be remembered as one of the most oversold in 2018/2019.Now that we know @ElectricCoinCo will continue to get funded & 3rd party devs will have access to 40% of non-miner block rewards, it's nice to see the market buoying $ZEC (> 2x in 1 month). We'll look back on $ZEC as one of the most oversold quality coins of the 2018/2019 bear.Some of the rivals criticized the project. Riccardo Spagni, a member of the privacy-oriented Monero Core Team, argued that it's not possible to know if there are any sockpuppet votes among those cast for the ZIP, saying that ""Zcash have literally thrown out their social contract on that basis. I suspect that the market will prove to be rational, remaining disinterested in a centralized science project,"" he said. Swihart, however, replied that the debate on the funding lasted for over a year.Hi Leon. Trusted setup is tied to performant zero knowledge cryptography, for now. Governance of Zcash development funding was broadly inclusive of its community, though not perfect. Final ratification happens when people choose to use Zcash after consensus rules are activated.___Learn more:

","Venezuela is in talks with Cuba about using the Petro, the former’s state-issued, oil-backed cryptocurrency, in bilateral payments including trade deals.","Per the Venezuelan state-run newspaper Correo del Orinoco, the two nations talked on the matter of cryptocurrencies at their most recent intergovernmental summit, held in the Casa Amarilla in Caracas last week.The newspaper states,“An important announcement was made at the meeting: Both countries will evaluate guaranteeing their agreements with the Petro cryptocurrency.”The Venezuelan and Cuban governments made a number of trade-related agreements at the summit and pledged to work together on a number of economic measures.The nations have signed an estimated 1,400 agreements since 2000, and reaffirmed their ties last week in Caracas, with sport, culture, energy, telecommunications, healthcare and agriculture pledges signed.Correo del Orinoco stated that using the Petro in these deals would help “strengthen the economy and Venezuelan means of production.”Both nations have been hit heavily by American sanctions, which have escalated significantly in the past year.Caracas has openly spoken about its determination to bypass Washington’s sanctions via its crypto-economic drive. President Nicolás Maduro claims that international parties have accepted Petro payments in the past – despite American assertions that any companies or nations found to be dealing in Petros will face punitive measures.Regardless, Maduro has stated on several occasions that he remains in talks with international counterparts about accepting the Petro in payments deals. Moscow has previously discounted the possibility of dealing in the Petro, but Maduro is thought to be optimistic about changing Vladimir Putin’s mind on the matter.Venezuela’s other major ally, Iran, could also be targeted as another potential Petro collaborator should Havana decide in favor of using the oil-backed cryptocurrency.An American think-tank last year warned that America’s opponents (including Iran, Venezuela and Russia) are drawing up long-term strategies involving digital currencies, cryptocurrencies, and stablecoins in an effort to bypass United States sanctions."

","Bitspark, a bankless money transfer solution utilizing blockchain technology, will be shutting down in a month, despite reporting positive results.","Hong Kong-based company will be closing its doors on March 4, 2020, announced CEO and Co-founder George Harrap. The startup's Co-founder, Maxine Ryan, also shared the news to many unsuspecting followers on Twitter. This is an unfortunate reality Bitspark has had to face. While this isn’t easy to say, as of 4th of March, Bitspark will no longer be operating and providing its services. These announcements, especially in the #crypto space, always causes distress. 1/ https://t.co/YX7g7sWq1nThough the news might've been sudden to the followers and users, it seems that the situation has been developing towards this culmination of events for a while now. The announcement states that despite ""an excellent performance"" seen since the release of their Cash Point product in late 2019, which has seen a ""great demand and 400% month-to-month growth"" - ""due to internal restructuring that hasn't worked out, and a decision taken by shareholders internally,"" the startup decided to shut down. They add that the Hong Kong protests and Coronavirus epidemic haven't affected them much, but that ""they haven't helped the situation either.""Ryan used her post to explain the situation further, saying that after six years of hard work and struggle, Bitspark hit their limit. A month ago, she says, she stepped down from her position as the Chief Operating Officer, resulting in the need to restructure the company, which ultimately led to the decision to close their doors. ""While I hoped the company would continue especially due to the [month-on-month] growth,"" writes Ryan, ""it was determined that due to its inconstancy it wasn’t predictable enough to continue.""No further details about the failed restructuring of the company were provided.I have to respectfully accept this decision. This paired with the landscape of Hong Kong with protests and the coronavirus where Bitspark HQ is located. The team and shareholders decided this was the best way forward to prevent integrity decay of the company 5/The functionality will remain intact for the customers to withdraw their crypto until March 4, after which, account logins will be disabled for a period of 90 days.Bitspark was founded in 2014, and it launched its ZEPH Rewards Token ICO in 2017, raising USD 1.3 million worth of cryptocurrency, according to Trackico. Until now, they were working on creating stablecoins pegged to the world’s 180+ fiat currencies wanting to revolutionize cross-border money transfers, their website states.

","Blockchain games have endless expansion possibilitiesOne of the perks of working in the blockchain industry is that I have the chance to see innovation almost on a daily basis. Recently I had the opportunity to see two different verticals converge, and thatâ€™s the reason I would like to share more about Axie Infinity and Uniswap: a decentralized game meets a decentralized finance protocol.Axie Infinity is a game (dapp) that runs on the Ethereum blockchain, where users can collect, raise, breed and battle virtual creatures called axies. Axies are really similar to real-life pets and each one has itâ€™s own unique traits and appearance. Before going into battles, you need a team of 3 axies, and there are a few ways to acquire the cute little beasts. You can buy axies from the Axie Infinity Marketplace that was recently launched, from 3rd party marketplaces like OpenSea, or by participating in the giveaways, there are often people in the community offering free axies (yes, their community is amazing).In the December update, along with other great features like real-time card battles or PvE mode, they have also introduced a new token: Small Love Potion.The Small Love Potion (SLP) can be earned by battling in the PvP Arena or by playing the PvE Adventure mode.Breeding axies will result in an egg that will go through different transformations before it becomes an adult axie.âš  Breeding Axies now requires love potions.Introducing the love potions into the breeding mechanism makes total sense for the Axie Infinity ecosystem because it encourages the users to actually play the game before they can breed their axies. You might wonder why breeding axies is important? Breeding two axies with good traits can result in a unique axie that can improve your team and help you win more battles, or it can be sold at any time for ETH.Hereâ€™s the interesting part. Small Love Potion (SLP) is an ERC-20 token that can be used on the Ethereum blockchain. At the time of launch, the token had no predefined value (in ETH) as it was earned by playing the game. But because playing Axie Infinity is actually valuable, the community immediately identified the value and created a liquidity pool on Uniswap, and SLP actually started to have a trading value.ðŸ¤¯ What is a liquidity pool? What is Uniswap?Uniswap is a protocol for automated token exchange that is using a series of Ethereum smart contracts. It facilitates the exchange between ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but also between ERC-20 and ERC-20 tokens. Uniswap runs completely on-chain. Another great thing about Uniswap is that anyone can create a new exchange pair for any ERC-20 token, also no listing fees are required. Each exchange created holds reserves of both ETH and its ERC-20 token pair. Anyone can become a liquidity provider on an exchange and contribute to its reserves, basically participating in the liquidity pool.âž¡ You can read more about Uniswap and liquidity pools here.At the moment, anyone can sell or buy SLP tokens on Uniswap, but can also be a liquidity provider. This opens more possibilities for the players to earn ETH and this serves as a great experiment for further development of the dapps ecosystem.ETH â‡† SLP Uniswap pool statisticsAt the time of writing, the pool reserves are 52,861 SLP tokens and 8,809 ETH with a total liquidy of 2,518 USD. There are 33 liquidity providers and the price of 1 SLP is 0.00017 ETH (0.024 USD).âž¡ More details about the ETH â‡† SLP exchange pool can be found on Pools.fyiAxie Infinity introduced a new token (SLP) for breeding axies, the community felt excited about this and started a liquidity pool on Uniswap. Now anyone can trade SPL tokens or be a liquidity provider on Uniswap."

","At the tech giant, Chatterjee was tasked with implementing and managing Google Shopping for the past 11 years, and now he will take on product details with Coinbase. The move reflects the growing desire within Coinbase to expand their reach to mirror larger technology companies. The company expects that such acquisitions of personnel will move their suite of products forward, not only in the U.S., but internationally. “Surojit’s insights and experiences on the front lines of global commerce make him the perfect person to lead our product organization,” Coinbase said.The company hopes that he will parley that influential spirit into their product development structures. Chatterjee himself suggests that his interest in cryptocurrencies is growing. “Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology can help open up the financial system for everyone by growing cross-border commerce, lowering transaction costs, providing higher security and by helping individuals have more control over their financial future,” he was quoted as saying in the announcement.The appointment also reflects a growing expansion in the Coinbase ecosystem. After a number of years of stringent listing requirements, the exchange surprised the crypto market by listing a number of lesser-known altcoins in 2019.Each of the additions also played a role in moving the company into wider sections of the crypto asset market. However, naysayers suggest that the additions also diminish the potential for Coinbase to act as a simple onboarding option for new consumers coming into the cryptosphere. The company claims it has more than 30 million users.As reported by Cryptonews.com, this year, we're likely to see a range of crypto-exchanges diversifying into new services and functionality.

","Ripple, an American blockchain company focusing on payments technologies, reduced sales of XRP from its escrow fund last quarter when it secured USD 200 million in funding.","According to their report, the reductions in Q4 follows that sharp reduction that was recorded in Q3, with the main difference this time being that exchange sales of XRP have been cut to zero. Instead, all XRP sales by Ripple are now done as over-the-counter (OTC) trades, the company said. (Learn more: Ripple is Selling XRP at a Discount to Some Institutional Buyers)In Q4, total sales dropped 80%, to USD 13 million, after falling 74% in Q3. “[…] in Q2 2019, Ripple shifted to a more conservative volume benchmark for XRP sales, away from CoinMarketCap and to CryptoCompare Top Tier (CCTT) and significantly reduced XRP sales. In Q3 2019, Ripple further reduced XRP sales and paused programmatic sales (exchange sales). Ripple maintained this approach throughout the entirety of Q4,” the report for the 4th quarter of 2019 said.The announcement about the further reduction in XRP sales from Ripple comes after the company in December said that it had raised USD 200 million in a Series C funding round from a group of notable investors. As reported, the funding round was led by global investment firm Tetragon, with participation from Ripple-friendly SBI Holdings and others.The recent reduction in XRP selling also caught the attention of crypto analytics firm Messari, which pointed out that the USD 200 million capital raise almost canceled out the effect of the reduced XRP sales for Ripple: “Interestingly, the steep drop-off coincides with Ripple’s USD 200 million Series C round announced in December of last year,” the firm wrote while adding:“The USD 200 million capital raise would make a significant difference, closing the USD 342 million gap down from 1H’19 to 2H’19, showing that previous XRP sales have likely been used for funding Ripple’s ongoing operations.”Cumulative XRP sales surpassed USD 1.2 billion, according to Messari.In October 2019, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, said that the company ""has more than USD 305 million in cash in the bank"" and also owns some USD 15 billion worth of XRP.Meanwhile, today, the market speculates that Ripple may have an IPO planned for this year. At pixel time (11:27 UTC), XRP trades at c. USD 0.216 and is down by 5% in a day and more than 8 in a week. The price dropped by almost 27% in the past 3 months."

","Scalability is a long-standing and oft-discussed blockchain issue, for which many Cryptoverse residents have been searching a solution. Today we look into two of the latest ideas that aim to solve the problem and make transactions faster and more efficient.","Asensys, a blockchain system created by former Microsoft lead researcher JiaPing Wang, is designed to avoid repetition in existing blockchains, namely Ethereum and Bitcoin, and surpass them both by increasing network performance. The startup says that the workload is distributed across independent zones that comprise the network. The tests, they claim, have already shown a lot more throughput and capacity. The Asynchronous Consensus Zones have been proposed in a paper presented by Wang and Hao Wang of Ohio State University at the 2019 the USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI). It scales blockchain system linearly but reportedly without compromising decentralization or security, claim the authors, by running numerous parallel and independent zones – instances of single-chain consensus systems. The consensus happens independently within each zone with minimized communication, which partitions the workload of the entire network and ensures a moderate burden for each individual node as the network grows.""What we discovered through comprehensive research and analysis,"" Wang says, ""is that the limitations of scalability in blockchain networks are not based on the type of consensus algorithm deployed, as many would believe, but on the fact that every single node must duplicate the entire network each time a new block is added."" Co-founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin and Ethereum developers are trying out sharding as a solution, where nodes process only parts of transactions, while Bitcoin developers are working on layer 2 solutions, most well-known of which is the Lightning Network, and this enables certain transactions to be processed off-chain so the network wouldn’t get clogged.Asensys experiment showed ""that performance by the Asensys protocol increases proportionately to the community size."" A test was reportedly conducted using 1,200 virtual machines across the world to support 48,000 nodes, finding that the Asensys system delivers 1,000 times the throughput and 2,000 times the capacity of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. MIT researchers have co-invented a new cryptocurrency-routing scheme that they claim can boost the efficiency, and with it - profits, of certain networks that are already designed to make blockchain transactions faster. The researchers will be presenting a paper next month at NSDI, which will introduce “Spider” - a routing scheme that enables users to invest only a fraction of funds in each account and process c. four times more transactions before rebalancing on the blockchain, reports MIT news.Spider comes with some innovations. It splits each full transaction into smaller “packets.” These are then sent across different channels at different rates. The scheme can route fractions of large payments through possibly low-funded accounts, thus making the transactions faster and each packet less likely to be rejected for its size in any account.Also included is an algorithm that monitors data center congestion in order to find queueing delays at congested accounts, further helping to control the rate of transactions. The article explains that compared to thousand of transactions per second processed by major credit cards, Bitcoin can process only a handful, because blockchain, despite a myriad of its benefits, takes a long time to do this. There is a new solution, called “payment channel networks” (PCNs), where blockchain has a minimal involvement in transactions, as users route payments through an interconnected network of joint accounts, which is created by pairs of PCN users who form off-blockchain escrow accounts with a dedicated amount of money. ""Ultimately, the more balanced the routing of PCNs, the smaller the capacity required — meaning, overall funds across all joint accounts — for high transaction throughput.""However, even this fast solution is slowed down by insufficient routing schemes, claim the researchers, depleting users’ balances in these accounts along the way, making them invest a lot of money in each account or frequently rebalance their accounts.One of the authors, Vibhaalakshmi Sivaraman, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), is cited in the article as saying:It’s important to have balanced, high-throughput routing in PCNs to ensure the money that users put into joint accounts is used efficiently. This should be efficient and a lucrative business. That means routing as many transactions as possible, with as little funds as possible, to give PCNs the best bang for their buck.In PCN simulations, claim the authors, Spider processed 95% of all transactions using only 25% of the capacity needed in traditional schemes, and it's able to process eight times as many off-chain transactions for each transaction on-chain, compared to twice as many off-chain transactions supported by traditional schemes.__Meanwhile, we reported last year that Buterin’s new Ethereum scalability solution that would include using the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain as the data layer, was met with a wave of criticism by the crypto community."

","Compared to 2018, California-based blockchain startup focusing on payment technologies, Ripple, had more lobbyist but spent less on lobbying in the first three quarters of 2019, according to OpenSecrets.org – database of the Centre for Responsive Politics, a non-profit research group. ","The data, based on numbers provided by the Senate Office of Public Records, shows that Ripple had USD 170,000 in lobbying expenditures in the first three quarters of 2019, or 48% less than in the same period in 2018 when it spent USD 170,000 in Q3 alone.Ripple would have had to spend USD 280,000 in that last quarter of 2019 just to reach the amount spent the entire year before.Nonetheless, the company had six lobbyists during last year representing their interests in front of officials, legislators and/or regulators, compared to five in 2018.Three issues were lobbied by Ripple Labs in 2019: Science and Technology, Finance, and Banking, as well as one agency: Executive Office of the President, which consists of the immediate staff to the President, along with entities such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of the United States Trade Representative.As for the hired firms, the available data for 2019 shows that USD 100,000 was spent on two Washington-based lobbying firms, ACG Analytics and Williams and Jensen. Robert Nicholas Wagener from the former was hired for the job, while the latter company had three people lobbying for Ripple: David E. Franasiak (also lobbied for TD Ameritrade, OTC Market Group, Security Trade Association, Colonial Pipline, Oklahoma Gas and Electricity, etc.), Joel Oswald (also lobbied for Visa Inc, Federation of Exchange Accommodators, Federal Home Loan Bank, etc.), and Christopher Wilcox (also lobbied for Compcast Copr, Roche Holdings, National Assn of State Treasurers, etc.). These four are identified as “revolvers.” The Centre defines the term “revolving door” as the common practice of government regulators, Congressional staff and members of Congress to take a job with lobbying firms and private sector organizations, which they used to oversee in many cases.Additionally, Manager of Government Relations at Ripple, Ron Hammond, and Head of Research and Director of Regulatory Relations at Ripple, Ryan Zagone, were hired for in-house lobbying, the site states. The bill for the lobbying of which Ripple allegedly hired these people is the Token Taxonomy Act of 2019, H.R. 2144, which was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in April 2019, with the goal to provide regulatory certainty for companies and regulators in the blockchain economy of the country, by clarifying existing rulings, judicial decisions, and initiatives. We reported on the draft on this bill already in December 2018.Also as reported, in July 2019, Ripple executives sent an open letter to the U.S. Congress, urging the lawmakers to support crypto regulation that does not disadvantage U.S. companies and does not paint crypto assets with ""a broad brush,"" but the one that “classifies digital currencies in a way that recognizes their fundamental differences.”Meanwhile, XRP is currently (10:55 UTC) trading at c. USD 0.23. It went up 4% in the past 24 hours and 16% in a week."

","The Bank of Lithuania, the country’s central bank, has approved a physical sample of the LBCoin, a token that it claims will be the world’s first blockchain-powered digital commemorative coin. The bank says the token will be issued in spring this year.","The coin is made of silver and will be valued at exactly EUR 19.18 (USD 21.27) – a reference to 1918, the year when Lithuania first declared its independence from Russia.The bank says that the physical collectors’ edition coin has been designed to look like a credit card.And its design is not short on symbolism: It features a depiction of the Independence Act signed on February 16, 1918, as well as a digitized picture of the Council of Lithuania.The picture is made up of over 36,500 pixels – almost the same number of days that have passed since the Act of Independence was issued, the bank said in a statement shared with Cryptonews.com.The bank added,“The Lithuanian flag on the reverse of the coin [features] the national anthem inscribed in binary code.”The other side of the coin bears the Vytis – the Lithuanian national coat of arms.The design also features a QR code that is linked to the e-shop where digital tokens will be sold.The bank is aiming to issue 24,000 LBCoins on its online store. The store will provide its customers with dedicated wallets where they can store the coin, although they will also be able to transfer their LBCoins to NEM wallets.The bank added that digital coin buyers would be able to claim their physical silver coins from designated outlets.____Meanwhile, the bank is continuing in its efforts to step up its central bank digital currency (CBDC) operations.In December last year, the bank said that the LBCoin was part of “a controlled experiment” and an “in vitro test of multiple practical aspects relevant to the broader CBDC discussion.”The bank is also working on a blockchain-based technological sandbox named LBChain. The sandbox will see international fintech firms bid for the right to test their offerings at Lithuanian financial institutions.So far, six companies from three countries have made use of the sandbox.The bank says that these include a “Know-Your-Customer solution for anti-money laundering compliance, a cross-border payments solution, smart contracts for factoring process management, a payment token, a mobile point-of-sale and payment card solution, a crowdfunding platform and an unlisted share trading platform.”Also in December 2019, speaking of CBDC, the Bank of Lithuania said that “Single-jurisdictional level initiatives are not capable of meeting a global citizens’ need for a safe, trustworthy, and cost-efficient instrument for cross-border payments."" According to the bank, modern-day technology seems to be able to address this need: ""The issue, including the idea of multicurrency CBDC deserves deep joint analysis."""

",The price of the DigixDAO (DGD) token rallied recently as the team is closing their decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) DigixDAO this quarter and promising to buy back DGD at a higher price.,"Since talks about the dissolution of the DAO started in November, the price more than doubled and trades against ethereum (ETH) at c. ETH 0.182 (13:42 UTC), or almost the same price at which DGD should be bought back (ETH 0.19).Against USD, DGD, ranked 83rd by market capitalization, is up 1.4% today, 11% in a week, almost 80% in a month, and trades at c. USD 32.As reported, DigixDAO, a platform created to encourage the growth of projects and ecosystems around the Digix Gold Token (DGX) (a gold-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network) by leveraging the DGD community, proposed the introduction of a dissolution mechanism to DigixDAO in late November. The dissolution of DigixDAO is impartial to DGX and Digix. DGX and Digix will continue to remain. Meanwhile, DAO is a blockchain-powered virtual organization that operates independently of any central authority based on a set of predefined coded rules. The proposal, called 'Project Ragnarok' is a result of dissatisfied DGD holders' comments, wanting to “make a clean break from DigixDAO.“ While DGX is the core product at Digix representing gold bars, DGD that was offered on DigixDAO gave voting rights on projects submitted on the platform, explains a Project Ragnarok FAQ document. Furthermore, DigixDAO has voted to liquidate its USD 64 million treasury and will be returning all ETH to initial coin offering (ICO) investors. This will involve unstaking and giving back ETH 0.19 per DGD. The remaining DGD in circulation will be destroyed.Digix said that the Digix ecosystem has benefited from and was strengthened by the support of the DigixDAO platform, adding that they are proud of the platform's achievements and are against its dissolution, but that they will adhere to the collective opinion of DGD holders on the platform's future nonetheless. Hence Digix abstained from voting.“While we felt strongly that the full vision of DigixDAO was not able to bear fruit, we are uplifted that the merits of the DAO model, where token holders are able to direct the proceeding course of action for a blockchain organization and be able to exit such an organization if they chose to,” said Kai C. Chng, CEO and Co-Founder of Digix.Besides a full dissolution of DigixDAO, other community suggestions included transferring ownership of DGDs, as well as a smart contract to allow DGD token holders to ‘burn’ their DGD in return for a proportion of ETH in DigixDAO. But as to why the holders were dissatisfied in the first place and wanted to cut ties with the DAO, Digix referred a blog post, saying that ""Digix understands that participation in DigixDAO platform may not be for everyone, especially for those who cannot put aside time to actively vote and create projects on DigixDAO.""Commenters online have mentioned a number of alleged issues with DigixDAO, such as that investors from many countries, the U.S. included, couldn't participate in the governance. Another Redditor, u/hhh2hhh, claimed that c. 50% of the current DigixDAO holdings had been disbursed with almost no results, saying that nothing will be left at that pace. As DGD doesn't have a use, says the post, but carries extra fees, when most of the ETH in the DAO is spent, DigixDAO would lose its purpose, the fees would still be extracted, and DGX's competitiveness would decrease. Furthermore, while DGD holders risk to lose all the ETH, company Digix can't lose what they've received, claims the poster.4/ with the option to ""burn"" DGD tokens and claim back your share of ETH, this would immediately jump the price of ETH back to it's NAV.all DGD holders would immediately see a ~100% price appreciation!of course, if everyone did this, the DAO would be drained. so now what? pic.twitter.com/VslQGnWlebAs for the possibility of another DAO in the future, “if the team sees enough feedback from the community to create another DAO in the future,“ the FAQ states, “Digix will be open to explore all options that will both benefit the community and further develop the DGX ecosystem.“"

","As the community is learning about Block.one’s change of plans about blockchain on which their anticipated decentralized social media platform, Voice is to be launched, the price of EOS doesn’t seem to be affected.","The announcement in June 2019 clearly said that Voice will be launched on the EOS Public Blockchain. However, now the FAQ page states that: “While Voice is in beta and a highly iterative state, it will be run on a purpose-made EOSIO blockchain. In time, we would like Voice to leverage the EOS Public Blockchain, and potentially others that can meet the performance and governance demands of Voice.”As this has been developing and the news has been spreading through the Cryptoverse, the price of the eighth coin by total market capitalization, EOS, is not showing any major reactions as it has been moving in correlation with the rest of the market in the past few days. While it went through a drop of 1.5% in the past 24 hours, it’s up 14% in the past week. Overall, in the past month, the price appreciated 45%. It’s currently (11:25 UTC) standing at USD 3.57.Block.one is the publisher of EOSIO software, and the developer community has built a multitude of blockchains on EOSIO, such as the EOS Public Blockchain. It’s the community that maintains the EOS Public Blockchain, not Block.one.That said, the original announcement also states that “being built on the EOS Public Blockchain, which runs on the EOSIO protocol, means that interactions on Voice will be public, allows for transparency to be a core part of the experience. Everyone – the user, to the contributor, the platform – plays by the same rules. No hidden algorithms, no invisible interests.” To further cement that message, the first announcement also said that EOSIO will have an upgrade of its protocol, Version 2,  introducing EOS-VM update to the software to enable the processing of smart contracts 12 times faster than EOSIO 1.0, among other things. Indeed, on January 10, EOSIO 2 has been introduced.However, there have been several issues with EOS blockchain reported on recently, which may have had an influence on Block.one’s decision.In October 2019, prior to the upgrade, Blockchain developer contributing to EOSIO ecosystem, Jack Tanner, listed eight best and eight worst features of the blockchain. Among the worst, he listed 3-minutes block finality, 30-minutes transaction limits, incorrect RAM price, smart contract upgrade limitations, protocol upgrade centralization, unused inflation model. Also, he added that block producers not contributing to governance, and resource rate limits throttle the network and are unfair.In November, EOS dapp (decentralized app) EarnBet posted a note saying that, in its current, “sad” state, “the EOS blockchain is no place for dapps like EarnBet with commercial-scale aspirations.” Reasons given, among others, are intense network congestion and spam, which leaves users unable to access their EOS accounts; the network requires around 30 EOS (USD 106) staked to an account daily to perform a single transaction; and high effective EOS transaction fees.In either case, there are no explanations on Block.one’s, Voice’s, or EOS’s websites or social network accounts. We have contacted Block.one and Voice and will update the article should there be a response.As reported in June 2019, Block.one announced that it will be launching its own social network - a blockchain and crypto-based alternative to Facebook - called Voice, which would verify the identities of all accounts. A public beta is planned for launch on February 14. Block.one said in December that they’ve gotten “tens of thousands of sign-ups and counting”; Voice announced that it appointed Forbes’ global Chief Digital Officer, Salah Zalatimo, as Chief Executive Officer."

","Ethereum 2.0 will launch by the end of 2020, estimates Andrew Keys, a managing partner at investment firm Darma Capital and one of the first employees at Ethereum application developer ConsenSys. Meanwhile, the Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 that will be the base for the multi-client testnet is already out.","Ethereum's major network upgrade, Ethereum 2.0 (a.k.a. Serenity), should be rolled out in phases and will bring with it sharding, proof-of-stake (PoS), and a new virtual machine among other things “Proof of Stake Ethereum exists. It’s alive! The roadmap to Serenity is in full effect. 2020 will see Ethereum move stridently beyond Phase 0 of Ethereum 2.0, onto Phase 1 and the launch of shard chains. Then, it’s game on,” writes Keys in his blog post. As a reminder, the network went through Istanbul as its last upgrade as Ethereum 1.0, with the unplanned addition of the Muir Glacier update. Istanbul itself changed the underlying Ethereum protocol and created new rules to improve the system, with six relevant Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) chosen to be implemented. Ethereum is expected to launch phase zero of Serenity, which will trigger the switch from the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, used also by Bitcoin (BTC), to PoS (e.g., used by Tezos). Phase zero will bring forth Beacon Chain, followed by Shard Chains and State Execution in the subsequent phases.Keys says that Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, already released a block explorer for the Beacon Chain, which currently tracks a testnet version, and the process is rapidly moving towards Ethereum 2.0, also known as Serenity. “With the rollout of the Istanbul hard fork, Ethereum is on its way towards 2.0 levels of scalability at layer one,” Keys says.That said, though we know that Istanbul was the last step to phase zero, the date for this next phase is not clear and has been postponed from the end of 2019 already, at least according to the roadmap  provided by ConsenSys. In October, Buterin said it was months away. In December, Ethereum researcher Justin Drake suggested the fifth anniversary of Ethereum as the date (July of 2020), but the comments were not in favor of that suggestion, with people expecting other details to be worked out before setting a date, and others not wanting to delay the upgrade for an anniversary of any sorts.Nonetheless, while we await the exact date to be set, Eric Conner, a product researcher at blockchain startup Gnosis shared that Phase 0 spec v0.10.0 of Ethereum 2.0 has been released.Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 spec v0.10.0 has been released.This is the version that will now go to audit and be the base for the multi-client testnet. https://t.co/1bJK8Me1vXThe release includes EIP 1564, concerned with reorganization of files/directories, grouping files into fork-based directories. Additional changes include minor optimizations and cleanups, the release states. It adds: “v0.10.0 marks a stable target for Phase 0 for multi-client testnets and security reviews. We expect some revisions in February/March pending the results from each,” writes Danny Ryan, Ethereum 2.0 coordinator.Furthermore, Ben Edgington, researcher at ConsenSys, said in a note that this release is the basis for both testnets and an audit, while “the major, breaking, change in v0.10.0 is the long-anticipated update the BLS signature implementation that’s now being standardised.”Edgington also called Vitalik Butterin’s suggestion for accelerating the transition of the ETH 1.0 chain into the ETH 2.0 chain “the most potentially impactful proposal of the last couple of weeks.”There are a great number of other features that will be introduced or upgraded as phase 0 rolls out. In his latest blog post, Ethereum researcher Carl Beekhuizen explains rewards, punishments, and slashings for validators. Slashing a validator means destroying a portion of their stake if they act provably destructive. Slashing has two purposes, he says: to make it prohibitively expensive to attack Ethereum 2.0, and to stop validators from being lazy by checking that they actually perform their duties. The two major ways a validator can behave slashably maliciously within phase 0 are double voting and surround voting, as described in the original paper by Vitalik Buterin and Virgil Griffith. Additional rules are added in later phases to ensure that validators store and make available the shard data they sign.On the other hand, there are tree classes of rewards: whistleblower, proposer, and attester. Finally, there are two common approaches for paying validators in PoS systems: fixed rewards and fixed inflation, says Beekhuizen.Meanwhile, ETH is currently (14:15 UTC) trading at c. USD 143. The price dropped by 1% in a day, trimming its weekly gains to 1.5%.Also, check out the discussion with Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin on the future of Ethereum with eToro's Yoni Assia at Ethereal Tel Aviv 2019."

","Digital finance, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology-powered economics are sweeping through markets in the developing world unchallenged, say experts at the World Economic Forum in Davos.","Economists believe that rather than going shoulder-to-shoulder with banks and conventional financiers, fintech operations and cryptocurrency are booming in emerging markets. Digital disruption, they say is not even possible as no there is “no mature financial system to disrupt.”Keyu Jin, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics (LSE), stated,“In fact, digital services have actually filled in, rather than disrupted. China is one of the leading examples where a developing country has some of the leading technologies in fintech. And it is very clear that this very integrated system has helped reach rural areas, and helped small business owners.”Jin and others were speaking in a panel session entitled Shaping the Future of Financial and Monetary Systems, held at the annual forum in Davos on Tuesday.Panel members discussed the ways that digital disruption is currently reshaping the global financial services sector.Jin suggested that entire communities left out of the loop by conventional finance and banking could soon be making use of digital tokens rather than conventional bank-related alternatives.Developing economies, particularly in Asia, are increasingly looking toward digital alternatives to traditional finance in an effort to reach out to millions of unbanked individuals – using smartphone and blockchain technology.China is reportedly on the verge of releasing its digital yuan – but could be pipped at the post by Cambodia. The central National Bank of Cambodia is working with a Japanese blockchain developer on a digital finance solution targeted specifically at the 70%-80% of the population that is currently unbanked.Jin stated, “Countries like China, India and Brazil are big. They account for more than 50% of [global] GDP.” However, the LSE expert stated that the nations mentioned were not sufficiently “included in the international financial system.”Katherine Garrett-Cox, the chief executive officer of Gulf International Bank and the panel’s moderator, asked participants how openness brought about by digital disruption to financial and monetary systems could increase inclusiveness.Garrett-Cox also made note of the digital sector’s “inherent conflict” with the financial establishment, which is both highly regulated and controlled in its nature.Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, the American crypto firm that operates the USD Coin stablecoin, said,“Digital disruption in the financial system today has really been at the periphery. It’s been putting a new user interface on top of an existing system, basically, or lipstick on a pig.”Allaire opined that the world is now at an inflection point whereby financiers are “finally revisiting the very core of the financial system.” The Circle chief stated that experts were now “looking at the very nature of money,” and looking at the way it is issued and distributed.Allaire claimed that driving factors in recent developments included “an alliance by some of the largest technology companies in the world.” He made reference to “a stablecoin project that will reach billions of people” – most likely meaning Facebook’s Libra project.State-backed initiatives could also propel digital tokens to success, including what he termed a “stable value cryptocurrency” to be launched this year by “massive national sovereigns such as China.” Bankers on the panel conceded that digital solutions were very much in the ascendancy.Michael Corbat, CEO of Citigroup, said the world was at the “very early stages of writing the next chapter of banking,” admitting “That chapter is entirely digital.” However, Corbat claimed, “I think that what some people miss in banking is that this analog to digital transformation is not the standing start of a new industry.”Meanwhile, the panel also had its say on regulation in the fintech industry. Allaire said, “I think that it’s key not to overregulate early.”And the Circle CEO added,“Regulators are now stepping in. I think that with technical innovation in the financial system there is this tradeoff: how do we allow for the same kind of arc of innovation that took place in other Internet industries [such as] retail, transportation, media and communication […] knowing that there are going to be negative externalities?”

","In a few months, Cambodians might be able to start using a blockchain-based ""national payment gateway.""","Chea Serey, the director-general of the National Bank of Cambodia, told The Phnom Penh Post that peer-to-peer payment and money transfer platform dubbed ‘Project Bakong’ was launched on a trial basis in July and is already supported by 11 banks even before it becomes operational in a few months.The director-general stated that the plan is to have the “quasi-form of a central bank digital currency (CBDC)” function as the national payment gateway for the country. The digital currency is designed to allow Cambodians throughout the nation to effectively and quickly complete transactions, regardless of their banking institution. Moreover, the central banks hopes to allow cross border payment through the Bakong system too.The current payment climate can often be very complex, with local merchants being required to hold accounts at a host of banks, or to take only cash in order to make payments simple. The move toward a new type of a digital currency might expedite payment processes, and allow merchants to use only one payment processing system. However, naysayers believe that the centralized nature of the payment platform will cause banks to lose market share. Phnom Penh Commercial Bank (PPCBank) president Shin Chang Moo, however, feels that the risk is worth the reward. “Bakong will eventually create financially inclusive ecosystems that all the stakeholders in the industry can benefit from,” the president was quoted as saying.Meanwhile, as reported, around 7 undisclosed central banks, representing 20% of the world’s population, are likely to launch CBDCs in 3 years, a new survey by the Bank for International Settlements, showed.Also, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier in January, Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President at the European Commission, said that Brussels also recognizes there are now financial “needs that are unaddressed, including fast, convenient and cheap cross-border payments.”"

",Blockchain industry participants in Davos believe that digital tokens could transform the world of business and art – providing the capacity to “break down an Andy Warhol painting into a million different tokens.”,"The industry professionals were speaking at a session entitled “From Token Assets to a Token Economy,” held at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.Panelists agreed that tokenization has the potential to make illiquid assets more accessible on a global scale. They also claimed such moves could democratize access to capital for business owners worldwide, but said that only regulation could mitigate the emergence of new token-associated financial risks.Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of America’s Circle, the operator of the USD Coin stablecoin, said that both dollars and gold have already been tokenized, and will be followed by “more complex types of assets” – namely valuable works of art, the earnings of spots stars and tokenized carbon credits.Allaire spoke about the potential of bringing an “unprecedented level of democracy” in terms of access to capital for global business owners.He stated,“Capital markets are very efficient, but the [number of people] who participate in them is very limited. It’s basically thousands of companies out of millions of companies. The ability to access capital as a start-up, entrepreneur […] is limited.”Neha Narula, the Director of the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT, said that tokenization allows a “much cheaper, much faster” way to “break down a Warhol [painting] into a million different tokens […] and to do that for thousands of paintings around the world”.Narula conceded that a number of challenges could block such tokenization drives from coming to fruition.She elaborated, saying,“We want to have consumer protection. We want to have market integrity. People who are issuing assets should disclose information about what exactly these assets represent.”The MIT director added that stakeholders want to make sure that tokens are “really tied to their representation in the real world.” She said, “This requires some amount of regulation. I think we’re still writing that law for the tokenized asset world.”

","The bitter, public war-of-words between the co-founders of the IoT-focused IOTA Foundation has taken a new turn, with Sergey Invancheglo taking to Twitter to announce that he will launch legal proceedings against fellow co-founder David Sønstebø.","Invancheglo appears to have accused Sønstebø of withholding some USD 8.5 million worth of IOTA’s MIOTA tokens from him.Invancheglo wrote,“I notify the IOTA community that I no longer work with David Sønstebø and am contacting my lawyers to get my 25 Ti [meaning unspecified] from him. He refuses to transfer the Iotas to make me act for his own benefit and against mine.”The news had a surprising effect on the MIOTA token, which promptly rallied after Invancheglo’s tweet. At 14:24 UTC, the token's value was up by 10% on the past 24 hours, standing at USD 0.338.The spat began in June last year, when Ivancheglo stepped down from IOTA’s Board of Directors. Ivancheglo is currently working on a number of projects, including Jinn, Qubic, Aigarth and the Paracosm Platform.Following his departure, he was quoted on the official IOTA blog as saying that he no longer believed the IOTA Foundation was “the best setting” for him to realize what he and Sønstebø had “set out to create back in 2014 and 2015.”He added,“I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.”At first, it seemed that the split would be amicable. Sønstebø commented at that time he continued to “fully trust” his former partner, adding that nothing would “change in terms of the development of the big picture.”However, recent events have proven that there has indeed been bad blood between the two. A Twitter user posted a Discord message  from Sønstebø, who appears to have replied to Invancheglo’s most recent allegations by stating he and Ivancheglo had last week agreed “to part ways amicably and professionally.”But Sønstebø says his former business partner “got cold feet” at the “last minute.”He also accused Ivancheglo of reneging on an agreement to post a joint “transparent” “letter to the community,” and said he would not be drawn into “immature troll games.”In response, Ivancheglo again took to Twitter to write that he did not “see [his ex-partner’s] comments about him planning to keep all the assets of Jinn for himself” and, thus, didn’t “recommend [trusting] him with money.” The catfighting continued with Sønstebø penning an open letter to the IOTA community on Medium in which he says that, up “until just a week ago,” he was “still trying to talk sense [to Ivancheglo], to no avail.” Sønstebø wrote,“I know a lot of people will continue to ask me questions about him, but please respect that I am removing him entirely from my private and professional life and will not entertain his trolling for one second. I will not engage in ad hominem attacks on him and ignore all attempts at baiting me into expressing further sentiments about him. I wish him good luck with Paracosm and Jinn, and that’s that.”Invancheglo has not yet responded to a Cryptonews.com request for comment.Sønstebø ended his letter by claiming it was his “catharsis and final word on this entire debacle.” Only time will tell if he will stay true to his word."

",Japan’s Finance Minister Taro Aso has warned bankers in the country of potential problems caused by China’s forthcoming digital yuan launch – hinting that a Beijing-issued digital fiat could cause a rift between Tokyo and Washington.,"Per Reuters, Aso told a summit of Japanese bankers that China will likely seek to make international payments in its new digital currency – intimating that Washington would likely to take a dim view of countries choosing to use the digital yuan in place of the dollar in international trade deals.Aso pointed out that Japan, a member of the Group of Seven (G7), overwhelmingly uses the USD for international trade, and warned that the digital yuan could thus pose a “huge problem” for Japan’s traders and exporters.Bilateral trade between China and Japan increased by 8.1% in 2018, per Ministry of Commerce statistics released in summer last year.Aso warned that the United States and China could enter a “new Cold War,” and warned that in the year ahead,“In the United States, anti-China sentiment will be unilateral in both the House and Senate.”The remarks were Aso’s first on the digital yuan, although the minister has spoken out on both cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in the past.Meanwhile, the South China Morning Post reports that the central People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has said it made “smooth progress” on its digital fiat in 2019, but stopped short of announcing when the digital yuan would first see the light of day. The PBOC instead insisted it would “continue with its research and development” into the digital yuan in the year ahead – despite claims in the Chinese press that the central bank is on the verge of launching two testbeds for the digital yuan in conjunction with state-run telecoms operators and banks."

","Cardano (ADA) is once again making headlines after its price rallied over 8% in the past 24 hours, making it today’s best-performing coin among the top 10 crypto assets. ","As of pixel time (12:58 PM UTC), ADA is trading at USD 0.055 per coin and is also up by almost 22% in a week.Among the possible reasons for the recent strong performance of ADA is an announcement made by Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson on Monday about the commercialization of the project. In a live stream posted on YouTube, Hoskinson said that IOHK, the Cardano development firm he heads, has engaged major consulting firm PwC to be “the moderator” for the company’s efforts to create a “consolidated unified commercial strategy” across Cardano’s venture capital arm Emurgo, IOHK, and the Cardano Foundation. “Starting in February, PwC is going to start doing a lot of prep work […] to create a consolidated strategy for Cardano,” Hoskinson said in the live stream.However, further commercialization of the project is not the only thing Cardano currently has going for itself. In fact, Charles Hoskinson and other members of the Cardano team returned back from the World Economic Forum in Davos just this week after delivering a series of interviews and speeches in front of the world’s financial elite.Although the exact impact of the exposure in Davos is unknown, it may have helped spread awareness about the project among traditionally-minded investors, including awareness about upcoming milestones for Cardano.Last week, Cardano also made headlines after news came out that Emurgo was setting up a “strategic task force” with the government of Uzbekistan, which was said “to lead the development of a legal framework for security token offerings (STOs) and exchanges (STXs)” in the country.ADA price chart:"

It’s bad for innovators who want to invest in this space. So that would be my priority, it’s just clear and transparent rules so that everyone knows where they can head in the future and that we can maintain competitiveness.”Yang, who has previously voiced his support for cryptocurrency-related ventures on numerous occasions, added that he considered “the underlying technology of cryptocurrency” to be “very, very high potential,” and added that the United States “should be investing in” the cryptocurrency industry.Yang also opined that crypto’s progress is now unavoidable, and stated that the industry could not now be stymied wit regulation even “if you tried”.Yang has included a number of cryptocurrency-related election manifesto pledges as he continues his bid to run against President Donald Trump in November this year.In his manifesto, Yang claimed that “states have come up with a patchwork of varying regulations that make it difficult for American cryptocurrency markets to compete with those in other jurisdictions, especially China and Europe.”His team wrote,“Different departments of the federal government consider digital assets as property, commodities or securities. Some states have onerous regulations in the space, such as New York’s BitLicense. Navigating this has had a chilling effect on the American digital asset market,” Yang wants to implement “clear guidelines” that will help crypto ventures and investors “proceed with all relevant information.”"

",America appears to be the latest country to have had a change of heart on the matter of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs ) – with the head of the central Federal Reserve suggesting that a “digital dollar” may well be in the pipelines.,"In a speech prepared for the Stanford Graduate School of Business in California, the Fed governor Lael Brainard said, per Bloomberg,“Given the dollar’s important role, it is essential that we remain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding [CBDCs]. We are conducting research and experimentation related to distributed ledger technologies and their potential use case for digital currencies, including the potential for a CBDC.”Brainard listed “some of the issues that would need to be addressed” before deciding to launch a CBDC in the United States, stating that a digital dollar would need to “reduce costs and operational vulnerabilities.”The Fed would also want to address questions about the “kinds of banks or financial firms that would offer CBDC accounts” and regulatory issues.And the Fed says it wants to examine potential CBDC-related “financial stability risks.”Of late, a number of international organizations, ranging from the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund to the G7 have asked central banks around the world to conduct studies into the feasibility of releasing a CBDC digital currencies.The organizations say that central banks need to respond to “big tech”-led global stablecoin drives, such as Facebook’s Libra project.And Brainard conceded that the social media company had sparked the Fed into CBDC-related action.She said,“Because Facebook has an active user network of one-third of the global population, [Libra] has imparted urgency to the debate over what form money can take, who or what can issue it, and how payments can be recorded and settled.”Earlier this week, reports in South Korea claimed that the central Bank of Korea’s recent decision to look into CBDC issuance had been motivated by China’s rapid progress on its digital yuan project.The Chinese project is widely expected to roll out sometime in 2020.

","DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols to face the same challenge as all cryptos on their path in 2020, and it’s organic user adoption.","The growing trend of DeFi, which marked 2019, has in fact been highlighted by a large increase in the number of assets being locked up in different DeFi protocols. However, a potential challenge facing DeFi protocols will be related to organic user adoption, according to financial technology and data company Digital Assets Data (DAD).Organic growth, in general, refers to the growth rate achieved by increasing output, expanding the customer base, increasing sales internally, etc. ""Adoption is a challenge for all of crypto,"" Brandon Anderson, Data Science Lead at DAD told Cryptonews.com. ""We would like to see protocols in this space have growth throughout the whole range of address sizes. We are currently doing additional research to separate these accounts into categories that will allow us to see things on a more granular level."" Following their analysis of Maker's  Dai Stablecoin System and the current distributions, the company concluded that the majority of assets being locked and borrowed in the DeFi space is actually the responsibility of just ""a few addresses."" Some 155,000 Collateral Debt Positions (CDP's) were created on the old version of the Maker protocol, while 77% of these positions with positive amounts locked held less than ETH 0.05. As a reminder, MakerDAO is the creator of a decentralized stablecoin Dai, which is stabilized against the value of the U.S. dollar and backed by crypto collaterals that can be viewed publicly on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables others to stake their crypto as collateral in order to borrow the stablecoin. In November 2019, as reported, MakerDAO system has seen the activation of Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) that can be backed by multiple assets. Therefore, the single-collateral Dai generated with only ETH became Sai, while the MCD took on the name Dai. This also means that each asset has its own CDP or vault, and DAD found that some 3,500 vaults have been created in the new system. “However, these accounts in the lower tier of vaults appear to be actual adopters with more than 1 ETH being locked into the accounts,” said Anderson.According to DAD, there is one address that maintains 27% of the value locked in CDP's on the old version, while “the new Vaults system has a similar distribution, with one address holding 15% of the value locked.”MakerDAO's Dai Stability system still dominates the space, as it boasts more than USD 400 million in assets locked up, additionally being at an all-time high in the number of ETH locked up, which is some 2.5 million, or about 2.2% of the total supply, according to Digital Assets Data. On the other hand, due to ETH’s price drop, the USD value locked dwindled from its all-time high of c. USD 500 million recorded in June. The company finds a key question for 2019 to be: will MakerDAO continue its dominance, or will investors move to other protocols that provide higher yields?As to what can be done to surpass the adoption challenge, Anderson said that: The applications these protocols are building are making interaction with the Ethereum network easier to use. This ease of use might provide better on-ramps for other individuals who may not want to deal with the technical burdens. As these applications continue to evolve and more users join a given protocol, you could see an increase in smaller accounts, potentially an increase in large accounts that see it as a solid investment.According to him, adoption of DeFi protocols can result in more demand for ETH in order to interact with these contracts (i.e. to lock values up or to transfer value between them). ""This provides a greater value proposition for ETH as well as the protocol tokens that are being adopted,"" the Data Science Lead said.Meanwhile, a Dapp.com report found in October 2019 that dapps (decentralized applications) are experiencing “huge growth,” with Ethereum-powered services leading the way. Ethereum-powered DeFi dapps picked up 310,000 new users in Q3 2019, which was the largest quarter-on-quarter growth rate. Maker dominance rate on the DeFi scene, was almost 51% in early October, per DeFi Pulse, whereas that number now is 57%. Total value of funds locked in DeFi apps at the time of writing (12:04 UTC) is USD 856.9 million, down from yesterday’s all-time high of USD 893.8 million, out of which USD 493 million is in Maker.

","Major adult entertainment website Pornhub  has added Tether (USDT) to its payment options, while Tron's Justin Sun can also score another adoption victory.
(Updated on January 27, 15:55 UTC, updates in bold.)","The addition of the popular stablecoin has been announced  just recently, explaining what stablecoins and Tether are to the users unaware of it. Furthermore, given the Tron - Tether partnership, says the site, they can now offer the option of using the TRONLink cryptocurrency wallet for USDT transactions. The site provided a step-by-step explanation on how to download and set up the wallet to send and receive USDT.Pornhub is not new to crypto, as it started accepting Verge (XVG) in 2018, which is a rebranded version of Dogecoindark and which in 2014 split off from Dogecoin. ""Since PayPal’s decision to stop payouts to thousands of Models two months ago, we’ve been hustling to start the new year on a good note and offer you more options to make things a little easier,"" says Pornhub.In November last year, major payments company PayPal stopped model payouts to Pornhub, telling Cryptonews.com that following a review, they've discovered that PornHub ""has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission,"" so the giant said the transactions were halted.Pornhub, however, found itself with a major payment option down, calling the move discriminatory. But they also told Cryptonews.com at the time that they've been looking into adding other crypto options besides Verge for paying their models. Many members of the crypto community offered their suggestions to Pornhub at the time - Tron's Justin Sun among them, who said that they need to add USDT-TRC20 supports too.After November, several payment methods for the models were still available, and the website saw ""a significant increase in payouts in Verge, which informed our decision to add another cryptocurrency to our roster of sex worker friendly payout methods,"" said Pornhub in an emailed statement to Cryptonews.com today.Sun tweeted today as well, announcing this latest development and saying ""If you’re on @Pornhub, stop what you’re doing.""If you’re on @Pornhub, stop what you’re doing. #USDT is now an option for models on Pornhub! Pornhub is using USDT-TRON to support models seeking payment solutions. This is a brilliant way to support the victims of centralized payment platforms like PayPal. #TRON #TRX https://t.co/qwpMf0LgmSThe response to the USDT option and the TRONLink wallet option has been positive so far, said Pornhub. As to why they chose Tether, the website explained that it's ""because it is stable and backed by traditional fiat currency, which is the first crypto of this type we are offering to our models, as a part of a larger goal to offer numerous and flexible payment options,"" adding that they're ""constantly evaluating sex worker friendly payout methods that are flexible and secure.""Meanwhile, at the time of writing (10:40 UTC), TRX is trading at USD 0.016. It's gone down 4.5% in a day and is unchanged in a week. Similarly, Verge is changing hands at USD 0.003, having dropped 4.7% in a day and 5% in a week."
