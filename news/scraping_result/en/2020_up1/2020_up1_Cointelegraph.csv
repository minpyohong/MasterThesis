For regular Cointelegraph contributor filbfilb, despite Bitcoin’s bullish overall movements, the next close would be crucial in determining short-term trajectory. Specifically, if BTC/USD were to close below the bullish candle, which took it to current highs, the chance of a bearish reversal would be on the table. The price under such circumstances would then paint a so-called swing failure pattern, or SFP, which in turn may keep the pair lower.“When price pierces above a key swing high but then closes back below that swing high, we have a potential bearish SFP,” he summarized in private comments to Cointelegraph.In addition, the 200-day moving average, which has served as major resistance for the past two years, is also hovering around the low $9Ks. Thus, it will likely present a critical barrier for the bulls if a run-up to $10,000 is to occur. Bitcoin price vs. 200-day moving average, 2018-present.

sentiment around the recent Bitcoin rally remains divided amongst investors.","Feb 9, 2020","Since Dec. 18, 2019, in less than three months, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price surged by 68% against the United States dollar. It surpassed the $10,000 level on Feb. 9, marking the start of a full-blown crypto market rally for most.","The sentiment around the recent Bitcoin rally remains divided amongst investors. Joe007, for instance, one of the biggest whales in the cryptocurrency market, has been adamant that the upsurge has been a result of pure manipulation.Other investors like Adaptive Capital general partner Willy Woo and Three Arrows Capital CEO Su Zhu said that both fundamental and technical factors have supported the rally since the beginning. When Bitcoin’s price was hovering at around $7,000, Zhu noted that the premium of the BTC/USDT pair indicated an accumulation phase was starting particularly in Asia.While the explanations for the recent Bitcoin upsurge vary, they ultimately can be narrowed down to three broad factors: accumulation since December 2019, on-chain data indicating a rise in investor activity and a possible manipulation by whales.On Dec. 28, 2019, Zhu stated that the BTC/USDT premium suggest investors were accumulating, and Bitcoin’s price could hit $9,000 by the end of January:“BTC/USDT premiums and price action show clear signs of accumulation and money flow back into risk. Would not surprise me to see 9K+ before the end of Jan.”At the time, Bitcoin’s price was hovering at $7,200, and at the end of January, as predicted by Zhu, its price peaked at $9,500. When the BTC/USDT pair was showing a premium over spot, it meant that the demand for Tether and Bitcoin was on the rise.According to cryptocurrency research firm Diar, the majority of the on-chain activity of Tether in mid-2019 occurred in China. The volume of Tether coming from Chinese exchanges was substantially higher than exchanges in the West. The report read:“On-chain data shows Tether movements hitting a new all-time-high for 2Q19 with one month left on the calendar for the period. What is most striking, however, is the volume coming in and out of Chinese exchanges dwarfs western and global trading venues and accounts for more than half of the total transaction value of known parties.”Based on the premium of the BTC/USDT pair and China accounting for the overwhelming majority of Tether’s on-chain activity, it can be reasonably deduced that many investors in Asia were accumulating in the final months of 2019.The gradual accumulation heading into 2020 was expected to be dominated by the narrative around the scheduled Bitcoin reward halving set to occur in May, established a strong foundation for an extended rally.Since Bitcoin’s price was in the mid-$9,000 range, Joe007 has consistently said that the rally is manipulated by fake buy walls and spoof orders. After Bitcoin’s price hit $10,000, the Bitcoin whale wrote:“I'm all in for a good old BTC parabolic, but I'd like to cash out in the end. But it's not possible if the price is pumped up by overleveraged players in the face of low liquidity and weak fiat inflow.”The main argument behind Joe007’s statement is that the recent upsurge was triggered by other whales placing spoof orders across margin trading platforms to inorganically pump the price of Bitcoin up.In margin trading, a spoof order is a fake buy order of a large size created to lead others into buying into the market with the intent of pushing the price up. When the price goes up, the order disappears, hence the term “spoof.”While the Bitcoin rally started out as manipulation from whales, considering the consistency in the emergence of spoof orders every time the dominant cryptocurrency showed a sign of a pullback, it remains unclear whether the movement to $10,000 and above is also being manipulated.Simply put, what began as manipulation can turn organic if retail investors start to get involved and invest into the market out of fear of missing out. Throughout the entire run from the low $8,000s to $10,000, short sellers continue to place pressure on the market with large sell orders in the $9,000-to-$10,000 range.As Bitcoin’s price increased, it squeezed short contracts and pushed short sellers to market buy, which then turned into buying demand that further led BTC to spike. Speaking about Bitcoin reclaiming the psychological $10,000 level, a cryptocurrency analyst known as Light said:“Markets seek liquidity. There are hundreds of millions in stops, liquidations and trigger orders hiding right above it. The prize is too great not to be taken. There is no real material sum of spot sellers who waited this long just to sell just before this leg's climax.”The lack of fiat inflow has been described as the missing piece of the upside movement of Bitcoin from the $6,000s to $10,000. But, in the past several days, exchanges like Binance have started to see some inflow that may provide BTC the basis it needs to initiate an extended upsurge.Willy Woo, who has created various indicators that take both fundamental and technical factors of Bitcoin into consideration to predict its trends, said that the chance of $10,000 being the top is basically zero. To explain the point, Woo showed a chart with the price of Bitcoin alongside on-chain investor activity.Caption: Bitcoin on-chain investor activity. Source: Willy Woo TwitterThe Realised Value to Transaction Volume ratio, for instance, is used as a signal to find market bottoms and tops. When Bitcoin’s price reached $14,000 last year, the RVT ratio hit nearly 0.04. As of Feb. 10, the RVT ratio is hovering at around 0.018, which shows Bitcoin’s price is unlikely to have topped. The ratio peaked at 0.12 when Bitcoin’s price hit $20,000 in December 2017.The Bitcoin’s rally from $6,400 to $10,000 is likely to have begun as manipulation from whales, based on the frequency and the consistency of spoof orders. However, it might have picked up retail interest, especially as investors in Asia began to accumulate Bitcoin in anticipation of the block reward halving that will occur in about three months.Although Bitcoin’s price is currently hovering at around $10,100, technical indicators do not show overbought conditions nor signs of a local top, which could allow BTC to move up further before it pulls back."

Source: LocalBitcoinsHowever, the apparent staggering premium in Iran relative to the current global market price may only exist on the surface. In reality, it is not uncommon for countries with weak national currencies — such as Venezuela — to have dual exchange rates: one “official” rate set by the country’s central bank and the other, the actual market rate, or the real amount of dollars a regular person would get for their rials. “It’s only possible for few businesses and government with special procedure to get that rate,” explained a crypto expert Ali Beikverdi.“The official rate is what the central bank says. But literally, no one except some government organizations can get that rate while no one can use it. It’s a joke.”“So if you wanna buy USD today in Tehran, the price is about 140,000 IRR,” he says.In other words, while the “official rate” is around 42,000 IRR per 1 USD — which would result in the $24,000 price per Bitcoin — the actual rate in the street would give one something closer to BTC’s actual global market price, currently around $7,300 USD. As Cointelegraph reported, an airstrike at Baghdad's airport ordered by United States President Donald Trump killed the head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, General Qasem Soleimani. This has led to a surge in global oil prices as well as Bitcoin rebounding from weekly lows of around $6,850. Meanwhile, looking at the BTC rates on LocalBitcoin in Iran, founder of crypto analytics outlet Messari Ryan Selkis mistakingly noted that there is now a huge premium as a result. He wrote: “Bitcoin is trading at nearly $24,000 in the USD equivalent of Iranian Rials on LocalBitcoins today. It's unlikely those purchases are paying for the Iranian military's response. Instead, it might be innocent (and desperate) Iranians looking for a way out of the coming chaos.”But given the dual exchange rate reality in Iran, it is likely that no one is actually paying this much per Bitcoin.“There is a slight increase in dollar price today from what I see in the local market but that’s about it,” adds Beikverdi.At the same time, reported trading volumes on LocalBitcoins have hit rock bottom in recent months. This is likely due to Iran’s government restricting internet access across the country since November amid nationwide protests in response to rising fuel prices. LocalBitcoins weekly trading volume, Iran. Source: Coin.danceMeanwhile, Iran vowed to seek revenge on the U.S. on Friday following the killing of Soleimani, NBC News reported.Last month, Cointelegraph reported that Iran was proposing a Muslim cryptocurrency as one of a number of means to confront the economic dominance of the United States.“The Muslim world should be designing measures to save themselves from the domination of the United States dollar and the American financial regime,” said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.Nevertheless, Iran holds an unfavorable position on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general as authorities have offered a bounty to anyone who exposes unauthorized mining operations in the country."

Anthony Pompliano, co-founder & partner at Morgan Creek Digital believes that Bitcoin’s price can hit $100,000 at the end of 2021 due to limited supply and increased demand:“Bitcoin just hit $10,000. I still think that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 by end of December 2021.Fixed supply. Increasing demand. Time will tell.“This has been significant news to the Bitcoin holders as crypto analyst Willy Woo commented earlier today on Twitter:“This breakout is the real deal. Fundamental investment activity is backing this $10k breakout.” Source: charts.woobull.comArthur Hayes, Co-Founder & CEO of BitMEX also holds a bullish view regarding the future price of the Bitcoin. He commented on twitter: “Nothing can stop me, I’m all the way up! Slow and steady wins the race. Let’s take the staircase up to #bitcoin $20k.”Bitcoin has numerous attributes that are vital to its success. It’s deflationary monetary policy; certain and predictable with a hard cap. In many ways it can also be compared to gold, since Bitcoin must be mined via digital means and also has a limited and finite supply.There are only 21 million Bitcoin in total that can be mined. About 18 million Bitcoin have been extracted already. Bitcoin halving is going to happen in May this year where its supply will be reduced even further to a rate of around 1.7% per annum.Since 2010, Bitcoin has shown high price volatility, spurring a debate regarding the underlying reasons that lead economic agents to demand it. Most of the public, in the short term, have seen Bitcoin as an asset for speculation. Bitcoin price also surged at the beginning of a U.S.-China trade war earlier last year.Many people have turned their stocks; fiat currency and assets to Bitcoin while looking for a safe haven. In the long term, the demand might be driven by Bitcoin’s near future expectations as a medium of exchange.Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe tweeted that Bitcoin price has reached a temporary high and expected to have a pull back in some point:“Still, I think we're going to top out for a bit here and just make a sideways range. Identical, the best would be $8,750-9,000 as long entries. Doubt we'll get it...breakthrough here and targeting $10,400-10,900.”"

It wasn’t just cutting edge technology - it was bleeding edge! You just felt the energy in the air. That this was the real deal. Everyone felt united in this cause — this mission. Those were some of the most beautiful moments of my life.”Finman made headlines over the past several years for his success as a young Bitcoiner. Finman invested $1,000 into BTC in 2011, turning him into a millionaire by the age of 18 due to Bitcoin’s dramatic price increases, Cointelegraph detailed in June 2017. In late 2018, however, Finman expressed his thoughts on Bitcoin’s eventual demise based on several factors, including community infighting, etc. The atmosphere seen in Bitcoin’s early days is now gone, Finman told Cointelegraph. Adding to his reminiscence of the asset’s beginnings, he noted:“[T]hose times of ‘unity’ & ‘cutting edge’ technology seem to be left in the past. I really care about Bitcoin - but the community can’t seem to get it together in my opinion. I’ve tried to get involved within the community to fix it - but it was very hostile. There is still wonderful people in the community and incredibly smart people working on the technology problem.”A popular opinion in the crypto space sees Bitcoin hitting a $100,000 price tag at some point.   Finman sees no real chance for a $100,000 or $1 million Bitcoin if the community does not change, barring any drastic global disruptions, he explained.  “Even if the world were to destabilize, Bitcoin isn’t necessarily THE CRYPTOCURRENCY for people to put their money in, in a time like that,” he said, noting Monero and Zcash as potentially better options.Relating the situation to the death of a popular social media entity, Finman added, “Bitcoin is the next MySpace if the community can’t make drastic changes.”Finman has been in the Bitcoin game a considerable length of time, so his comments carry weight. Finman first invested in Bitcoin at the age of 12, so his views on the overall situation in 2011 may have differed from adults who bought it at the same time.Several data points do, however, line up with Finman’s comments on community disagreements, including the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork in 2017, and the birth of Bitcoin maximalism.Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also expressed issues with Bitcoin. “One of the biggest problems with Bitcoin, [...] is that it’s blind, deaf and dumb and that was by design,” Hoskinson said in October 2019 in an interview on Anthony Pompliano’s Off the Chain podcast."

An example is found after the push to $10,000 in November 2019.The chart is also showing a clear breakout from the 7-month downtrend. A retest was done at $7,600, after which the price of Bitcoin rallied towards $9,200 for temporary resistance.BTC USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart of Bitcoin is showing a healthy support/resistance flip at $8,200, after which price broke through the $8,500 resistance. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is facing the next resistance at $8,800.However, it’s quite unlikely to see an immediate breakthrough at this level as the indicators on smaller time frames show exhaustion of this upwards move.Additionally, some significant resistances are shown on the chart, i.e. $9,000 and $9,200-9,400, which are two hurdles to overcome if the price of Bitcoin wants to continue moving upwards.On the support side, a retest of $8,500 looks quite healthy for confirmation of new support. Range-bound movements are now likely to happen if price can’t break through $8,800 or drop below $8,500.Total market capitalization cryptocurrency chart. Source: TradingViewThe total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies is showing an essential bounce from the blue zone (level around $217-218 billion). A retest there was quite healthy as anticipated in a recent article.This retest is now completed and shows intense buying pressure as the total market capitalization has already rallied up to $238 billion. This retest also indicates confirmation of the uptrend with the total market cap breaking the 7-month downtrend as well.The first hurdle to overcome now is the $247 billion level. If that is broken, continuation towards $270 and $300 billion is likely to occur.The total market capitalization chart of altcoins is looking healthy The market cap rallied from $52 billion to $80 billion. Only a slight retracement occurred to $71 billion, which means that it is stuck in a narrow range.Total altcoin market capitalization chart. Source: TradingViewIf we check the rest of the chart, we can spot many tests of the $80 billion level in recent months. Around three tests have happened prior to this latest one, which means that the resistance should become weaker.Remember, the more times a resistance gets tested, the more exhausted sellers will get, and the weaker a resistance becomes. On the other hand, this also happens with support zones. The $6,000 support of Bitcoin in 2018 was tested many times before it broke down.Given that these tests of the $80 billion level occurred quite frequently, a breakout to the upside is the most likely scenario at this point, meaning that the altcoin market cap could rally towards $120 billion.BTC USDT 4-hour chart bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe most bullish scenario would be a clear breakout of $8,800 and a continuation from there. However, as stated earlier, I find it unlikely to see such a move occur in one go.A retest and consolidation would be more likely including a likely retest of the $8,500. This is healthy and would be almost required before the price of Bitcoin can continue to face higher resistance levels.If Bitcoin can hold the $8,500 area for support, I see a breakthrough of the $8,800 and $9,000 as likely, after which $10,000 will become the primary target. Moreover, clearing $10,000 could bring the price of Bitcoin towards $11,000 as well.BTC USDT 4-hour chart bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewTypically, the bearish scenario has a similar pattern in the beginning, as BTC needs to be rejected at the $8,800 level. However, the difference is in the subsequent pattern.If the price of Bitcoin is to make lower highs with weak bounces, the downward trend is likely to resume. If this occurs, I’d be aiming for bearish retest (support/resistances flips) of the $8,500 level as a potential short opportunity. The main target would then be the $7,600 area.But first, the price needs to be rejected at $8,800-9,000 to get these scenarios going. Overall, the $8,100 support/resistance flip doesn’t say that we’re bearish at this point. Especially, since that price has broken at a 7-month downtrend.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Notably, the report cited two random Twitter accounts dedicated to altcoin XRP as sources.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin has long exhibited increasingly strong technical fundamentals, which preceded recent price moves. Discussing the impact of coronavirus, trader Tone Vays nonetheless stopped short of agreeing with the idea that the disease could perpetually fuel further gains. If it were to spread internationally, for example, panicked investors would likely reduce speculative activity, meaning less interest in non-traditional assets such as Bitcoin. On the latest episode of his Trading Bitcoin YouTube series, Vays told viewers:“The coronavirus does bring some economic fear, so the fear that the coronavirus could start to spread is certainly helping the rise of Bitcoin versus hurting the rise of Bitcoin.”Vays also noted that Bitcoin would need to stay above $9,000 for several days to cement its recent bullish gains.Google search data for “coronavirus” and “Bitcoin.” Source: Google TrendsMeanwhile, data from Google Trends appears to underscore the lack of correlation between the crisis and Bitcoin, with search interest in the latter remaining comparatively flat throughout the past month."

Clearly, this will be important to watch in the coming weeks. BTC USD Weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe spot volume for BTC/USD has been in decline since the climactic selloff in June 2019. It is notable that the most significant weeks of volume have all been supporting a move higher. The moving average convergence divergence indicator, or MACD, has been showing divergence on its histogram since October but requires a bullish signal cross to confirm it.Given where the MACD is, this would most likely coincide with it crossing its zero line, which would add confluence to it being bullish. Until this occurs, however, this remains an unconfirmed signal.BTC USD Weekly chart.

There is a hint of a general descending diagonal resistance in price but selloffs have been met by buying interest so far resulting in a sideways action.Should the price of Bitcoin break down at this point, it seems likely that there would be a response around the 61.8% level of the bounce last week, which would potentially lead to a higher low between $7,800-$7,900.Failure to find support here would lead to Bitcoin painting an Inverted Adam and Eve topping pattern, which would put downward pressure on previous support, suggesting that demand may need to be retested back at $7,000.BTC USD 4-hour chart.

One thing to note is the volume on the futures contract was largest during the most recent bounce backtesting the mid $7,000s. Volume overall is in decline through this period of consolidation and looks likely to be reaching a pivotal point within the next 24 hours.The premium has now settled to around $50 above the spot price, having been as high as $180 at the highs last week, meaning the market has returned to a more modest state of contango, which is a healthier outlook. The BitMEX funding rate is also above zero, which generally has an inverse relationship with price as a leading indicator. Despite this, it is by no means near the overheated levels seen at market tops.BTC USD 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe picture is fairly clear for Bitcoin. Previous horizontal resistance has been broken and the bulls need to turn this now into support. There is a debate about whether Bitcoin has broken out of its diagonal resistance so this will remain a key point of contention, which many are looking towards as a sign of a definitive change in trend.Breaking above key moving averages, supported by a local trend change in volume, paints a positive picture. But failure to capitalize on the early 2020 gains could see the bears reclaim control and take Bitcoin to new lows.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Source: Coin360.comBTC USD monthly chart. Source: TradingViewIn my Jan. 12 analysis I wrote that my greatest concern was the bearish nature of the monthly chart. At the time the moving average divergence convergence (MACD) indicator was sitting on its first red candle of the MACD histogram, however, all other major time frames such as the weekly and daily were looking bullish.  Despite these concerns, I made a case that a new bull market could be ushered in, should the price hold above $8,500 over a period of around 2-3 weeks, as this would inherently change the dynamic of the charts.  Now that three weeks have passed investors are likely more exciting than disappointed. The new month started yesterday and with it came a bullish engulfing candle that has completely transformed the Bitcoin charts from somewhat bullish with some bearish possibilities to incredibly bullish. This occurrence was also followed by a noticeable shift in sentiment across social media. So is this the bull run we’ve all been waiting for or is something less exciting responsible for the recent moves?Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Chart. Source: www.btc.comOn Jan. 14 the price of Bitcoin rose from $8,140 to $8,879 which represented a daily increase of around 8.5%. On the same day, the Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by 7.08% and it seems this is a running pattern so far in 2020. On Jan. 1 Bitcoin price was approximately $7,200, and there was an increase in mining difficulty of 6.57%. Whilst there wasn’t an immediate change, 5 days later the Bitcoin price increased by around 7% before stabilizing for 9 days, which is when we saw the 8.5% move on Jan 14. This brings us to Jan. 28 with a modest difficulty increase of 4.67% which saw the price leap from $8,900 to $9,350, which is once again, around the same percentage increase as the mining difficulty.  Currently, there is little over a week until the next 4.46% difficulty increase, so does this mean that Bitcoin will jump another 5% bringing us ever closer to that elusive $10,000 barrier this time next week? If so, could this metric be giving us a taste of what’s to come with the upcoming halving? BTC USD monthly chart. Source: TradingViewThe weekly moving average divergence convergence (MACD) indicator, has always proved an accurate buy/sell indicator for Bitcoin. The last bullish phase started on Feb. 11, 2019, when the price was just $3,695.This lasted 28 weeks and saw Bitcoin rise to a high of $13,800 at the 20-week mark, before crossing bearish again on the 19th of August, at which point the price was still around $11,000.One cannot help but be excited at the prospect of what is ahead of us, as the halving is only 14 weeks away. This is only half of the last bullish phase on the MACD so where could the price realistically go? BTC USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewAt the moment there’s a lot of misinformation being thrown around. Yesterday Cointelegraph reported that some crypto YouTubers are forecasting that Bitcoin price will rise to $100,000 in 2020.As a crypto YouTuber myself, I find this sort of prediction embarrassing and unsubstantiated, as historically the price of Bitcoin doesn’t start to take off until between 6 months to a year after the actual halving date. In November 2012 when the first reward halving happened, Bitcoin was trading at around $10, and the price didn’t start to gain traction until March 2013 when the price climbed to $30.   However, this wasn’t the first time Bitcoin hit $30. Bitcoin had actually between in a 2-year bear market in the run-up and beyond the halving date as the price was $31 in June 2011.  After Bitcoin reached $30 again the price did admittedly go parabolic. In April 2013 Bitcoin price reached a high of $269 before falling back to around the $130 zone until the end of October 2013 and this is the point where the price dramatically took off and reached a price of $1,176 by November 2013. However, this was 12 months after the halving date.  The last halving date was July 2016 and again the numbers aren’t that exciting. At the point of the halving itself, the price was around $650, around 45% lower than the all-time high. The price gained around 10% by December 2016 but didn’t exceed the previous all-time high until March 2017, 10 months after the actual halving date.   So with that in mind, how likely is it that Bitcoin could even reach the previous all-time high of $20,000 in 2020, let alone a figure 5 times that?  As such, it is more reasonable to expect steady growth through 2020, and possibly a parabolic move in 2021 rather. With that being said, traders need to take this market one week at a time. BTC USD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewThere’s some heavy overhead resistance around $9,500 and this figure seems to span back as both key support and resistance over the last 9 months. With the increase in mining difficulty in a week’s time, I expect Bitcoin will break past this pivotal point before encountering its last level of resistance at around $10,000.  Should Bitcoin breakout of this channel, I’d be looking for a meaningful move beyond $10,400 before getting too excited. Everything looks bullish this week so should traders be worried? At the moment, support can be found around $9,150 and $9,000 but it is worth noting that Bitcoin has had a strong bullish run over the last few weeks, therefore a pullback is to be expected at some point. If the price were to break down below $8,600 this would be a worrying development.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

If the price of XRP is stabilizing above the recent resistance, a breakout and continuation are likely to occur.This breakout would lead to a potential retest of the $0.30, the level XRP bounced on throughout 2018. On the other hand, losing the green level at $0.20 would mean continuation to the downside.Total altcoin market capitalization chart.

The market capitalization has been hovering below the $59 billion support for a month, which was flipped into support in the recent week.A similar move was seen in February 2019 with the $49 billion levels. This retest marked the start of an uptrend in the months after. If the total altcoin market capitalization can make a similar move in this period, a push towards $78-80 billion would be expected. At this point, there are two simple scenarios that are likely to happen for the current Bitcoin price action. Let’s start with the bullish one first.BTC USD 1-day chart bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewSupport around the $7,600 area must be maintained for the bullish scenario. If the price of Bitcoin can do that (which it looks like at this point), the price is ready for continuation to the upside.In that regard, a breakout of the downtrend is likely to occur. A breakout would trigger more people to step into the market, causing a strong impulse wave to the upside.If Bitcoin breaks the downtrend, then the $9,500 and $10,000 levels will be the next targets. Another resistance level is found at $8,800, but it’s likely to be broken. The reasoning is simple: a breakout of a 7-months downtrend would give a strong impulse move and strong buying power. Thus, a push to $9,500 is expected to occur.The $9,500 level is crucial as price bounced several times here during the summer of 2019. Therefore, it is likely to be the next resistance.BTC USD 1-day chart bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewThe $7,600 level is also a crucial level for the bearish scenario. If the price of Bitcoin can’t hold the $7,600 level as support, the breakout to the upside can then be classified as a “fake-out,” possibly leading towards the continuation of the downward movements.An example shows the big push towards $10,000 in October. The price of Bitcoin wasn’t able to find support after this push and started to accelerate to the downside, dropping even lower than the recent low.Thus, if the price of Bitcoin can’t hold $7,600, the sentiment will then flip bearish and traders will see where the price of Bitcoin will find new support. In this case, acceleration to the downside would make me believe that $6,400 and even $5,600-5,800 could be tested as the next support levels.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

BTC/USD hit local lows of $3,100 — 84.5% lower — a year later.Now, however, the danger has subsided, Brandt suggested, in comments echoed in the discussion by fellow trader Alessio Rastani.“I think anybody who is interested in what Bitcoin has to offer has to have at least 10-20% of an ownership position relative to the capital that they could commit to Bitcoin in a bigger perspective,” he advised.Bitcoin has sealed monthly gains of around 35%, with 2020 progress alone at 25%. Markets reached local highs of $9,000 on Friday, before encountering resistance, which coincides with the 200-day moving average price, something which has historically stifled bullish progress.The latest statistics meanwhile suggest that interest in Bitcoin extends beyond lay consumers — volume surges on futures markets signal institutional commitment as well, commentators have said.Cointelegraph regularly produces Market Discussions, Interviews and Documentaries.

The move higher meant reclaiming the point of control, which has been acting as an area of support and resistance.Bitcoin price action remains with a diagonal resistance on lower time frames, which has led to the testing of the $6,000s. So far, this area has been one of demand and is showing signs of showing a higher low, which would imply that buyers remain interested in this area for now, although volume continues to subside suggesting that a bigger move is in the works.BTC USD 4-hour chart.

Weekly resistance remains overhead at $7,555 and has not closed above it since the beginning of November.These two levels of resistance are key for the bulls to surpass and it seems likely that a higher low from the upper $6,800 could be a catalyst for an explosive move.Bitcoin’s day candle shows as bearish engulfing with a clear higher low, which is an encouragingly bullish sign. It is worth noting that despite the apparent higher low, Bitcoin has failed to close a higher high at these prices.

Or is there more downside to come before we resume a bull trend?","Daily crypto market performance. Source: Coin360.comBTC USD monthly chart. Source: TradingViewWorking backward through various time frames, a look at the Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) shows it crossed bearishly on Dec. 1 and the first red candle on the histogram was printed.Bitcoin has never seen a single candle before changing the bias on the MACD in its entire history. As it’s one of the most widely used indicators for momentum trading, this indicates that there is bound to be a longer downward period than most traders would like to admit.  However, one positive that is worth taking note of is that the last bullish phase was the shortest the MACD has seen on Bitcoin, just 6 months of green before flipping red. As such, speculating on how much longer we could expect a bear market for is difficult. If these phases are getting smaller and smaller the optimist in me suggests 4 months before we see a true bottom and reversal, which would put the pivot around April 1, 2020.BTC USD BB monthly chart. Source: TradingViewUsing a combination of the Bollinger Bands (BB) indicator and the monthly volume for Bitcoin, it’s impossible to ignore how much volume has dropped off over the last 2 years. This can be interpreted in many ways. Some may view breakouts in these conditions as very short term pumps, as there’s no real interest in the asset, or some may see it as a time to be greedy when others are fearful and start accumulating.  I’m off the view, that there’s no interest in Bitcoin, therefore the price movements we’re witnessing are short term pumps as whales continue to offload their bags as they wait for the bottom.  The moving average (MA) of the BB shows $7,100 as critical support for Bitcoin. Should the price fall below $7,100 and this price level flips to resistance, we can then expect the price of Bitcoin to slowly make its way towards the support of the BB which is currently $2,500-$3,200 depending on your BB settings.  I see the bottom BB support at $3,200. However, I don’t believe we will get this low. The support on the BB is gradually getting higher by the month. If it continues at this trajectory, the support could be as high as $3,800 by April 1, 2020.    This to me is a plausible target date for the bottom since the upcoming halving is expected in May, and I’m not the only person that shares this view. Twitter user @22loops called the 2019 bottom with astonishing accuracy last year, and he’s at again with his new year's tweet that puts Bitcoin price at around $3,797.BTCUSD weekly chart. Source: TradingViewMoving over to the weekly BB, we can see where Bitcoin faltered last week. It was rejected precisely at the MA of $8,462 leaving the digital asset in the lower part of the Bollinger Bands. Therefore, until Bitcoin flips the MA to support, there’s no real reason to be bullish just yet.The support here shows $6,330 as the last stronghold for Bitcoin before beginning to accept the likelihood of a sub-$4,000 Bitcoin price. However, should Bitcoin find itself on another run, breaking past the $10,000 barrier doesn’t seem to be where the issue is, but slightly higher around $10,500 seems to be where we’d expect to see BTC struggle. Currently, both of these scenarios are too early to call, but with that being said, the weekly MACD is definitely giving a reason for the bulls to be excited.BTCUSD weekly RSI chart. Source: TradingViewWhilst I’m a big fan of following the weekly MACD as a very reliable indicator for Bitcoin, there is one element that I can’t overlook in its current setup. If the Bitcoin price continues to stay in its current range for another 2-3 weeks, the MACD line is set to cross bullish.  However, the positioning around the zero line doesn’t look too hot. If we take a look at the last 2 bullish crosses, they occurred at - 472 and -899 with the latter being the cross that had more momentum.  The cross at -472 resulted in some bullish momentum, but shortly after, the Bitcoin price fell again, and it crossed into a bear trend. What is concerning here, is that should Bitcoin cross bullish on the weekly MACD, it’s likely to occur somewhere around -200 below the zero line. But what does that mean for the next bullish move? History tells us, that perhaps it’s too early to be screaming “Bitcoin bull run” from the rooftops just yet, and this is further echoed by the rather weak Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, which is currently only showing a reading of 46.53 on the weekly timeframe.The daily charts, however, are starting to tell a story of what to expect when you combine all 4 indicators mentioned in this analysis.  BTCUSD daily chart. Source: TradingViewAbove is what I see as a short setup. The Bitcoin price is at the top of the BB. The RSI is overbought, and the volume is declining, however, volume is typically thinner at the weekends. The last thing I’d look at is for the MACD to cross down. At present, the MACD is still strong and is yet to show signs of crossing down.  If there’s a decline in the price, the MACD will start to cross down, and from here I’d be looking at the BB MA as my target price which is $7,400; and this target I feel is realistic due to the gap left on the CME chart. BTCUSD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe CME is showing a gap at $7,685. Whilst this is a very tight gap that some may argue nearly closed last week, the fact remains it is there on the charts for all to see.   Closing this gap would most certainly force the daily MACD to cross bearish, and potentially end the bullish momentum for the price of Bitcoin.If the CME gap fills, and Bitcoin continues to fall from $7,865, then the levels of support to watch would be $7,400. If this level fails to hold, the monthly MA on the Bollinger Bands shows that $7,100 is the price to defend. If both these levels hold, the last chance saloon for Bitcoin is $6,800 before the hodler doomsday scenarios start playing out, and from here I’d be looking for another MACD bear to bull cycle before being bullish again. Not much has changed since last week. The daily and weekly MACD are both bullish and should Bitcoin continue on this path the key resistance that must be broken remains at $8,500. Breaking this level would change the path of Bitcoin massively, opening up much larger leaps in price towards $10,500-$11,000 levels. That being said, 2-3 weeks of flat price action is equally bullish for Bitcoin in the medium term.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of @officiallykeith and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Four years later, the supply halved to the current rate of 12.5 BTC per block, and the price was $652.With Bitcoin gaining over 30% in January alone to hit $9,450, expectations are now higher than ever that the May 2020 halving will produce serious price action a lot closer to $12,000 than $12.“So, does the Bitcoin halving help drive prices higher? Absolutely,” Weiss summarized. “The only question now is how high will #BTC go this time around?”Bitcoin block reward halvings and price floors. Source: Weiss Ratings/ TwitterThe impact of the 2016 halving was somewhat delayed. In the event, Bitcoin only shot to all-time highs of $20,000 in a bull run which began a year later. Similarly, some analysts expect a latency period to accompany the May block reward halving to 6.25 BTC.As Cointelegraph reported, however, other statistics make 2020 an even more conspicuous year for Bitcoin. In terms of inflation, for example, the halving will reduce Bitcoin’s rate to less than that of both gold and the Federal Reserve’s target for the United States economy.In 2021, according to one historically accurate price model which demonstrates the knock-on effect of Bitcoin supply reductions, BTC/USD should hit a new all-time high of $100,000."

Noting that he’s “neither here nor there on Bitcoin,” Musk focused on its use for illegal transactions.","The billionaire has recently been in the spotlight for several short and cryptic tweets related to cryptocurrency. On Jan. 10 he published a tweet saying “Bitcoin is *not* my safe word.”This follows an equally cryptic tweet from April 2019, saying “Cryptocurrency is my safe word.” But while they were generally considered to be jokes, especially in light of previous tweets where he pledged to take “Tesla private at $420,” Musk’s early history is deeply tied to the financial technology industry.In 1999, Elon Musk founded X.com, an online bank that through later mergers became PayPal. He mentioned the company in the podcast, noting:“If PayPal had executed the plan that I wanted to execute on, I think it would probably be the most valuable company in the world.”The interviewers then asked what Musk thought about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, given their spiritual similarity to X.com. Musk replied that he’s “neither here nor there on Bitcoin.”While referring to Satoshi’s white paper as “pretty clever,” he prefaced by saying that his stance on cryptocurrencies “gets the crypto people angry.” He continued:“There are transactions that are not within the bounds of the law — there are obviously many laws in different countries — and normally cash is used for these transactions. But in order for illegal transactions to occur, the cash must also be used for legal transactions. You need an illegal-to-legal bridge. That's where crypto comes in.”Musk noted that cash is increasingly harder to use, but any alternative would have to be usable for both legal and illegal purposes, as “it doesn’t count otherwise.”Even though he may not be entirely sold on cryptocurrencies, Musk sees a clear purpose for them: “You must have a legal to illegal bridge. So where I see crypto is effectively as a replacement for cash. I do not see crypto being the primary database [for transactions].”Despite the negative connotation from being used for illegal purposes, he emphasized that he’s not being “judgmental about crypto.” In Musk’s view, the governments overreach in certain aspects:“I think there's a lot of things that are illegal that shouldn't be illegal. I think that sometimes governments just have too many laws about the missions that they should have, and shouldn't have so many things that are illegal.”While not a full endorsement, Musk is not exactly opposite to cryptocurrencies. In an earlier part of the interview, he said that “banks are in trouble” — though he primarily referred to competitors such as Stripe."

Although BTC rallied to $8,400 a few days ago — which is the next resistance zone, according to analysts — prices have since retreated back to the low $8,000s. It follows speculation that geopolitical instability, fuelled by the increasing tensions between the United States and Iran, may have sparked the surge. Data from Google Trends showed that the search term “Bitcoin Iran” surged 4,450% in the seven days leading up to Jan. 8. Also this week, Fundstrat Global Advisors suggested that BTC has the potential to deliver 100% returns to investors in 2020 — and prices may rise significantly in the five months before the halving in May.ECB president pushes for a central bank digital currencyThe president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has said she supports the institution’s efforts to develop a central bank digital currency that would facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments. She revealed that the ECB is continuing to “assess the costs and benefits” of such an asset, as it would enable the public to continue using central bank money even when old-fashioned coins and banknotes decline. Adding a note of caution, an ECB spokesperson told Cointelegraph that “it will take a while” before its in-depth analysis on a CBDC is complete. Nations around the world are racing to launch their own digital currencies — and this week, the People’s Bank of China said work on its digital yuan is “progressing smoothly.”Court denies SEC request to make Telegram reveal ICO bank recordsA request by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for Telegram to reveal its bank records has been rejected by a judge in New York. Telegram’s lawyers will undoubtedly be breathing a sigh of relief that the application has been thrown out. The SEC has been trying to find out how Telegram spent the $1.7 billion raised during its initial coin offering in 2018, but the company said the regulator’s request amounted to an “unfounded fishing expedition.” It isn’t all smooth sailing for Telegram, however, as it will still have to prove that its bank records comply with foreign data privacy laws. The messaging platform said that this review will take up to seven weeks to prepare.Former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles seeks to put long-standing lawsuit to restThe former CEO of the defunct BTC exchange Mt. Gox has kickstarted efforts to put an end to litigation that was filed by a former user of the exchange back in 2014. Mark Karpeles argues that he is entitled to summary judgment because Gregory Greene, the main plaintiff, has admitted that his initial claims were either untrue or unsupported. The defendant’s lawyers wrote: “The time has come to end this litigation in its entirety.” Greene’s lawsuit accuses Karpeles of criminal conversion and fraud, and alleges that Mt. Gox’s bank continued to accept deposits even while customers were having difficulty withdrawing their funds. Mt. Gox famously collapsed in 2014 when around 800,000 BTC — at least 700,000 of which belonged to customers — was stolen.Binance charity launches relief effort for Australian bushfiresThe Binance Charity Foundation is donating $1 million worth of BNB tokens to the Australia Bushfire Donations project. The pledge from the philanthropic arm of the major cryptocurrency exchange comes as the country struggles to cope with devastating fires that have killed dozens of people, destroyed thousands of homes and scorched large swathes of land.

He told Bloomberg that the reasons for the rise will only become clear once a bullish surge kicks in. Singh pointed to how BTC enjoyed gains when Greece was grappling with its sovereign debt crisis in 2015, and the boost for crypto awareness that came when Facebook announced plans for its Libra stablecoin last year. His prediction is one of the more optimistic out there. While Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz believes $12,000 will be achievable in 2020, veteran trader Peter Brandt thinks BTC could tumble to $5,500 in the summer.Related: Experts Share: What Will Bitcoin’s Price Look Like in 2020?Bitcoin scam ads featuring Martin Lewis now spotted on InstagramA British financial expert has warned the public to be aware of BTC scam adverts featuring his face on Instagram. In the ad, Martin Lewis appears to be endorsing a “revolutionary Bitcoin home-based opportunity” — and it links to a rip-off version of a major news website. This comes months after Lewis successfully settled a defamation lawsuit against Facebook, the owner of Instagram, for showing similar ads. Although Facebook and Instagram had banned crypto ads at the start of 2018, it eased this policy in May 2019 — prompting dozens of fake Libra pages to flood both sites.CFTC cannot locate man responsible for $140 million crypto Ponzi schemeRed-faced officials at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have said they cannot locate a man who is allegedly responsible for a crypto Ponzi scheme worth more than $140 million. Benjamin Reynolds is accused of defrauding over 1,000 investors to the tune of 22,858 BTC. The CFTC tried to serve Reynolds at the “service address” of the company that managed the scheme, but it emerged that the address didn’t actually exist. Attempts to contact him over email have also been unsuccessful.Directors of alleged crypto pyramid scheme Dunamiscoins to stand trialTwo directors of an alleged crypto pyramid scheme in Uganda have appeared in court to face 65 counts tied to obtaining money by false promise. Prosecutors have logged more than 4,000 complaints against Dunamiscoins, a suspected fraud that collapsed in December 2019 after almost two years in operation. It is believed that dozens of victims lost up to $38,000 investing in the scheme, which promised to deliver extraordinary returns.

Bitcoin has reached five figures for the first time since last October. According to Coin360, BTC is up by more than 40% year to date — 8.3% over the past week. Champagne corks will also be flying in the Ether community, as the coin is up 21% to near $230 — a new 2020 high. But as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency returns to five figures, some believe there’s increasing potential for Bitcoin to lose value in the short term. Alameda Research co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried believes BTC may only continue appreciating if the coronavirus crisis worsens — and predicts it will slip back to $6,800 without “continued unrest.” Have global events been responsible for Bitcoin’s remarkable start to 2020?A member of the United States Federal Reserve’s board of governors has hinted that the institution is warming to the idea of central bank digital currencies. Lael Brainard, who chairs, said the Fed is “conducting research and experimentation” into CBDCs — and wants to be at the forefront of the debate given the dollar’s important role in global markets. This is a marked departure from less than 18 months ago when she said: “There is no compelling demonstrated need for a Fed-issued digital currency.” Of course, a lot has happened since then — including Facebook’s plans to launch Libra. In other news, it’s emerged that six major central banks are going to meet in April to discuss the development of CBDCs. Even though these talks will take place in Washington, D.C., the U.S. will not be attending — only representatives from the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland will be around the table.When Facebook unveiled plans to launch a stablecoin, one of the most exciting elements was how major financial institutions such as Mastercard, Visa and PayPal were founding members of the Libra Association. Alas, all three quit a few months later with no proper explanation. Now, we’re starting to get answers. Mastercard’s CEO Ajay Banga, speaking to the Financial Times, attacked Libra for its lack of transparency. He said he also had concerns surrounding the stablecoin’s business model because the association hasn’t made clear how it will make money — and that the Calibra wallet didn’t seem to tally with Libra’s vision of serving as a financial inclusion tool. Nonetheless, Banga said he liked the idea of a global currency, describing siloed systems in a world where citizens travel globally as “really stupid.”Now, here’s a mysterious tale. Some users of Coinbase are apparently not allowed to withdraw more than $10 a day. One Redditor said he had been subject to the limit, and that the company had denied his request to have it raised. Some of those who replied to the thread predicted that further restrictions could follow if crypto prices reach an all-time high. Cointelegraph asked Coinbase for an official statement on the matter, but, at the time of writing, no response has been forthcoming.And a happy story to end our news round-up. Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun has finally had his charity lunch with billionaire Warren Buffett. Back in June, Sun had won an auction for the honor on eBay with a bid of $4.5 million — a record. However, the buffet with Buffett was pushed back by Sun due to medical reasons. After the pair broke bread in Nebraska, Sun said he was grateful for Buffett’s “wisdom and vision.” He added: “I'll always remember his kindness and support and will take Mr. Buffett’s advice and guidance to make Tron a better ecosystem, business with all the partners in the blockchain space and beyond.”At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $10,089.42, Ether at $227.87 and XRP at $0.28.

He told Yahoo Finance that he is “really optimistic” about the cryptocurrency’s short-term potential — primarily because it has gone back above its 200-day moving average. Lee claimed that this usually signals the return of a bull market, adding: “Whenever Bitcoin breaks back into its 200-day, its average six-month gain is 197%.” The investor firmly believes that May’s block reward halving will serve as a catalyst for further gains — and has previously said this event has not been “priced in.” Only time will tell whether he’s right.Two men have been charged over an alleged crypto Ponzi scheme that duped an unknown number of investors — including professional basketball players. John Michael Caruso and Zachary Salter are accused of wooing their victims by posting about their supposed luxurious lifestyles on social media. It’s claimed that more than 90 people have been swindled out of at least $7.5 million since June 2018. Forensic accountants believe none of the money taken from investors was actually invested in cryptocurrency. Instead, $350,000 was spent on luxury car rentals, and the pair are said to have lost $830,000 during a 134-hour gambling spree at casinos in Las Vegas.North Korea’s Lazarus Group managed to steal from the DragonEx crypto exchange by creating a fake but realistic trading bot, according to Chainalysis. The sophisticated attack saw the cybercriminals create a compelling website and social media presence for a non-existent company called WFC Proof. The supposed firm offered software to employees of the Singapore-based exchange that was eventually installed on a machine that contained the private keys to DragonEx’s hot wallet. An estimated $7 million in various cryptocurrencies was subsequently taken. In a rather ironic twist, the WFC Proof website had warned visitors not to let anyone access personal private keys.The counsel for the estate of Dave Kleiman has accused self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright of abusing attorney-client privilege to withhold documents and confuse trial proceedings.

These, he noted, represented a gap in CME Bitcoin futures prices — around $7,680 — something Bitcoin has historically sought to “fill” on multiple occasions. “This flip would be the best + closing the CME gap,” he summarized in his latest Twitter post on Thursday.Continuing, Van de Poppe suggested that potential bounce could send BTC/USD much higher than Wednesday’s peak: “Breakout upwards and I'd be aiming for $9,500 (or $11,000 as $9,500 is the same as $6,000 -> everybody wants to short there -> extra fuel).”Nonetheless, the potential for downside remained, with a return to recent lows of $6,400 also possible, he added.In the long term, the mood is meanwhile turning steadily bullish.

In 2015, the Greek sovereign debt crisis sparked gains for Bitcoin, while last year saw the sudden announcement of Facebook’s Libra digital currency and a worldwide reaction from lawmakers and the wider community.More recently, rising tensions between the United States and Iran were attributed by some commentators and news media to BTC price rising around 20% over the past week. One publication noted that this may be due to Bitcoin being “free from state interference or geopolitical risk.”The net result of all such events, he explained, was a small number of new buyers entering the Bitcoin space:“I don’t think people actually went and sold their GD stock and all that and bought Bitcoin, but I see what happens is just a little bit of people start buying Bitcoin and that, with technical trading, really bumps it up and makes it go a lot higher a lot faster.”Singh almost successfully called Bitcoin’s 2019 high of $13,800. At the height of the 2018 bear market, when the cryptocurrency traded at just $3,100, he went on record to forecast a $15,000-$20,000 price tag at some point in the coming twelve months.$20,000 nonetheless remains on the more optimistic end of the spate of recent price predictions from cryptocurrency figures.As Cointelegraph reported, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz said he expects $12,000 this year, while veteran trader Peter Brandt considers a bearish $5,500 likely in July.By contrast, entrepreneur John McAfee recently reneged on a potentially compromising wager with himself which calls for Bitcoin to trade at $1 million by 2021."

Since July 16, 2019, this level functioned as strong support so if bulls are able to flip this resistance to support it would solidify Bitcoin’s trend reversal and significantly reduce the likelihood that the price will drop below $8,000 in the near future. $9,119 is also close to the 36.2% Fibonacci retracement level from Bitcon’s June 26 drop from $13,800. Some traders view this Fib level as being nearly as significant as the 61.8% level and the daily chart shows this Bitocin frequently bounced off this level as support for 6 months before dropping below it in September 2019 thus flipping it to resistance. Over the coming days bulls will fantasize about Bitcoin sustaining above $9,119.85, then pushing its way through the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $9,250 as this would set the digital asset up for a well-measured shot at $10,000.  Bitcoin daily price chart.

Bitcoin price, but the market itself may not have the right ...","Jan 8, 2020","Bitcoin (BTC) returning to a bull market depends on whether “cryptocultists” have already exited the market, veteran trader Peter Brandt has warned.","In a tweet on Jan. 8, Brandt, who has become a regular Bitcoin pundit in recent years, confirmed he was eyeing current price activity to determine the likely next move.BTC/USD gained 5.5% in the 24 hours to press time, retaking $8,000 in a move many previously considered highly unlikely. Whether momentum continues, Brandt says, is nonetheless down to the composition of the market, as well as technical indicators.On the topic of whether a bull market began this week, he summarized:“If enough cryptocultists have been shaken out since Dec '17, then ‘yes.’ If not, then ‘no.’”Uploading supporting charts, Brandt highlighted three characteristics that hinted at a bullish upturn for Bitcoin. These included BTC/USD remaining within a multiyear channel and not falling through the bottom of it, as well as preparing to break the ceiling of a different, six-month channel.Asked whether he thought it was “too early” for a fresh bull run due to investors anticipating lower prices first, meanwhile, Brandt responded:“I think exactly the opposite. If there are many waiting, then they may wait forever.”The sober approach to possible further gains echoes Brandt’s more bearish stance from earlier. In December, he forecast BTC/USD dropping to $5,500 by July 2020, two months after Bitcoin’s block reward halving. Other grave warnings included a Bitcoin price of just $2,760, an 80% retraction against 2019’s highs near $14,000.His predictions have often been accurate — in 2017, he successfully called the Bitcoin market top at around $20,000 before the 2018 bear market kicked in. There was no word on altcoins, investors in which Brandt similarly called “cryptomaniacs” in July. At the time, he claimed any major appreciation in Bitcoin would be unlikely to spill over into altcoin markets. Bitcoin’s market share subsequently increased by around 4%."

its essential features and characteristics are what make it the number ...","Jan 23, 2020","Over the last 10 years, the Bitcoin ecosystem has attracted developers to dedicate thousands of hours to improve and revamp most of its underlying codebase. Yet, Bitcoin (BTC) is largely the same. The reason for this is that its core set of consensus rules that define its monetary properties, such as its algorithmic inflation and hard-coded supply, remain unchanged.","Time and time again, factions have attempted to change these core properties, but all hostile takeovers thus far have failed. It’s often a painful process but one that highlights and solidifies two of Bitcoin’s biggest virtues: No single party can dictate how Bitcoin evolves; and the absence of centralized control protects Bitcoin’s monetary properties.The values that make Bitcoin a popular phenomenon are also those that make developing software atop Bitcoin more challenging than any other digital asset. Developers are limited to what they’re able to transform in order to not undermine its apparatus as a store of value.Nonetheless, as we’ll see from the examples below, innovation in Bitcoin is possible. It requires creativity and patience.Since changing Bitcoin’s core layer requires a quasi-political process that may infringe upon its monetary properties, innovation is often implemented as modules. This development is similar to that of the internet's protocol suite, where layers of different protocols specialize in specific functions. Emails were handled by SMTP, files by FTP, web pages by HTTP, user addressing by IP and packet routing by TCP. Each of these protocols has evolved over time to create the experience we have today.Spencer Bogart of Blockchain Capital has captured this development succinctly: We are now witnessing the beginning of Bitcoin’s own protocol suite. The inflexibility of Bitcoin’s core layer has birthed several additional protocols that specialize in various applications, like Lightning’s BOLT standard for payment channels. Innovation is both vibrant and relatively safe, as this layered approach minimizes potential risks.The diagram below is an attempt to map all relatively new initiatives and showcases a more complete representation of Bitcoin’s technology stack. It is not exhaustive and does not signal any endorsement for specific initiatives. It is, nevertheless, impressive to see that innovation being pushed on all fronts — from Layer 2 technologies to emerging smart contract solutions.There has been a lot of talk lately about the rate of adoption of the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s most prominent Layer 2 technology. Critics often point to an apparent decline in the number of channels and total BTC locked when evaluating Lightning’s user adoption. Yet, these metrics aren’t the most definitive measurement of adoption.Related: What Is Lightning Network And How It WorksOne of the most underrated virtues of the Lightning Network is its straightforward privacy properties. Since Lightning does not rely on global state reconciliation — i.e., its own blockchain — users can transact privately over using additional techniques and network overlays, like Tor. Activity happening within private channels is not captured by popular Lightning explorers. As such, an increase in private usage of Lightning has resulted in a decrease in what can be publicly measured, leading observers to erroneously conclude that adoption is down. While it is true that Lightning must overcome substantial usability barriers before it can enjoy wide adoption, using misleading metrics to make assertions about the current state of the network serves few.Another recent development in the field of Layer 2 privacy was the creation of WhatSat, a private messaging system atop Lightning. This project is a modification of the Lightning Network Daemon (LND) that allows the relayers of private messages, who connect the entities communicating, to be compensated for their services via micropayments. This decentralized, censorship-and-spam-resistant chat was enabled by innovations in the LND itself, such as recent improvements in the lightning-onion, Lightning’s own onion routing protocol.There are several other projects leveraging Lightning’s private micropayment capabilities for numerous applications from a Lightning-powered cloud computing VPS to an image hosting service that shares ad revenue via microtransactions. More generally, we define Layer 2 as a suite of applications that can use Bitcoin’s base layer as a court where exogenous events are reconciled and disputes are settled. As such, the theme of data anchoring on Bitcoin’s blockchain goes beyond Lightning, with companies like Microsoft pioneering a decentralized ID system atop Bitcoin.There are projects attempting to bring back expressive smart contract functionality to Bitcoin in a safe and responsible way. This is a significant development because, starting in 2010, several of the original Bitcoin opcodes — the operations that determine what Bitcoin is able to compute — were removed from the protocol. This came after a series of bugs were revealed, which led Satoshi to disable some of the functionality of Script, Bitcoin’s programming language.Over the years, it became clear that there are non-trivial security risks that accompany highly-expressive smart contracts. The common rule of thumb is that the more functionality is introduced to a virtual machine — the collective verification mechanism that processes opcodes — the more unpredictable its programs will be. More recently, however, we have seen new approaches to smart contract architecture that can minimize unpredictability and also provide vast functionality.The devise of a new approach to Bitcoin smart contracts called Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) has since triggered a new wave of supporting technologies for Bitcoin smart contracts. Taproot is one of the most prominent implementations of the MAST structure that enables an entire application to be expressed as a Merkle Tree, whereby each branch of the tree represents a different execution outcome.Another interesting innovation that has recently resurfaced is a new architecture for the implementation of covenants, or spend conditions, on Bitcoin transactions. Originally proposed as a thought experiment by Greg Maxwell back in 2013, covenants are an approach to limit the way balances can be spent, even as their custody changes. Although the idea has existed for nearly six years, covenants were impractical to be implemented before the advent of Taproot. Currently, a new opcode called OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY — formerly known as OP_SECURETHEBAG — is leveraging this new technology to potentially enable covenants to be safely implemented in Bitcoin.At first glance, covenants are incredibly useful in the context of lending — and perhaps Bitcoin-based derivatives — as they enable the creation of policies, like clawbacks, to be implemented on specific BTC balances. But their potential impact on the usability of Bitcoin goes vastly beyond lending. Covenants can allow for the implementation of things like Bitcoin Vaults, which, in the context of custody, provide the equivalent of a second private key that allows someone that has been hacked to “freeze” stolen funds.In essence, Schnorr signatures are the technological primitive that make all of these new approaches to smart contracts possible. And there are even edgier techniques being currently theorized, such as Scriptless Scripts, which could enable fully private and scalable Bitcoin smart contracts to be represented as digital signatures as opposed to opcodes. These new approaches may enable novel smart contract applications to be built atop Bitcoin.There have also been some interesting developments in mining protocols, especially those used by mining pool constituents. Even though the issue of centralization in Bitcoin mining is often wildly exaggerated, it is true that there are power structures retained by mining pool operators that can be further decentralized. Namely, pool operators can decide what transactions will be mined by all pool constituents, which grants them considerable power. Over time, some operators have abused this power by censoring transactions, mining empty blocks and reallocating hashing without the authorization of constituents.Changes to mining protocols have aimed to subvert the control that mining pool operators can have on deciding what transactions are mined. One of the most substantial changes coming to Bitcoin mining is the second version of Stratum, the most popular protocol used in mining pools. Stratum V2 is a complete overhaul that implements BetterHash, a secondary protocol that enables mining pool constituents to decide the composition of the block they will mine — not the other way around.Another development that should contribute to more stability is reignited interest in hash rates and difficulty derivatives. These can be particularly useful for mining operations that wish to hedge against hash rate fluctuations and difficulty readjustments.Contrary to some arguments out there, there are a host of emerging protocols that can bring optional privacy into Bitcoin. That being said, it is likely that privacy in Bitcoin will continue to be more of an art than a science for years to come.More generally, the biggest impediment to private transactions across digital assets is that most solutions are half-baked. Privacy assets that focus on transaction-graph privacy often neglect network-level privacy, and vice versa. Both vectors suffer from a lack of maturity and usage, which makes transactions easier to de-shield via statistical traceability analysis at either the peer-to-peer (P2P) network layer or the blockchain layer.Thankfully, there are several projects that are pushing boundaries on both fronts.When it comes to transaction-graph privacy, solutions like P2EP and CheckTemplateVerify are interesting because privacy becomes a by-product of efficiency. As these are novel additions to CoinJoin, such solutions can increase the adoption of private transactions by users who are solely motivated by lower transaction fees. Under CoinJoin, their privacy guarantees are still suboptimal, but unshielded sent amounts can be beneficial, as they preserve the auditability of Bitcoin’s supply.If lower transaction fees become a motivator and lead to an increase in Bitcoin’s anonymity set — the percentage of UTXOs that are CoinJoin outputs — de-anonymization via statistical analysis will be even more subjective than it already is.There has also been considerable progress in the privacy of P2P communications, with protocols like Dandelion being tested across crypto networks. Another notable development is Erlay, an alternative transaction relay protocol that increases the efficiency of private communications and reduces the overhead of running a node. Erlay is an important improvement since its efficiency gains enable more users to more easily complete IBD and continuously validate the chain, especially in countries where ISPs impose caps on bandwidth.These examples are only a handful of initiatives in play to transform the Bitcoin framework. Bitcoin, in its totality, is a constantly evolving suite of protocols.While evolution within a relatively strict set of rules and values can be challenging for developers, the layered approach that we’ve seen unfold is what makes gradual, effective change possible. Minimizing politicism within Bitcoin and protecting its fundamental monetary properties are necessary parts of the process. Developers are learning how to work within these bounds in a meaningful fashion.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Lucas Nuzzi, director of technology of Digital Asset Research.

asymmetric assets he has ever seen in his career as a fund ...","Jan 31, 2020","Bitcoin (BTC) represents an investment in technology and innovation, making it a must-have in any portfolio, suggested the CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, in an interview with Max Keiser on the Keiser Report, published on Jan. 30.  ","Keiser began by noting that portfolios with even 1% exposure to Bitcoin have more alpha or, in other words, have outperformed just about everything over the past five years. By definition, alpha represents the performance of a portfolio relative to a benchmark. Portfolio managers seek to generate alpha by diversifying portfolios to remove unsystematic risk.“It’s incredible,” said Yusko. “If you took 1% of all the endowments and foundations five years ago, that would have been $6.7 billion out of $670 billion. You took that one percent — half percent from stocks, half from bonds — instead of making 7.2%, which is what they made, they would have made 9.2% or 200 basis points better. Two on 7.2% is a lot of alpha.”But while conceding that Bitcoin had a non-zero probability of price going to zero, he also pointed out that it offers ten-to-one downside capture. This, according to Yusko, makes Bitcoin one of the most asymmetric assets he has ever seen in his career. He also suggests that it will become increasingly normal for traditional funds to seek exposure, continuing: “So the idea that ten years from now we won’t look back and say that as a fiduciary of a pension fund, sovereign wealth, family office, etc. you had to have exposure to this asset, is crazy.”Evidence is indeed mounting that Bitcoin becoming increasingly accepted among investors, particularly as the price of BTC is currently climbing back toward the $10,00 mark.  Cryptocurrency market monthly performance. Source: Coin360With Bitcoin’s rising volumes and open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, new institutional investment products, not to mention outperforming everything including Amazon stock and gold in recent years, BTC is looking increasingly attractive to investors. Admittedly, many fund managers still view Bitcoin as some scam or scheme, notes Yusko, as opposed to what he says is truly an evolution of technology, in which Bitcoin will play a fundamental role as a base layer protocol.But while both Keiser and Yusko agreed that most cryptocurrencies will fail, Bitcoin and perhaps a handful of other cryptocurrencies may provide an opportunity that’s quite different from dot-com era tech stocks. “The protocol is the application,” said Keiser, equating it to an opportunity of buying shares in the concept of email in the 1990s. He continued: “With Bitcoin, you have that opportunity. You’re owning a piece of the protocol that’s dominating.” As Cointelegraph reported last month, Bitcoin has dwarfed all other assets in returns over the past decade at nearly 9,000,000 percent. So far this year, however, BTC isn’t even the best performing asset. Tesla stock, or TSLA, is up 38% year to date compared to Bitcoin’s 30%.In October, Cointelegraph reported on investment management firm VanEck explaining why Bitcoin improves investor portfolio performance, with BTC’s low correlation to traditional assets cited as one of the main reasons."

computing: It's not as distant a future as it might seem. 21153 Total views.","Jan 9, 2020","The topic of quantum computing has been steadily gaining interest within the cryptosphere, particularly so over the past 12 months. Given the heightened curiosity and concern, it is worth resolving some open questions around quantum supremacy for the crypto community, as there is a tremendous amount of misinformation circulating online.","Many people harbor the fear that Sycamore, Google’s 54-qubit quantum processor, could outsmart the system and steal everyone’s Bitcoin. If there were to be no changes to the current implementation of the Bitcoin network, this would most likely become a reality within five to 10 years. So, while there is currently no need for users to worry, developers are well advised to commence preparations. What’s truly alarming is that “quantum deniers” refute the reality of the problem and insist that concern should be curbed. Sadly, the exact opposite is true. We must place a collective focus on solving the issue, as complex distributed systems (does blockchain ring a bell?) are anything but easy to upgrade to a whole new crypto stack. Having spent a decade or two maturing, the ecosystem could be massively undermined if quantum computing advances to the expected degree.Related: Quantum Computing Vs. Blockchain: Impact on CryptographyCertainty about this stems from the fact that current encryption schemes (including those used by Bitcoin and Ethereum) have already proven vulnerable to signature forgery executable by quantum computers. Asymmetric cryptography relies on keypairs (namely a private and public key), where the public could be calculated from its private counterpart but not the other way around. This is due to the impossibility of certain mathematical problems like factoring a number that’s a product of large primes or calculating the multiplicand of the generator that resulted in a public key, which most blockchains and cryptographic systems use.If the calculation could be done the other way around (i.e., calculating a private key from a public key), the whole scheme breaks. All we need is more qubits and stability in these systems for such attacks to become executable.This is another often-asked question but in reality, quantum computers are far less efficient at symmetric crypto-related computations than asymmetric crypto-related ones. As for the numbers, it takes 2^128 operations on a mainstream computer to locate a BTC private key of a given BTC public key, whereas it only takes 128^3 operations on a quantum computer to achieve the same feat. For hashing, the difference — while still enormous — is a lot less. In essence, we need to worry more about people with quantum computers spending/stealing our money rather than fretting about Google mining the remaining Bitcoin. Even if that were the case, after successfully mining 2016 blocks, it would set the difficulty to “quantum level” — meaning that Bitcoin would only be mineable by quantum computers.Related: Is Crypto Ready for the New Space Age?The tricky question here is that the difficulty is hitting such levels already that miners need to wait to be able to readjust the timestamp field of given blocks because they already ran through all possible nonces for a given block without finding a result below the difficulty target. In light of this, I would venture to say that this mining-related problem is more theoretical than practical. We have already noted that time can be the limiting factor in finding a correct solution for a block, not performance, even without quantum computing-based mining.Should Bitcoin holders be concerned about the quantum problem in 2020? No, but there is a caveat: Cryptocurrencies (meaning their developer communities) and enterprises should focus on the issue. What if there are quantum computers already built that are much more capable than Google’s Sycamore and we are just not allowed to know about them? We should seek and upgrade to a quantum-resistant crypto stack in blockchain implementations and all other systems that depend on asymmetric crypto (e.g., banks, governments, etc.) as soon as possible. Quantum supremacy is inevitable — it’s just a case of when.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Johann Polecsak is the co-founder and chief technology officer at Centrum Circle and the CTO at QANplatform.

Burton continued:“And then there’ll be a fast move that’ll come, and a lot of people will say, ‘Oh my God, why was I not on that move?’”BTC/USD was trading at around $8,600 on Monday, having gained almost 4% over the weekend. As Cointelegraph reported, a number of price indicators are flipping bullish for Bitcoin under current conditions, providing strong suggestions of bullish momentum on both a short and long-term basis.“I think the market has done a good job of shaking out a load of people into 2018 and 2019, but I think it’s probably a different type of shakeout now,” Burton continued.The comments broadly echoed previous market discussion guest, Peter Brandt, who also argued that buyers planning to enter at $6,000 had “already missed” their opportunity. “The weak hands are out — the strong hands own it,” he famously summarized last weekend. Fellow guest YouTuber and Twitch regular Eric Krown appeared to agree. Based on technical analysis, he suggested that it would be “poetic” if Bitcoin denied the lower levels demanded by some traders.Cointelegraph regularly produces Market Discussions, Interviews and Documentaries.

David Kleiman, and they mined a lot of Bitcoin together back ...","Jan 15, 2020",UPDATE 1/15/19 1730 UTC: This article has been modified to reflect the fact that the recent filing refers to Wright having provided a list of wallet addresses rather than the private keys that would give him access to their contents.,"Craig Wright, the polarizing figure who may or may not be Satoshi Nakamoto, is today telling the court that he has received the public keys associated an $8.9 billion crypto fortune called the Tulip Trust.Some background on what that means: Wright was a business partner to one David Kleiman, and they mined a lot of Bitcoin together back when that was an easier thing to do. The pair ended up with 1.1 million Bitcoin in their custody, and that stash is known as the “Tulip Trust” in reference to the tulip bubble that took the Netherlands by storm in the 17th century.Kleiman passed away in 2013, and the law is clear that half of the business’ assets should go to Kleiman’s estate. But this never happened, so Kleiman’s surviving brother is suing Wright for the estate’s share.A 2015 investigation pointed to Wright and Kleiman as the possible inventors of Bitcoin, and reporters surfaced a draft of a contract that described the existence of the trust and effectively grants all of it to Wright. This moved David Kleiman’s brother Ira to launch the suit in February 2018.It was a long and drawn out process for the legal system to identify where Wright was storing his crypto assets, and Wright was ultimately found in contempt of court last year for failing to supply a list of any BTC holdings he acquired before December 31, 2013. Wright then received a court order on January 10, 2020 calling for him to effectively open the kimono on the Tulip Trust.He was granted until February 3, 2020 to provide the keys to the Tulip Trust on the rationale that the public keys needed to be delivered by a bonded courier sometime in January.Wright has now filed paperwork demonstrating his compliance with the court order:Dr. Wright notifies the Court that a third party has provided the necessary information and key slice to unlock the encrypted file, and Dr. Wright has produced a list of his bitcoin holdings, as ordered by the Magistrate Judge, to plaintiffs today.This is a big deal if it’s actually true. It could easily help Wright continue his “I’m Satoshi” schtick and win him some converts.But if it’s less than totally true, it would only be the latest weird, reality-bending twist in Wright’s already surreal and controversial story.In any case, that’s what Wright told courts today: he has the public keys associated with billions in crypto.Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, a Wright-led fork of Bitcoin Cash that purports to more closely adhere to the anonymous Bitcoin creator’s true ideas about cryptocurrency, surged today. The currency opened the day’s trading at $193.99 and rose as high as $447.13 before settling around $388.With the day’s gains approaching 100%, this has some calling Wright’s tactics a straight-up exit scam."

However, in order to pay taxes with Bitcoin online, the taxpayers will have to apply directly to the Zermatt Tax Office for a crypto payment solution, the announcement notes.Romy Biner-Hauser, the mayor of Zermatt, outlined that the new tax payment option aims to meet increased demand for Bitcoin-based tax payments:“An innovative, pioneering spirit is one of the trademarks of Zermatt, which is why we are happy to support residents in providing them with the solutions they require.”The city of Zug became the first in Switzerland to accept Bitcoin payments in 2016, Bitcoin Suisse said. As reported by Cointelegraph, the capital of Switzerland’s “Crypto Valley” began accepting Bitcoin payments for certain city services such as public utilities in May 2016. The payment was reportedly capped at 200 francs worth of Bitcoin.While Switzerland continues to expand its crypto-financial services industry in terms of Bitcoin-powered tax payments, some global authorities have recently deemed such an option too risky due to Bitcoin’s high volatility. On Jan. 8, lawmakers in the United States’ New Hampshire state legislature retracted a bill that would have allowed state agencies to accept crypto as payment for taxes. According to lawmakers the initiative was “inexpedient to legislate” as Bitcoin’s price is not stable."

Source: TradingViewThe price of Bitcoin is still moving inside this downwards channel since last year’s high of $13,900. Remarkably, the price corrected towards the “Golden Pocket” Fibonacci area (0.618-0.65 level) and is currently showing a potential higher low. The green area is also a significant area from 2018, as that was the zone the price of Bitcoin bounced on for 6-months. Given that the price bounced from $6,900 to $7,400, there’s buying pressure shown from this area, indicating that the price might be bottoming inside this range. BTC USD 1-day linear chart. Source: TradingViewThe linear chart shows similarities with the log scale chart. However, there’s more of a falling wedge construction rather than a channel. Meaning that the price is gathering strength for a breakout through the coming weeks, marking this level as a bottom area. The chart is also showing a bullish divergence, which marked the temporary low at $6,500. Generally, bullish divergences mark a trend reversal (also seen in the December 20118 low at $3,100). If price maintains this red box as new support and a higher low is established, then Bitcoin could face a rally towards $9,000 over the coming months.Total market capitalization 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewSimilar signs show the total market capitalization chart, which has retraced to April 2019 levels. A test was confirmed by a sharp bounce upwards, followed by a potential higher low construction as we speak. Aside from these signals, a substantial bullish divergence potentially marked the bottom of this retracement. This retracement is currently hovering around the 0.618-0.65 Fibonacci level as well (similar to Bitcoin). If market capitalization can maintain this higher low and consolidate on this level, a breakout to the upside of this falling wedge looks more likely than further downside momentum. Crypto fear & greed index. Source: Alternative.meUsually, when an asset is marking a temporary top, the sentiment is euphoric and greed becomes palpable. The opposite effect is the case around bottoms. People are usually scared and depressed as they are expecting further downwards momentum. The Fear & Greed Index has been showing fear for the last weeks, indicating that the overall market sentiment doesn’t expect a breakout to the upside.The price is still moving south, which means that some fear is warranted in the market. However, as the price is trying to bottom here, it would be interesting to look at potential upside momentum rather than further downwards. The same can be spotted on altcoins, for example, Ethereum (ETH).ETH USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewThe ETH chart is showing a similar wedge formation as the Bitcoin and total market capitalization charts, meaning that a breakout to the upside is likely to occur in the next month. Aside from that, the price bounced from a support area here and is potentially making a bottom formation. ETH BTC 2-day chart. Source: TradingViewOn the BTC chart, many altcoins are facing a long term downtrend. Ether, for example, is in the midst of a 2-year old downtrend that it must break out of. Interestingly, the months of January/February have historically seen Ether price significantly increase and/or breakout of downtrends. During 2016, a similar breakout was shown, after which 2017 repeats the same move. First, a bottom formation includes a bullish divergence. After this, a higher low is marked, followed by a breakout to the upside.In 2018 and 2019, a significant move to the upside was seen in the ETH/BTC pair as well, though no breakout of the general downtrend occurred. This time it’s possible, however, as Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) are already breaking their downtrends that have been in place for two years.So what must Bitcoin price do now to generate such a breakout to the upside?BTC USD bullish scenario. Source: TradingViewAs discussed previously in the article, the price needs to maintain the blue area as a higher low and not drop below it. As long as that level is sustained as support, a breakout to the upside is likely to occur. This would cause the 6-month old downtrend to break to the upside, which potentially means the end of the downward momentum.The targets based on previous support/resistance and Fibonacci levels first include $8,000. If that’s broken, the price is ready to aim for $9,100-9,500, which would typically shift the sentiment from fear to neutral.BTC USD 1-day bearish scenario. Source: TradingViewA bearish scenario can be warranted through the opposite of the bullish scenario and is pretty basic. If the price of Bitcoin is not able to hold the blue area as support, the bullish divergence is not confirmed, and the price is ready to continue downwards. In that regard, a potential retest of the $6,900 level would grant an excellent short opportunity, and then the next support zones can be found in the $6,200-6,500 area. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

At press time, the pair traded at $7,875, having reached $7,980 and gaining 5% on the day.Wyckoff was the father of a whole new method of analyzing price performance, dubbed the Wyckoff Method. According to Mahmudov, who uploaded a chart to demonstrate Bitcoin’s position, the largest cryptocurrency has already put in a bottom.Tuesday’s spike to near $8,000, for example, was an “SOS” point for BTC/USD in Wyckoff terms. SOS stands for “sign of strength,” and typically follows a so-called “spring” event which sees a price low point. After the SOS, a slight retracement called a “back-up” should precede further gains, according to the model. Bitcoin price as analyzed using the Wyckoff Method. Source: Murad Mahmudov/ TwitterMahmudov did not comment on the extent to which he personally believed in the validity of the bull scenario, which would reverse a general downtrend for Bitcoin that began in June after reaching nearly $14,000. Following a late October bounce to $9,500, BTC/USD appeared to bottom out at $6,400 in mid-December, but not everyone is convinced that the floor has come and gone. In the run-up to Bitcoin’s block reward halving in May, another historically accurate price model, Stock-to-Flow, calls for a price of around $8,300.Mahmudov is well known for his highly optimistic views on where the Bitcoin price is heading. In August, he said accumulation — also the overarching term for Bitcoin’s current Wyckoff phase — was already happening.“Don't try to outsmart yourself on short timeframes, zoom out & think big. In my view, BTC is going to $100K per orangecoin,” he summarized at the time."

The document reads:“Although falling back to fear in the last couple of days, the market is certainly getting more bullish.”The index’s website explains that when it reaches extreme fear it means that investors are too worried which presents a buying opportunity, while when the tool shows extreme greed the market is probably due for a correction.

The paper reads:“The ‘safe haven’ narrative for Bitcoin is starting to become true. However, this short-term price action could also just be spurious correlation and a long-term evaluation must be taken into consideration.”As Cointelegraph explained in a recent analysis, many believe that Bitcoin is proving useful to the Iranian population as the conflict continues.Lastly, the report also notes that the activity on Bitcoin’s blockchain also showed a renaissance, with the number of transactions climbing 5% in a week as the transaction value grew by one-fourth over the same period of time. Also miner fees increased by over 40% and the number of active addresses increased by about 7.63%.Bitcoin’s outlook is becoming increasingly bullish as recent reports become ever more positive for the cryptocurrency.

In the unlikely event that XTZ retraced the entire rally from $1.231 to $2.246, the 200-DMA will most likely function as strong support. In the meantime, traders are advised to keep an eye on trading volume in the shorter time frames, and also watch to see if the RSI begins to turn down from the overbought zone or if the MACD begins to curl down towards the signal line.Tezos weekly price chart.

Pompliano, however, has not changed his stance on Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset. “I don’t think that my opinion has changed at all,” Pompliano said, adding: “The most important part of Bitcoin, when it comes to the global hedge, is the fact that it’s a non-correlated asset — meaning that, as stocks go up or down, Bitcoin doesn’t have correlation to that.” Mentioning May 2019 as an example, Pompliano said Bitcoin’s price even moved in the opposite direction of the traditional market’s S&P 500 index, as well as gold, amid trade wars and other worldwide market instability. Pompliano called this a negative-correlation for Bitcoin. “When you look at that correlation, that becomes really important as that kind of global hedge of instability,” he explained. “It’s a way for investors to diversify their wealth and add a layer of protection that, without Bitcoin, they don’t get elsewhere.”Bitcoin reportedly accounts for 50% of Pompliano’s capital, according to an interview with Cointelegraph in July 2019."

realistically sustain its 40% year-to-date gains. 13983 Total views.","Feb 8, 2020","Bitcoin (BTC) may have come within 2% of $10,000 this week, but its 40% gains in 2020 are now making traders bearish about the future. ","Speaking to Cointelegraph in a Market discussion on Feb. 7, two trading heavyweights highlighted what they consider to be the increasing potential for Bitcoin to lose value in the short term. Alameda Research co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried was undecided on Bitcoin’s trajectory, while Bitbull Capital co-founder Joe DiPasquale identified $6,800 as a bear target for BTC/USD.“I think if there is continued unrest — if things like coronavirus get worse… prices of gold and oil going up, I can see Bitcoin continuing to increase, and if not, then we could have a slide back to $6,800,” DiPasquale summarized.The debate came as markets celebrated another week of solid gains for investors in both Bitcoin and altcoins. As Cointelegraph reported, opinions remain mixed as to why Bitcoin has appreciated 39% since Jan. 1, with some considering global events as a catalyst and others highlighting Bitcoin’s solid technical fundamentals.Like fellow trader Tone Vays, DiPasquale acknowledged that ultimately, more global instability would mean less money available for investment in Bitcoin.When asked whether they agreed with bullish price forecasts for this year, notably Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee’s 197% increase within six months, neither DiPasquale nor Bankman-Fried were convinced.“If you were saying, ‘I expect a 10% increase on average over the next six months,’ that would be a reasonable claim, but 200%, that’s quite the bullish take,” Bankman-Fried said.He added that Lee, well known for his bullish Bitcoin price talk, was not taking the full range of technical indicators into consideration. Warning that BTC/USD could return to the $6,000 range meanwhile puts DiPasquale at odds with previous Cointelegraph guests, who said a retrograde step towards lows from December was unlikely. That camp includes veteran trader Peter Brandt, who said that “strong hands” controlling Bitcoin would aid sustained growth. Those waiting for $6,000 and under had “missed the bottom,” he warned last month."

However, due to low usage, the transaction backlog was cleared without difficulty and normal activity resumed.","Data available on advanced blockchain explorer Blockchair show that BCH block number 620025 was mined at 2:14 on Jan. 30. The next block, number 620026, was found at 7:33 of the same day with 6,950 transactions in 2.33 megabytes, an unusually high number. The following block carried 1,590 transactions in 0.56 megabytes, after which another block has seen a standard amount of about 100 transactions, with regular activity resuming.For comparison, according to Blockchain.com data, a Bitcoin (BTC) block on average carries about 2,000 transactions. Blockchair shows that Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, usually sees up to 500 transactions in a single block.This data means that Bitcoin Cash — which has an average block time of 10 minutes — has seen no new blocks for 5 hours and 19 minutes. Twitter user Whale Panda, a cryptocurrency enthusiast well known by the crypt community, pointed out earlier today that the number of transactions in the block makes it apparent how little use Bitcoin Cash sees:“BCH has so few transactions that after 5.5 hours of no block it still only fills up 2.3MB.”Cointelegraph has been unable to determine why the mining anomaly above took place. Slower than usual blocks occasionally happen on the Bitcoin blockchain as well, as shown by occasional reports on the matter.Earlier this week, the Bitcoin blockchain saw a stale block that was later pushed out of the main blockchain and resulted in a double-spend of about $3. The research arm of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX explained on Jan. 27 that this is unlikely to be the result of a malicious attack given the low value involved.Such an event is the opposite of a slow block, since it sees two blocks being discovered very near each other in time, resulting in the need for the community to choose one of the two. Such occurrences are also the reason why transactions are considered completely confirmed only after six blocks on the blockchain include them and not just one.Proof-of-work blockchains, due to the variety of their users and the random nature of the mining process, often show rare events recognized as occasional anomalies. For instance, in mid-November, Bitcoin’s blockchain mempool was at its highest level since January last year without the expected accompanying spike in transaction number.Another notorious case of an anomalous Bitcoin block is block number #528249, which had a hash that is very unlikely for a miner to compute. More precisely, it was found that there is about a 0.4699% chance of this block hash being discovered."

merchant payments from any Bitcoin wallet was driven by merchant ...","Feb 4, 2020","The leading provider of Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency payment services, BitPay, announced on Feb. 4 that the company will soon allow invoices to be paid from any Bitcoin wallet or exchange. ","BitPay CEO Stephen Pair told Cointelegraph that the decision to enable merchant payments from any Bitcoin wallet was driven by merchant feedback, putting control back in the hands of over 30 thousand active merchants currently using BitPay:“BitPay’s customers want to support all the Bitcoin wallets, just like they want to support all cryptocurrencies for payments. The company has decided to re-enable support for all wallets, which is referred to as plain vanilla peer-to-peer transactions.”Pair mentioned that a phased rollout to support all Bitcoin wallets has already begun. Once the feature has been implemented, merchants will be able to decide which wallets they will accept payments from, while consumers would be able to use any wallet to make purchases from those merchants.  Pair also noted that merchants can take advantage of peer-to-peer transactions without any required technical development or implementation, explaining:“We are going to automate the whole process for merchants, since we already have experience doing this already. It’s very important for merchants to support all Bitcoin wallets, as this will greatly expand their potential to grow sales and acquire new customers.”The decision to restore service to all Bitcoin wallets comes after BitPay’s rocky path towards success. When the price of Bitcoin was inching towards its all time high in 2017, Pair explained that BitPay was experiencing delays with almost 9% of customer payments. He noted that a number of customer support issues were being reported at this time, pushing the company to implement the payment protocol known as “BIP70.” He said:“At times, Bitcoin has been a victim of its own success. As adoption exploded in 2017 and 2018, network congestion and high transaction fees brought with them some tough decisions, like the one to implement Payment Protocol for all Bitcoin payments.”While BIP70 helped eliminate network congestion, it also limited users to certain Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH) wallets. According to a 2018 Reddit post, BitPay users complained that payments could not be made using some of the most popular wallets like Coinbase and Bitcoin Wallet.As BitPay begins to add support for all Bitcoin wallets, Pair mentioned that the platform will continue to use the JSON payment protocol, “as we have many wallets in the pipeline looking to support that.”Pair explained that BitPay implemented its JSON payment protocol in February 2018 (in addition to BIP70) as a result of customer support issues. The JSON payment protocol helped reduce BitPay’s error rates to nearly zero percent at the time.The dollar volume lost to cryptocurrency payment errors dropped dramatically from over 8% (in December 2017) to well under 1% of BitPay's total dollar volume processed.A company blog post announcing the JSON payment protocol explained that the interface provides for direct communication between a wallet and BitPay's servers, noting:“If a wallet submits an incorrect payment to BitPay, BitPay's servers will reject the transaction. This prevents any transactions which will result in a failed payment from reaching the Bitcoin blockchain and costing users unnecessary miner fees. We expect that this change will allow us to reduce payment errors to zero.”As for wallets that conduct normal Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash transactions, Pair noted that BitPay expects to see fewer payment errors and exceptions moving forward:“Merchants have increased opportunities for sales from millions of global wallet holders that have not implemented the payment protocol and consumers have more places to make purchases. As a result, mainstream adoption for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is on the horizon.”"

If BSV flips BCH again the altcoin will be the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $5.56 billion. To date, BSV is now up by 300% over the past ten days. It appears that BSV’s rally was primarily driven by the unconfirmed rumor that Bitcoin SV advocate Craig Wright received the private keys to the Tulip Trust. Wright remains in the midst of a lengthy court battle with the estate of former business partner Dave Kleiman and recently a Federal Court judge extended the time Wright has to turn over half of his Bitcoin holdings to the estate. This extension basically gives Wright until February to source the private keys to his Bitcoin holdings. The trust is rumored to contain 1.1 million Bitcoin, worth more than $9.5 billion at BTC’s current valuation. If this is true, investors and Bitcoin SV supporters might be buying BSV or swapping their current Bitcoin holdings for the altcoin under the assumption that Wright may liquidate his Bitcoin holdings on the open market in exchange for BSV. Traders will now watch to see if there is a continuation with BSV’s rally or if the price dumps abruptly over the coming days. Bitcoin weekly price chart.

According to a GitHub post by James Lovejoy, a researcher at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, the hard-fork of Bitcoin was hit by two deep reorganizations of over 10 blocks on Jan. 23 and 24.","A 51% attack is a situation where a single entity or group controls over half of the hashpower securing a blockchain. This then allows control over confirmation of new transactions, and the power to reverse completed transactions, allowing the double spending of coins.In the first attack, just after 18:00 GMT on Jan. 23, 14 blocks were removed from the blockchain and 13 then added. 1,900 BTG worth approximately $19,000 at the time were double spent in the redirect of one transaction.Just over six hours later, in the early hours of Jan. 24, another attack removed 15 blocks and added 16. 5,267 BTG ($53,000 at the time) were double spent in three transactions that were redirected.Bitcoin Gold uses the Equihash algorithm known as Zhash, in order to remain mineable on consumer graphics cards. Based on Nicehash market prices for Zhash, the estimated cost of each blockchain reorganization attack was around $1,700.The attacker would have recouped around the same value in block rewards, meaning that the attacks at least broke even, and were possibly profitable if the double spend was successfully extracted from the system.Following the attack, the price of Bitcoin Gold spiked. On Jan. 26, the coin moved from $10.42 to $11.60 in a matter of hours. At press time, the coin is up nearly 14% on the day to trade at $11.74.At the time of the attack, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance allowed trading of BTG deposits after six confirmations, and withdrawal after 12 confirmations. A 14 or 15 block reorganization would therefore have evaded both of these escrow periods.Binance has since increased its withdrawal requirement to 20 blocks, although this still does not preclude the possibility of a 51% attack being financially viable.As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin Gold was previously the subject of a 51% attack back in May 2018, when an estimated $18 million of BTG was overspent, leading to the coin being delisted on Bittrex."

He suggested that the traditional banking system is outdated:“You look at Bitcoin and you say 'Hey, this is great because it's not my father's Oldsmobile. Our banking system is the Oldsmobile, is the old Oldsmobile.’”Draper also blamed traditional finance for putting millennials into hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. He explained that “with the current salaries, they can't quite pay it off. It's a really difficult time, and they've become renters rather than buyers because they have to.” He also insisted on the importance of being “able to move freely and move capital and goods freely throughout the world.”Because of those reasons, Draper recommends millennials start building their “empire in the new model” that does not impose hefty fees and regulations on transactions, unlike the dollar. He pointed out that just setting money aside like older generations did won’t cut it in today’s economy, concluding:“I think if you really want it to work, I think you go bitcoin or crypto.”Many believe Bitcoin to be the solution to a highly inflationary and debt-based financial system. For Bitcoin to solve some of those problems, merchants would need to start setting prices in BTC, instead of their local currency. The reason being that if prices are set in the local fiat currency, inflation will still influence the prices of goods and services.As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, recent research suggests that a growing precision in the number of decimals for Bitcoin points to decreasing usage as a unit of account."

In a tweet-storm to promote an accompanying blog-post published Feb. 7, it covered the key reasons why the halving and subsequent supply rate reduction will further cement that link.","Since the gold standard was broken in 1971, the dollar’s value has declined and gold’s value, in dollar terms, has risen over 4000%. Gold has more value than similar metals such as copper due to its relative scarcity and difficulty to acquire.Bitcoin has been designed to be scarce like gold and is artificially difficult to acquire through the Proof-of-Work process of mining. However, it also has an advantage over gold in being transferable through a communications channel.Coinbase concluded:“Armed with a myriad of technological advantages, accelerating development, and maturing global market, Bitcoin is a store of value to rival gold in the digital age.”The supply of Bitcoin is limited by design, with new tokens being minted as a reward every time a block of transactions is mined. The initial reward level of 50 BTC per block has already undergone two halving events, bringing it down to the current 12.5 BTC per block.After the May 2020 halving, mining rewards for each new block, mined approximately every ten minutes, will reduce to 6.25 BTC. This will bring the supply issuance of Bitcoin to a rate of around 1.7% per annum.Stock-to-flow (S2F) is a measure of new supply rate over total supply, and post-halving, Bitcoin’s S2F scarcity will be on a par with gold’s.“Gold’s stock to flow is higher than any other metal commodity, and bitcoin is set to soon follow,” notes Coinbase. Bitcoin stock-to-flow chart. Source: medium.com/@100trillionUSD/S2F forecasts for the price will fail if there is no demand, and this holds true for fiat money, as much as any other commodity. As central banks increase the money supply, economies can sometimes prosper. However, if money supply overwhelms demand then hyperinflation events can occur.Such events drive demand for safe havens such as gold and Bitcoin, and recent economic fear is reaching all-time highs, according to the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index.This, along with Bitcoin’s myriad of technological advances and accelerating development, justifies Bitcoin’s title as digital gold, according to Coinbase.As Cointelegraph reported, senior employees of Coinbase and Ripple recently formed a working group to advise United States regulators on policies to encourage innovation in the sector."

In recent years, the idea that Venezuelans are turning to coins such as Dash has further come under scrutiny. As various commentators have noted, despite claims by ex-Dash Core Group CEO Ryan Taylor that the altcoin is the country’s most popular, overall cryptocurrency traction among merchants, in fact, remains low. Similarly, while P2P trading volumes for Bitcoin regularly hit new highs when denominated in Venezuela’s ailing Sovereign Bolivar, the data speaks more to the fiat currency’s weakness than Bitcoin adoption. Burger King’s experiments with Bitcoin have meanwhile fallen flat in the past. Various initiatives in Russia and Europe appeared to be short-lived, with acceptance disappearing soon after launch.

Customers can start using the app with as much as £50 ($65) and buy Bitcoin with bank cards or through a bank transfer. The funds are further processed through digital assets custodian BitGo.The app ostensibly allows users to credit funds almost instantly by means of a Faster Payments process. Ariane Murphy, head of communications and marketing at Mode, said that “the Mode app addresses transaction restrictions issues, low speed/high cost, lack of security and most importantly, tackles the poor user experience typically associated with Bitcoin apps.”Prior to using the app, Mode requires that users undergo a Know Your Customer procedure, which is carried out by AI-enabled identity verification technology.Founded in 2018, Mode — whose parent company is UK-based fintech firm R8 Group — opened a waiting list for the app last October, initially making it available via invitation only. Industry players have long been in search of ways to speed up slow Bitcoin transactions. The Bitcoin Lightning Network adds an additional layer to Bitcoin’s blockchain, enabling users to create payment channels between any two parties on that extra layer. This ensures almost instant transactions, with extremely low or even non-existent feesRecently, a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology revealed a new solution, which is able to notably reduce Bitcoin blockchain-based transaction times and even boost profits."

Source: CBO$1 trillion is more than six times the market cap of Bitcoin (BTC) and four times the market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. The data concerned Kling, who like other Bitcoin proponents has drawn clear distinctions between the cryptocurrency and fiat currency. As Cointelegraph reported, the deficit is not the only worrying aspect of U.S. economic policy to surface in numbers in recent months. Late last year, it emerged that the country’s total debt is now higher than ever at $23 trillion, while the world’s total debt is $255 trillion — or $12.1 million for each Bitcoin.In simple terms, budget deficits occur when the value of a country’s spending exceeds the value of its revenues. As Kling notes, governments can use fiat to plug the difference, allowing them to increase the money supply which they can then direct as desired.Over the New Year period, the Federal Reserve added $425 billion to the dollar supply.The process has its roots in Keynesian economics, which calls for states and central banks to “manage” the money supply instead of allowing the market to decide prices for goods and services. Such a setup creates a problem known as the “Impossible Trinity” — attempting to achieve free capital flows, a fixed exchange rate between currencies and independent monetary policy. “Imagine the allure as a politician of promising your constituents all the spending they want, w/o ever having to raise taxes. Spend more AND cut taxes! There's no inflation!” Kling wrote on Twitter.He concluded: “This has been tried many times before in monetary history and there is no example where it ended well.”As Saifedean Ammous explains in his book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” preventing “meddling” by governments and central banks would reverse the processes which lead to phenomena such as deficits. This is because fiat would cease to be money “by decree” as its name implies, and would instead operate without a central authority, similar to Bitcoin."

Due to this, jumping into cash just before the eventual market fall is ill-advised, according to Dalio.The billionaire still cautions balance, advising investors to hold “a certain amount of gold” in their portfolios.His stance on Bitcoin (BTC) was far more negative, however, noting that it is not currently functioning as money:“There’s two purposes of money, a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth, and Bitcoin is not effective in either of those cases now.”He added that the volatility of Bitcoin makes it unattractive for serious investment, while something like Libra could be a better option. Elaborating on his preference of gold as a store of value, he noted that central banks are some of the largest metal holders:“What are they going to hold as reserves? What has been tried and true? Are they going to hold Bitcoin digital cash… They’re going to hold gold. That is a reserve currency.”Bitcoin is often touted as “digital gold,” a reserve asset independent from government control.But while many believe in the store of value thesis of Bitcoin, its performance so far has not indicated meaningful correlation with global markets. While it does appear to have slightly positive correlation to gold, the indexes are small enough that they can be attributed to coincidence.These may still be teething problems due to the relative novelty of cryptocurrencies.

a Bitcoin-pegged token, which could lead to its use as collateral for ...","Feb 7, 2020","The RSK project announced the creation of Token Bridge, an interoperability protocol between the Bitcoin-pegged sidechain and Ethereum, on Feb. 6. It could have important implications for the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.","RSK is a smart contract platform attached as a sidechain to the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain. It uses a wrapped version of Bitcoin called rBTC as its native token. Users acquire the token by depositing BTC into RSK’s bridge wallet, which works as a two-way peg.The team has now opened a similar bridge for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows a two-way transfer of any token between the RSK and Ethereum ecosystems. This means that Ethereum users can transact with wrapped representations of RSK’s rBTC and RIF tokens, thus gaining indirect exposure to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The same goes for RSK users, who are exposed to Ethereum-based stablecoins such as DAI.When a user deposits a token from either blockchain to an address provided by RSK, an equivalent amount of the appropriate Side Token is minted in the other chain. The Side Token is written according to the ERC-777 specification, a newer token standard that is backward-compatible with the highly common ERC-20 specification.Any standard token on either blockchain can be ported to the other through the bridge. The total supply does not change from this operation, as the original tokens are locked up until their mirror image is redeemed.Cointelegraph reached out to Adrian Eidelman, RSK Strategist at parent company IOVLabs. He explained in more detail how the bridge works, revealing that the current system is not yet fully decentralized.Eidelman said that to connect the two blockchains together, a federation of “well-known and respected community members” oversees the peg process. The procedure is triggered when developers on either chain interact with the bridge smart contract. Using Ethereum as an example, he explained what happens:“The original tokens will now be locked on the Ethereum chain, and an “event” is created. At this point, the federation initiates the bridge and sends the information to the RSK chain. Once 50% or more of the federates have voted for the same transaction — the bridge on the RSK chain creates RRC20 tokens for the same amount locked on Ethereum.”The team does not consider this a fully decentralized measure, but Eidelman reassured that the system should reach “full decentralization” by the end of Q3 2020.The DeFi movement is largely limited to Ethereum and its token ecosystem, where it recently surpassed $1 billion in locked assets. ETH is used as the main collateral asset to generate the DAI stablecoin through its complex lending system. Nevertheless, Bitcoin-based DeFi is often considered DeFi’s next frontier. In a November 2019 interview with The Spartan Group, MakerDAO’s founder Rune Christensen said:“When it comes to a solid decentralized collateral, I think ETH is king. The only thing that can come close to ETH in terms of its importance is of course Bitcoin.”But Bitcoin has very limited smart contract functionality, which severely limits this use case. Christensen noted that porting Bitcoin into Ethereum would allow for it to be used as collateral, pointing to existing solutions such as Wrapped BTC (WBTC).However, WBTC’s transfer process is custodial, instead of being a decentralized atomic swap. He explained that “it is essentially impossible to build more decentralized cross-chain solutions.”The only available solution, according to Christensen, is to have many providers of Bitcoin on Ethereum:“The way that we have to try to solve that with Maker is rather than just for WBTC to be the sole source of Bitcoin on Ethereum, we want to have hundreds of different versions of wrapped Bitcoin.”Thus the release of RSK’s Ethereum bridge could be an additional step toward Bitcoin-collateralized DAI living on Ethereum.Though Maker is the biggest decentralized stablecoin provider, it is not the only one. Money on Chain is a similar project built on RSK, which uses rBTC for collateral. The project already expressed interest in using the RSK bridge to enter the Ethereum ecosystem. RSK also sees a potential use case for Ethereum DeFi to transfer to its platform. Eidelman claimed that the Ethereum market is “experiencing many difficulties,” pointing to higher fees and lower capacity. The project sees itself as an extension of Bitcoin, which it believes is the “strongest ecosystem in the blockchain space.” Despite the close association, RSK is still its own network.Bitcoin DeFi could be close, but it seems unlikely that it will be based on the Bitcoin blockchain."

2019 has been the failure of multiple Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded ...","Jan 26, 2020",One of the recurring themes in the digital asset markets across 2018 and 2019 has been the failure of multiple Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications to gain the approval of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.,"Each new application was met with anticipation, only to be dismissed for the same reason: concern over how the ETF would derive its price, whether this price could be manipulated, and if the listing exchange could adequately meet section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. This section states, in part, that:“The rules of the exchange are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade…” (17 USC 78f (b)(5)).Related: A Brief History of the SEC's Reviews of Bitcoin ETF ProposalsThe common thread between all of these applications was a plan to create the reference price — the price, at which assets are valued and benchmarked — from retail exchange data. For example, the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF’s reference price was to be based on the results of the Gemini retail exchange’s daily auction for spot Bitcoin. In the case of Bitwise, the reference price was based on a blend of data from several prominent retail exchanges.We believe that all prior ETF applications have failed to demonstrate their ability to meet the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) for several reasons:Related: Crypto Hacks: Crypto Exchange Hacks & Cryptocurrency HackersUnless this is addressed in forthcoming applications, we believe that it is extremely unlikely that any Bitcoin ETF that relies on the retail exchange market for a reference price will be approved anytime soon.Many people, especially those outside of the institutional crypto market, believe that retail exchanges represent the majority of the Bitcoin market. However, that’s not the case.Alongside retail venues, there is a vibrant, liquid over-the-counter (OTC) market for spot Bitcoin, whose participants are primarily institutional investors and professional market-making firms. While no one has come up with a precise measure of the size of the OTC market — most market makers do not publicly release trading volumes — a major study conducted by the Tabb Group in 2018 found that the OTC market is likely three to four times the size of the retail market. Moreover, this larger volume is spread across an estimated 30–40 active OTC market makers rather than several hundred retail exchanges.Related: Crypto OTC Trading, ExplainedAs with other areas of finance, trade sizes vary significantly between the institutional and retail markets. On retail exchanges, most trades are for fractions of a Bitcoin. In the OTC market, market makers have minimum trade size requirements that are typically in the $100,000-to-$200,000 range.We believe that the OTC market can provide a much more accurate and secure measure of pricing for Bitcoin ETFs, one that is far more likely to satisfy regulators. Above all, the OTC markets are far less susceptible to manipulation:Beyond the manipulability of the underlying market itself, it will also be critical in any ETF applications to show that the reference price is resistant to manipulation. One way to achieve this is by deriving pricing from a fixing window. Fixing windows is utilized with many traditional assets.How would a reference price derived through a fixing window of a few hours be secure? With a fixing window, any effects of showing false buying or selling interest to market makers will be highly diluted. The parties overseeing the price will be better positioned to recognize and exclude questionable prices that deviate from the average of all other contributors — again, sourcing pricing from a handful of OTC participants is far less laborious than working with a highly-fragmented retail market.The sweet spot for the number of OTC contributors to a pricing index is approximately from 10 to 15. At this level, with the right policies in place, even a handful of market makers colluding together would have difficulty influencing the index by more than a non-meaningful percentage.We believe that the correct path forward in securing approval for a Bitcoin ETF is not to repeat the retail-based pricing model. Continued rejections and the little effort made to address regulatory concerns demonstrate the weakness of this approach. Rather, fund sponsors should look to the much more professional and far less vulnerable OTC markets. A pricing mechanism sourced through OTC markets are far more resistant to market manipulation and may give regulators the confidence needed to take an application forward.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Robert Emerson is the head of quantitative analysis at Tassat, overseeing all aspects of product design and modeling, risk modeling and margin methodologies.

A proprietary injunction is an order which prevents a person from dealing with their own assets when it is subject of a proprietary claim.,"On Jan. 17, the UK High Court released documents concerning a ransomware attack, in which over 1,000 computers of the insurance company were rendered unusable through the use of malware that encrypted files, making them unaccessible. The unidentified attackers demanded $1.2 million in Bitcoin in exchange for decrypting the data.The firm’s insurer covered the client’s losses from cybercrime and agreed with the hackers to pay $950,000 in Bitcoin to decrypt the files, and received a tool to unlock them 24 hours after making the payment.Still, the company needed 10 days to restore all of its systems, including 20 servers and 1,000 desktop computers.The company’s insurer hired blockchain major analytics firm Chainalysis to track the ransom. The analysis revealed that most of the Bitcoin, 96 BTC had been immediately laundered through crypto exchange Bitfinex. The court required Bitfinex to provide any information concerning the holder of the account that received the ransom by Dec. 18, 2019.When Cointelegraph contacted Bitfinex, the firm did not clarify the status of the ransomers’ Bitcoin or what data was handed over to the court, stating:“Bitfinex has robust systems in place to allow it to assist law enforcement authorities and litigants in cases such as this. In this case we have assisted the Claimant to trace the stolen Bitcoin and we understand the focus of the Claimant’s attention is no longer on the Bitfinex platform. It now appears Bitfinex is an entirely innocent party mixed up in this wrongdoing.”According to a Jan. 25 report from New Money Review, the case is still ongoing. Darragh Connell, the insurance company’s legal representative, said, “Return hearings of the interim injunction will be heard again in due course before Mr Justice Bryan who has reserved the case to himself [...] As this is only the interim stage, my client’s claim will need be determined after a trial in the Commercial Court in London.”Ransomware attacks are a major cybersecurity threat and are becoming increasingly advanced. As Cointelegraph reported in early December 2019, Texas-based data center provider CyrusOne paid a $600,000 ransom in BTC in such an attack.In June 2019, hackers managed to infect the systems of the city council of Riviera Beach with ransomware and encrypt government files. Florida agreed to pay $600,000 worth of Bitcoin to the hackers."

decimal precision of outputs is increasing, reveals a BitMEX research 
report.","Jan 27, 2020","A growing precision in the amount of decimals for Bitcoin (BTC) points to decreasing usage as a unit of account. This is one of the conclusions of a Jan. 27 report by BitMEX Research, which analyzed transaction outputs for the past decade.","The report evaluated a total of 1.3 billion outputs, amounting to 5.4 billion BTC worth $12 trillion. Each transaction was categorized by its degree of decimal precision — what is the last non-zero value in a payment. Over 70% of Bitcoin outputs currently use the highest degree of precision possible of one satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), while in 2012 this figure amounted to 40 percent.Precision of Bitcoin outputs. Source: BitMEX Research reportThe report explained several anomalies seen in the chart. Bitcoin’s first two years of life show the prevalence of coinbase outputs, which generate new coins. The block reward amounted to 50 BTC with very few other transactions.An uptick in 10 satoshi transactions at the beginning of 2013 corresponds to the rise of Satoshi Dice, a gambling game.Finally, the anomalous spike in summer 2015 is attributable to the July 2015 flood attack, which stress-tested the network.One of the ultimate goals of Bitcoin adoption is its usage as a unit of account, where all payments are denominated in BTC, instead of U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies. However, the report explains that the continuous rise in output precision is the opposite of increasing direct usage. According to the analysts:“If unit of account status is achieved or becomes more prevalent, then presumably the degree of precision should reduce rather than increase.”Several factors are identified as potential causes. One is the “experimental” use of Bitcoin in its early days, which included users testing their first coins, or on-chain gambling and gaming.As exchange markets and usage matured, the analysts argue that a higher degree of precision became necessary.Despite the rise in the Bitcoin price, one satoshi is still worth less than one thousandth of a cent. It appears unlikely that fiat-denominated payments would require such an extraordinary amount of precision. Transaction fees could play a part in this. The change returning to the sender in a transaction usually has a higher precision due to the need to subtract the fee, which is calculated in satoshis per byte.The report highlights this as a possible privacy improvement. As the amount of high-precision transactions increases, it becomes more difficult to understand which part is the actual money sent, and which is the change.The analysts divided Bitcoin into three adoption phases: medium of exchange, store of value and unit of account. Noting that even the first step of medium of exchange is still ongoing, they concluded:“At least for now, unit of account status, is still somewhat of a fantasy.”"

to introduce a tax on block rewards to fund development, amid ...","Jan 24, 2020","Leading Bitcoin Cash (BCH) personalities, including Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver, proposed on Jan. 22 an “infrastructure funding plan” that would see miners donate 12.5 percent of all block rewards to a Hong Kong entity. Many in the community turned harsh critics of the proposal.","The fund would be used to promote Bitcoin Cash development, which the miners argue is a “far better solution” than having independent “corporate donors,” such as the Blockstream company for Bitcoin (BTC).The initial funding would be activated in May 2020 and run for six months. The expected revenue, based on current prices, would be approximately $6 million. This money would be donated for management to a Hong Kong corporation. It is worth noting that the proposal would activate around the scheduled reward halving. With current block rewards, the revenue would amount to about $13 millionPublished by the CEO of the Btc.top mining pool, Jiang Zhuoer, the post revealed that the proposal is supported by Jihan Wu, who controls the Antpool and BTC.com pools; Haipo Yang, from ViaBTC; and Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com.Together, they account for approximately 27 percent of BCH’s hashrate, with the majority being in the hands of unknown miners.One of the more controversial aspects of the proposal is a stated willingness to “orphan” blocks of miners who do not comply. Orphaning blocks is the practice of removing blocks from the chain and is generally similar to a 51 percent attack. Zhuoer revealed in a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) that the organizers would divert some of their BTC hashrate, of which they hold 30 percent, to ensure compliance.Many in the Bitcoin Cash community criticized the decision for a number of reasons.The primary concern is about centralization. The funds would be routed to a corporation, instead of a nonprofit foundation. The absence of any kind of voting procedure would mean that the owners of the company would have control over all Bitcoin Cash development, the community argues.Some also levied concerns of Chinese government interference. Profitability issues were also mentioned, as the “tax” would directly affect the amount of revenue going to miners.Amaury Séchet, a Bitcoin Cash developer, defended the proposal arguing that due to the nature of mining, it is not compulsory. However, he conceded that control of the funds is an important issue. Séchet proposing a committee of people with a “proven track record” of supporting the project, which would include himself.In the AMA, Zhuoer gave vague answers to questions of governance, saying that those details “are under discussion.” But he reiterated that, even though the details may change, the mining tax will still be introduced.Bitcoin.com and Btc.top representatives did not immediately reply to Cointelegraph’s inquiries."

It is designed to make payments instant and practically free for the user via transactions that are made off-chain. Dorsey has remained committed to introducing the technology to both Twitter and Square. Last month, Square gained a patent dedicated to real-time crypto-to-fiat currency swaps.He has also invested directly in Lightning Labs, the company developing the Lightning protocol and related products. Earlier in February, the firm confirmed it had raised $10 million in a Series A funding round. “If you think of the Visa network as this payment layer for, say, when people are transacting with dollars, Lightning is doing that for Bitcoin,” CEO Elizabeth Stark told Yahoo!

We would never do that and in fact, we’ve taken steps to lock up most of the XRP we own in escrows so we can’t touch it.”The comments jar with Ripple’s own market moves in 2019 and before. As Cointelegraph reported, the company has long been selling off XRP in bulk, with last year seeing it rid itself of more tokens than ever. At the start of 2020, the company released 1 billion XRP, worth around $200 million, from escrow as part of a planned operation.XRP itself meanwhile hit more than two-year lows in December, dropping below $0.20 and at one point trading 96% below its all-time high of $3.40. A recovery, including 9% gains in the past 24 hours, has since sent XRP/USD back above the $0.20 barrier.XRP 7-day price chart. Source: Coin360Garlinghouse continued to surprise. Despite Ripple’s token share, he strongly denied the company could influence the XRP price.“Oh no,” he protested when asked about the possibility, likening the situation to major Bitcoin (BTC) investors:“Ripple can’t control the price of XRP any more than the whales can control the price of Bitcoin.”Nonetheless, he said, Ripple would not respond well to other major investors owning a significant share of the XRP supply. In what appeared as a wish to nevertheless influence the market, Garlinghouse positioned Ripple as the enduring major token holder going forward.“There are times when we work with institutional investors or might say, ‘Hey, we want to buy $10 million of XRP,’ and we would have lock-ups to prevent them from dumping on the market,” he continued.Concluding, the executive said that such interventions were nonetheless “hypothetical:”“We don’t want some other party buying a whole lot of XRP and dumping it on the market, and so we would hypothetically have restrictions about what they could sell and how often, and usually those are based on volume in the market.”"

However, Wales responded with a tweet on Feb. 7, saying:“Your marketing materials need to be updated immediately — as people seem to be reading this as some kind of endorsement from me.  I'm coming to speak my mind, which includes that BSV offers nothing for Wikipedia and that there is zero chance we would ever use it.”The tweet has been liked by over 1,000 people at press time and has aroused mixed reactions throughout the crypto community as some commentators questioned Wales’s intention to attend the conference.Just recently, Bitcoin SV performed a scheduled upgrade named Genesis on Feb. 3, which resulted in a minor chain split where two versions of BSV exist at the time. Genesis changes many of the consensus rules for BSV to remove all remaining limitations.The block size is now effectively unlimited. Instead of being hard-coded in the node software, the block size limit is now a parameter that miners can reduce manually. Many other limits were raised as well, such as the maximum size of a transaction or the number of owners for a multisig wallet.While Bitcoin Cash is the first major hard fork of Bitcoin created back in August 2017, Bitcoin SV is a subsequent hard fork of Bitcoin Cash and associated with the self-proclaimed creator of Bitcoin, Craig Wright, who has recently been accused of confusing the ongoing trial proceedings."

Tarbert said:In the United States, the CFTC is responsible for regulating commodities, while securities fall under the Securities Exchange Commission. At the same time, the chairman has apparently for the first time expressed his thoughts about XRP — the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Which is to say, the CFTc remains unsure.According to Tarbert, the regulatory status of XRP is still unclear so far, despite the CFTC work with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to “to really think about which falls in what box” over the past year. Tarbert said:“We’ve been working closely with the SEC over the last year or so to really think about which falls in what box because I think if I hear anything from market participants it’s that we really need clarity. That without clarity it’s really difficult to figure out how these will eventually be regulated.”Additionally, the CFTC chairman also reiterated his positive stance towards the market of digital assets, noting that the authority has been actively contributing into the market. Tarbert noted:“In many ways, what we are regulating, we are creating a market for digital assets, so we are allowing digital assets — the ones that fall within our jurisdiction which is, primarily, they have to be a commodity.”The chairman continued to say that by allowing cryptocurrencies to “come into the world of the CFTC,” the regulator is allowing the futures market to develop based on these products. According to Tarbert, the CFTC is gradually helping to legitimize the market as well as add liquidity to the digital currency market by providing it with the features of the futures market like price discovery, hedging, risk management and others.Heath Tarbert, who succeeded former CFTC chairman Christopher Giancarlo in July 2019, said for the first time that Ether was considered by the regulator as a commodity in October 2019. The CFTC previously made a similar statement about Bitcoin in March 2018.Meanwhile, the regulatory status of XRP has been unclear so far, particularly after Ripple, the company behind the token, faced a class-action lawsuit alleging that it held an unregistered sale of securities. Reportedly filed in 2018 and having gained traction in August 2019, the suit claims that Ripple misled investors and sold XRP as an unregistered security in violation of federal law.Subsequently, Ripple filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in early December 2019, claiming that the case is contradictory and “self-defeating.” Previously, Cointelegraph published an expert take on the complicated regulatory status of XRP.Cointelegraph contacted Ripple regarding the recent CFTC chairman’s statement on XRP’s unclear regulatory status but had yet to receive a response as of press time.

Their correlation, as Cointelegraph previously noted, now looks much less convincing. “For a time being, it appears, on the daily candle chart, that a retracement down should occur due to the metal being overbought,” Kitco quoted analysts at Swiss-based trader Dukascopy as saying on Monday.They added that XAU/USD could drop further to support at $1,500 in the short term.The underwhelming progress for gold piles added pressure on those who privilege the precious metal over Bitcoin.Schiff, a well-known crypto detractor, said in November that BTC/USD was exhibiting a so-called “head-and-shoulders” price pattern and would soon drop to just $1,000, its lowest since early 2017. “The right shoulder is now shrugged and the neckline slanted and parallel to the shoulders. If it breaks the price objective for the dump is $1,000 to complete the pattern,” he claimed on Nov. 21 when the pair traded at around $7,800.Not only has the omen not come true, but it is Bitcoin which has already firmly beaten gold as an investment opportunity just two weeks into the new year.

Source: WoobullFor Szabo, Bitcoin’s impressive risk-adjusted returns go hand in hand with its very nature as a decentralized form of hard money which is free from manipulation by governments and central banks.He summarized: “Successful Bitcoin holders have low time preference & judge over extended periods, e.g. risk-adjusted return over 4-year holding periods. If an economist has not researched this strong market signal for explanations of supply & demand, they don't have a useful opinion about it.”Time preference refers to how a person either saves money, knowing it will allow for a better life in terms of wealth in the future, or spends and borrows it out of uncertainty over its value. As Cointelegraph previously reported, Bitcoin’s simple gains since its inception already made it the leading investment of the 2010s. At nearly 9,000,000%, the cryptocurrency has more than proven itself to its earliest “hodlers” in terms of returns.By comparison, risk in the investment options included by Woo stems from their susceptibility to react to third party meddling, Szabo meanwhile continued. For example, emerging currencies, in particular, react to the dollar, which in turn is not allowed to develop according to free-market conditions, as the Federal Reserve “manages” it.Szabo concluded:“Dollar prices of assets are very dependent on the subjective decisions the Fed makes about interest rates, money supply, asset financing and asset purchases, so you should ask them to predict what their own behavior would be in such a circumstance. Even they can't predict that.”Similar arguments for a central tenet of Saifedean Ammous’ popular book, “The Bitcoin Standard,” which focuses on fiat currency’s weakness due to governments refusing to allow free markets.At the next halving in May 2020, Bitcoin’s inflation rate is expected to drop to 1.8% — below that of both gold and the Fed’s target for the U.S. economy, further increasing its potential risk-adjusted returns."

The rationale that the increase in people using a platform makes its value increase exponentially — as it happens with Facebook or the App Store — is applied to cryptocurrencies at large: The more people that hold a crypto asset, the bigger increase in market value.","Further reports have suggested that these companies intend to launch their coins after Facebook’s Libra introduction to the market. Some of these companies have been the darlings of the stock market, but recent shifts in consumer preferences show that a segment of the population (i.e., millennials) already prefer investing in Bitcoin instead of FAANG stocks like Netflix. While this is intriguing, the question is: Are investors better off investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies than in FAANG stocks?Cryptocurrency market weekly overview. Source: Coin360XRP is one of the most mature coins in the market, being a top currency since August 2013 alongside Bitcoin. Even though Ether (ETH) is a more recent currency, it has achieved a top position in the market since August 2015 due to its unique applicable features. However, if an investor bought each of these three currencies in January 2017, XRP would have retrieved the highest return — 440% at the end of 2019.During the same period, Ether returned 379% to investors, while Bitcoin offered the worst performance of the three with a cumulative return of 301%. This strategy does not include the price spikes that occurred during this time, which could have made an investor extra profits and consequently could switch the order of performance shown. The method simply relies on a straight investment strategy of buying each on Jan. 1, 2017, and selling it on Dec. 31, 2019.January 2017–December 2019 cumulative returns for the top three cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ether and XRP)Analyzing the same currencies from a risk-adjusted performance, Ether is the best option for investors to take advantage of its high price gain (annualized mean return) while accounting for its volatility (annualized standard deviation) at a 0.84 Sharpe ratio — a risk-adjusted performance for investor to evaluate the risk/return reward of an investment — which is a suboptimal performance (i.e., a Sharpe ratio under 1).In this scenario, Bitcoin comes second with a 0.81 Sharpe ratio, while XRP offers the worst option with a 0.75 Sharpe ratio. All the measures are under 1, meaning that investors may be taking too much risk for the return they are getting by investing in either of these cryptocurrencies.Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin, Ether and XRPIf the same investors chose to buy FAANG stocks instead of cryptocurrencies in January 2017, they would have a lower cumulative return at the end of 2019 no matter which tech company was chosen.However, if that company is Apple (AAPL), an investor would yield the best return at 197%, followed by a 196% return from Netflix (NFLX). Amazon (AMZN) is still a great option, providing a 190% return, and Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG) yielded 158% and 155% respectively.January 2017–December 2019 cumulative returns for FAANG stocks (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google)FAANG stocks offer a lower price gain than cryptocurrencies, but they do provide better risk-adjusted performance than any of the three top cryptocurrencies — Facebook being the exception to the rule. When looking at Sharpe ratios for each FAANG stock, Apple offers the best chance to generate higher returns when accounting for its risk exposure with a 1.59 Sharpe ratio, almost twice the ratios displayed by Bitcoin or XRP.Amazon shows the second-best option for investors with a 1.33 Sharpe ratio, followed by Netflix at 1.04. These three stocks present Sharpe ratios over 1, which means they are giving investors a fair to good return based on the risk they are vulnerable to.However, investors looking into Google or Facebook will be more prone to risk and not necessarily get the return they would expect at that risk level because they both show Sharpe ratios under 1. Nonetheless, Google is still a better risk-adjusted option (with a 0.95 Sharpe ratio) to invest in than Bitcoin, Ether or XRP.Sharpe ratio for each FAANG stockPrevious reports show that Bitcoin was a better risk-adjusted option than investing in United States stocks or gold after BTC’s halving. However, when looking at FAANG stocks in detail and during a more recent time period (between 2017 and 2020), we find the opposite results. Nevertheless, Bitcoin, Ether and XRP still offer a better overall return for the period analyzed but a lower risk-adjusted return than FAANG stocks.Curiously, Facebook, the only tech company with detailed plans to launch its own cryptocurrency (i.e., Libra), shows the second-lowest cumulative return and the worst risk-adjusted performance of all the FAANG stocks.For younger audiences, the awareness of tech companies such as Facebook or Apple and the heavy use of their products make them an attractive investment option at first sight. In this linear analysis, they seem to pose direct competition to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and show a better risk-adjusted performance in recent periods.From a traditional finance point of view, an investor would prefer to invest in a FAANG stock due to the risk-return reward. However, the higher cumulative returns — double in some cases — offered by either cryptocurrency analyzed can tempt enthusiasts and younger audiences to still focus on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

Thus, in mid-October, U.S. authorities shut down one of the largest-to-date child sexual exploitation market called Welcome to Video. To identify the criminals, the investigators used tools developed by analytic company Chainalysis, which helped to track the BTC wallets, used by the criminals to receive payments from customers.As Cointelegraph reported last month, Russia’s largest darknet marketplace Hydra revealed that it is looking to raise $146 million in a token offering that would allow it to go global."

DMG operates as an industrial scale crypto mine hosting company, allowing clients to mine crypto through equipment stationed at its facilities in Northwest Canada. DMG’s COO Sheldon Bennett said that “DMG made a decision to focus on attracting large scale hosting clients as profitable crypto-mining is a function of creating cost efficiencies, and our mining facility is well suited for industrial miners.”Last October, DMG and Bitmain entered an exploratory agreement, under which DMG has been managing Bitmain’s Texas-based facility and set up nearly 15,000 next-generation miners.In November 2018, DMG energized its new crypto mining facility, stating that the facility would start at 60 megawatts, and can expand its capacity up to 85 megawatts. The 27,000 square foot crypto mining-as-a-service operation occupies an area of 34 acres and is ostensibly one of the biggest such operations in North America.Since the facility uses hydroelectric power — of which there is a surplus in Canada — the operation reportedly does not affect the power needs of local residents.On Jan. 8, digital currency mining firm Riot Blockchain began deploying around 3,000 new units of S17 Pro Antminers purchased from Bitmain as part of the full upgrade of its Oklahoma City mining facility.Riot anticipates that, following the deployment of all 4,000 next-generation miners, its aggregate operating hashrate at the Oklahoma City mining facility will reach approximately 248 petahash per second, representing a 240% increase in hardware power efficiency compared to its mining hashrate."

Strip in Palestine — is allegedly upping its Bitcoin fundraising activities.","Jan 20, 2020",A militant group with ties to the Iranian regime and Hamas — the de facto ruling authority of the Gaza Strip in Palestine — is allegedly upping its Bitcoin (BTC) fundraising activities.,"The spur for the increase is reportedly a slump in resources, compounded by Iran’s recent rejection of the group’s request for financial support. An analysis of the group’s activities was detailed in a cyber desk report from the IDC’s International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT), as reported by the Jerusalem Post on Jan. 19.The ICD-ICT cyber desk report claims there has been an “an irregular increase in the scope of activity” of a BTC wallet address (1LaNXgq2ctDEa4fTha6PTo8sucqzieQctq) it ties to the fundraising activities of the Hamas and Iran-affiliated “al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades,” the military wing of the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC). The PRC is a coalition of armed local groups, formed in late 2000, in opposition to what they perceive to be the overly conciliatory line taken by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Fatah towards the Israeli regime. The al-Nasser Brigades were active in both the 2008-9 and 2015 wars in Gaza and clashed with Israeli forces in Nov. 2018 in response to the killing of a PRC militant. The Brigades were also responsible for the high-profile kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Shilat in 2006, eventually freed as part of a prisoner exchange in 2011.According to ICT’s findings, a thorough review of the transactions associated with the wallet revealed that it served a “a seemingly legitimate financial website by the name of cash4ps,” which ostensibly enables the Brigades to send and receive funds out of the Gaza strip whilst ensuring a degree of anonymity to donors and beneficiaries.The report, which mapped the Brigade’s network of media platforms and various online fundraising strategies, ties the wallet address to a company allegedly identified as operating an account registered at the Islamic National Bank (INB). INB was blacklisted by the United States Treasury in 2010 due to its being controlled by Hamas, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization. It has also been declared illegal by the PA, the Palestinian Monetary Authority and the Palestinian Capital Market Authority.As of Dec. 1 2019, ICT claims that the total transaction volume in the wallet had hit 3,370 Bitcoin ($29 million at press time), having performed thousands of transactions over a four-year period. ICT  identified the company’s two physical addresses in the Gaza strip, as well as a key figure purportedly behind the fundraising scheme, Ramadan Alkurd (a.k.a. Wesam Ismael), whose ties to Hamas they traced and documented. An ICT representative has advised the U.S. government to designate all the accounts identified in the report as terrorist-affiliated entities, and to implement more robust regulatory and legal measures for Bitcoin exchanges in cooperation with international allies.Hamas’ financial isolation stems from its classification as a terrorist organization, in whole or in part, by several countries and international blocs — including the U.S. and the European Union. Having ruled the Gaza Strip since 2007, Hamas comprises a social service arm “Dawah” and a militant faction “Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades,” the latter of which initiated this year’s Bitcoin fundraising appeal.Russia, Turkey and China are among those who do not designate Hamas as a terrorist entity.As reported, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades has likewise allegedly availed itself of Bitcoin contributions, according to investigations by blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic and others."

As most nodes have not yet updated, this resulted in a minor chain split where two versions of BSV exist.","As reported by BitMEX Research, the upgrade occurred at block height 620,538, or about 8:30 PM EST. The subsequent block was considered invalid by old rules, signaling the hard fork.About one quarter of all blockchain nodes are still on the old version, meaning that these cannot synchronize to the main chain.Furthermore, a chain split occurred several hours later. The old chain was extended by one block, meaning that some miners have also failed to upgrade to the new rules.This does not appear to be a premeditated attempt at creating a new chain. With only one block added in more than 10 hours, only a very small minority of miners are left behind the old chain.Genesis changes many of the consensus rules for Bitcoin SV to remove all remaining limitations. The block size is now effectively unlimited. Instead of being hard-coded in the node software, block size is now a parameter that miners can reduce manually. This could potentially lead to issues down the line if not all miners agree to a particular value. A block bigger than the maximum allowed size for a certain group of users would be considered invalid by them. By default this setting is unlimited.Many other limits were raised as well, such as the maximum size of a transaction or the number of owners for a multisig wallet.The Bitcoin Script language now has a formalized grammar that will be checked by consensus participants. The upgrade has also restored OP_RETURN, an instruction for storing custom data on the blockchain.While the changes are seemingly minor, any modification to consensus rules always requires a hard fork."

This is the second major ETF withdrawal in recent months following similar actions by VanEck.,"Bitwise applied for ETF registration in January 2019. In March of the same year, it had released the Bitwise Report on exchange volume, claiming that 95% of trading volume is fabricated. The finding was used by the company as an argument for the SEC to accept the ETF. By disregarding the majority of the exchange volume, the firm maintained that price formation for BTC occurred mostly on regulated exchanges.The reasoning did not convince the commission, which rejected the proposal in October 2019. One month later, however, the regulator decided to review its decision.Matt Hougan, global head of research at Bitwise, explained to Cointelegraph why the ETF was withdrawn:""This is the next step towards our long term goal of bringing a bitcoin ETF to market, and we plan to refile our application at an appropriate time. We are currently working hard on answering the questions that the SEC raised in its 112-page response to our initial filing. We remain fully committed to the development of a bitcoin ETP.""A high-profile proposal by VanEck followed a similar path as the firm retracted its application in September 2019.An ETF is a stock-like fund tracking a particular asset or index of assets. Its shares can be freely traded during the day and generally closely follow the underlying asset’s price. A Bitcoin ETF would thus enable institutional and retail investors alike to gain direct exposure to the currency — while trading within the bounds of regulated traditional exchanges.There were many historic attempts at registering a Bitcoin ETF, but they were always rejected by the SEC. Their primary concerns remain those of difficult custody and the potential for market manipulation.

Source: TwitterIn April 2018, Lewis launched legal action against Facebook, accusing the social network of defamation related to deceptive cryptocurrency advertisements. At the time, Lewis claimed that the social networking giant has published more than 50 crypto-related ads with illicit use of his face and name to promote phoney financial products.Eventually, Facebook reached a settlement with Lewis to launch a dedicated tool to report scam ads, donating 3 million British pounds ($3.9 million) to a Citizens Advice project to help tackle similar practices.Both Facebook and Instagram had previously introduced bans on crypto-related ads. In January 2018, Facebook updated its advertising policy, announcing that it prohibits ads that use “misleading or deceptive promotional practices” that contain ads of crypto and initial coin offerings.However, the social media giant eased the ban in May 2019, around one month before releasing the white paper for its own cryptocurrency project, Libra, in June. This subsequently triggered a wave of fake Libra accounts on both Facebook and Instagram, as reported by Cointelegraph in July."

The pair will turn negative if the price drops below the critical support at $7,856.76. The traders can trail the stops on their long positions to $8,200, which can be tightened further if the price dips below the 20-day EMA. Ether (ETH) surged above the $173.841 to $180 resistance zone on Jan. 30 but the bulls have not been able to build on the strong up move. The price has reversed direction from $186.969. ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThere is a strong support at $173.841, which is just below the 200-day SMA at $175. If this support breaks, we expect the bulls to defend the 20-day EMA at $166. If the price bounces off either of these support levels, the bulls will make another attempt to move up to $197.75.  Contrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the next support to watch out for is the $157.50 to $150 zone.

Contradictory statements surround Novogratz's relationship with XRP, ...","Feb 6, 2020","Controversial altcoin XRP is still “proving” itself, but Bitcoin (BTC) remains the recommended investment choice in the cryptocurrency world, Mike Novogratz says.","In a series of tweets on Feb. 6, venture capitalist Novogratz, who is also CEO of the cryptocurrency merchant bank, Galaxy Digital, delivered modest praise of XRP and Ripple, the company which owns more of it than anyone else.“This year the broader alt market, including $XRP has outperformed $BTC.  This has surprised me,” he wrote.   “That said, I see more and more large accounts getting educated and set up to be accumulators of $BTC and believe on a risk-adjusted basis it’s the best place to bet on crypto.”Novogratz was posting a day after making thinly-veiled criticism of XRP and Ripple at TD Ameritrade’s National LINC 2020 conference in Florida. Forecasting XRP would “underperform immensely” in 2020, his comments garnered criticism from Ripple, with crypto news outlet CoinDesk quoting a company source who said Novogratz “doesn’t understand how Ripple manages its stake in XRP.”As Cointelegraph reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently raised eyebrows when he suggested the company would seek to prevent XRP from operating in a free market. Major shareholders commandeering the supply were not desirable, he told mainstream media last month. Novogratz nonetheless praised both Garlinghouse and Ripple’s activities, adopting a tone that appeared to contradict the previous day’s skepticism. “GLXY is a big investor in Ripple Labs. I would like to see them do well. @bgarlinghouse has done a great job as CEO,” part of another tweet read.He added that he personally had been “almost solely long $btc for the past 15 months,” and on Wednesday predicted $10,000 was incoming for BTC/USD.XRP maintained higher levels above $0.28 at press time, amid an altcoin surge which saw some major tokens gain as much as 25% overnight.Earlier in the week, derivatives giant BitMEX began offering an XRP perpetual swap, leading to firmly tongue-in-cheek comments from CEO Arthur Hayes."

As such, the two major crypto trading platforms are allegedly responsible for acquiring over a half of all illicit Bitcoin in 2019, while all other exchanges combinedly received 47.8%.Cryptocurrency exchanges receiving illicit Bitcoin in 2019. Source: ChainalysisAccording to the study, Binance and Huobi received illicit Bitcoin from 300,000 individual accounts associated with criminal activity in 2019. On top of that, less than 1% of those accounts were responsible for receiving the bulk of illicit Bitcoin. According to Chainalysis, just 810 accounts received 75% of illicit Bitcoin on Binance and Huobi in 2019.Chainalysis analysts suggested that many of those large illicit accounts likely represent over-the-counter (OTC) brokers. As OTC trading envisions trading deals that happen directly between two traders and without the supervision of exchanges, some OTC brokers may specialize in providing money laundering services to criminals, Chainalysis said.The company further noted that OTC brokers usually have looser Know Your Customer (KYC) standards than other exchanges, which is attractive for criminals:“The problem, however, is that while most OTC brokers run a legitimate business, some of them specialize in providing money laundering services to criminals. OTC brokers typically have much lower KYC requirements than the exchanges they operate on. Many of them take advantage of this laxity and help criminals launder and cash out funds, usually first by exchanging Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into Tether as a stable intermediary currency before they presumably cash out into fiat.”Out of the top 100 OTC brokers that allegedly provide money laundering services, as manually identified by Chainalysis, as many as 70 are in the group of Huobi accounts receiving Bitcoin from illicit sources. Dubbed “the Rogue 100,” the list of OTC brokers includes “extremely active traders who have a huge impact on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.According to Chainalysis, the Rogue 100 received gradually increasing amounts of crypto each month since late 2017, but their activity skyrocketed in 2019. Specifically, those traders received more than $3 billion worth of Bitcoin in 2019, while a substantial number of them were involved in alleged $3 billion Chinese Ponzi scheme PlusToken. The traders in the list allegedly account for as much as 1% of all Bitcoin activity per month.Speaking to Chainalysis, Binance’s chief compliance officer Samuel Lim reportedly said that the crypto exchange is committed to tackling financial crime in crypto. Lim noted that Binance is compliant with rules and KYC requirements of every jurisdiction they operate in. The exec added that the exchange will continue to expand its own technologies to combat money laundering and other illicit activities facilitated via crypto:“We will continue to improve on our proprietary KYC and AML technology, as well as the third-party tools and partners we work with, to further strengthen our compliance standards.”Cointelegraph contacted Huobi exchange to comment on the news but had yet to receive a response as of press time.

forfeit 50% of his Bitcoin to the Kleiman estate because his holdings ...","Jan 13, 2020",A United States District Judge has ruled that a previous sanction ordering Craig Wright to give up half of his Bitcoins to the estate of Dave Kleiman will not stand.,"U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart’s delivered the sanction ruling last August in the long-standing court battle over an alleged 1.1 million Bitcoins which were mined by Wright and Kleiman in partnership in the early days of Bitcoin, shortly after Wright claims he invented it.According to court documents filed with a U.S. district court in Florida on Jan. 10, Judge Beth Bloom ruled that Reinhart’s earlier sanction order was not proper.As Cointelegraph reported, in August 2019, Reinhart ruled that Wright had perjured himself by presenting falsified documents, and recommended that he hand over 50% of the over 1 million Bitcoin he allegedly mined with Kleiman.However, the latest ruling states that this sanction was not proper, as the deemed facts (that Wright had an equal partnership with Kleiman) do not specifically relate to the discovery issue (a list of Wright’s Bitcoin holdings).Moreover, even if the court did accept the deemed facts, this discovery abuse would remain “uncured,” as the court still does not know how much Bitcoin Wright owns.Judge Bloom did conclude, however, that Wright had not made a good faith effort to comply with discovery orders and should still pay the Kleiman estate’s attorney fees.The Kleiman estate filed a motion requesting legal costs of $658,000 in November last year. This led Wright to immediately respond with a counter-motion, asking for this to be thrown out as both the hours worked and hourly rate were “unreasonable.”Wright is not off the hook regarding the Bitcoin yet though. The judge ordered that Wright has until Feb. 3, 2019, to inform the court if a “mysterious bonded courier” arrives with the final key slice so that he can access his Bitcoin holdings.The judge questioned the plausibility of Wright’s previous assertion that this courier would deliver the slice by January 2020. However, she did say that the court should indulge him the opportunity."

In 2019, Lewis settled a defamation suit against Facebook for similar Bitcoin (BTC) scam adverts.","Instagram says deceptive advertisements have no place on its platform and plans to continue improving its detection protocols for such content. Social platforms have been known to censor crypto-related content, instituting blanket bans on crypto ads on several occasions.However, Facebook has recently relaxed this policy amid the roll-out of its own digital currency project. The social media giant is one of the main backers of the Libra Association, which plans to release the Libra digital currency payment solution.While many of these fraudulent crypto investments use fake endorsements, there are also cases where well-known crypto figures publicize such cons as legitimate investments. The presence of such backing seemingly provides legitimacy for otherwise obvious scams that end up siphoning millions of dollars from unsuspecting victims.As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Bitcoin scam ads touting false endorsements from Martin Lewis are appearing once again on social media. Retweeting the scam ads now appearing on Instagram, Lewis warned the public to not fall victim to such obvious cons.The misleading adverts show a fake article from British tabloid Mirror with the title, “Martin Lewis lends a hand to British families with Revolutionary Bitcoin Home Based Opportunity.” No such article exists on Mirror, with the media outlet issuing warnings about similar phony content as far back as August 2018.The particular scam in question was red-flagged in late 2019. In an email to Cointelegraph, a spokesperson for Facebook, the parent company of Instagram, explained that the platform has a zero-tolerance policy for scam ads. According to the company spokesperson:“Misleading or deceptive ads of any kind, have no place on Instagram. Our Advertising Policies do not allow scam ads, and when we detect an ad that violates our Advertising Policies, we disapprove it. All ads are subject to our ad review system, which relies primarily on automated, and in some cases manual review to check ads against these policies. This happens before ads begin running.”The Facebook representative further went on to state that while some misleading content may slip through the cracks, platform users should report such ads: “We incorporate signals of negative feedback from people, such as people reporting, hiding, or blocking an ad, into our ongoing review process. When we find ads that try to get around our enforcement, we go beyond simply rejecting the ad. We disable ad accounts and remove their ability to advertise in the future.”Back in 2018, Lewis sued Facebook following the emergence of more than 1,000 scam ads featuring the financial expert. In 2019, the two parties settled the suit, with Facebook pledging to donate $3.9 million to Citizens Advice — a Scams Action service for the United Kingdom.The social media giant also agreed to create a unique tool for reporting scam ads in the U.K. Commenting at the time, Lewis remarked:“It shouldn’t have taken the threat of legal action to get here. Yet once we started talking, Facebook quickly realised the scale of the problem, its impact on real people, and agreed to commit to making a difference both on its own platform and across the wider sector.”Lewis isn’t the only person to sue Facebook because of Bitcoin scam ads. Back in mid-2019, Dutch billionaire John De Mol took legal action against the social media company over fraudulent cryptocurrency adverts using his image without permission.Related: Dutch Billionaire Yet Another Victim of Deceptive Crypto Ads, Sues FacebookAt the time, De Mol argued that the scam ads were damaging to his reputation and had defrauded victims of close to $2 million. The court sided with the Big Brother reality show creator, ruling that Facebook must make efforts to remove such content or face significant monetary fines.Scams featuring other public figures such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin, British actress Kate Winslet and Australian business mogul Andrew Forrest have also emerged in the past. Each ad campaign typically attempts to use the images of these well-known people to trick uninformed investors into putting money (or crypto deposits) into an elaborate scam.According to Alex Nguyen, founding partner at XNOVO legal — a firm specializing in contracts and business structuring litigation — holding social media platforms like Facebook liable for content published by users constitutes a slippery slope. In a private correspondence with Cointelegraph, Nguyen opined:“Subjecting the most ubiquitous social media platforms to secondary liability for their users’ illegal content or conduct is an arduous uphill battle, largely due to the broad application of the Communications Decency Act (‘CDA’) created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The CDA allows a social media platform to avoid secondary liability for a user’s illegal content if a third party user originated the illegal content and the social media platform and its services merely served as a ‘neutral tool’ for creating such content.” Nguyen argues that a court could include scam ads under the broad umbrella of third-party content. Thus, it is possible to liberally apply the protection afforded by the CDA to fraudulent cryptocurrency advertising.Apart from crypto scam ads, social media platforms have also come under criticism for allowing or failing to prevent the spread of misleading information, especially in the political scene. Facebook, in particular, continues to face backlash for its policies concerning political ads.As is the case with crypto ads, it appears the burden of confirmation rests with users and not with the content creators or publishers. Thus, it is of paramount importance for consumers of information to do their own research and not take all information found online as gospel truth.Reactions to the court ruling in the De Mol case raised questions about whether social media platforms like Facebook are fighting a losing battle against creators and publishers of misleading content. Facebook’s attorney, Jens van den Brink speaking to Bloomberg following the trial’s close quipped: “De Mol seeks a perfecting filter that doesn’t exist.”Even with enduring blanket bans on crypto-related advertisements, scammers are still able to publish deceptive investment content on social media platforms. This reality points to the possibility that the filters employed by Facebook and others are ill-suited to completely eradicating all instances of scam ads.As revealed by Facebook in its email to Cointelegraph, the company employs both automated and manual content review protocols. However, scammers are seemingly able to game these control systems, enabling their misleading content to find its way online. Facebook says it is taking steps to block fraudsters from publishing content on its platform. For Vikram Singh, managing director of enterprise blockchain firm Antier Solutions, fraudsters will always find a way to bypass social media filters. In an email to Cointelegraph, Singh remarked:“It cannot be overlooked that there are always ways around whereby changing some different terminology you can still bypass computerized algorithms. So in my opinion it is more of a case of when people get lured by immediate gains and which can happen in any industry so curtailing cryptos for the same can eventually become a roadblock in adoption and awareness of crypto and blockchain looking at the outreach of Facebook and Insta.”XNOVO’s Nguyen, however, believes that Facebook and other social media platforms could do more to stop the spread of misleading content. According to Nguyen, the current terms of use on social media platforms leads to termination of the account, which is not enough:“I think social media platforms are in the best position to implement better policies to identify and curb the continued proliferation of false or fraudulent cryptocurrency-related advertising ex ante, especially given their unfettered access to a tremendous amount of data, technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning) to make sense of all that data, and limitless resources.”Concerning fact-checking, endorsements by seemingly “trusted” individuals in an industry can sometimes provide legitimacy for the published piece of information, especially when the end-user does not possess sufficient knowledge about the sector in question. Thus, it becomes an even greater problem when well-known personalities contribute to the spread of misleading content by providing backing.While there are crypto scam ads with fake celebrity endorsements, there are also fraudulent advertisements promoted by “crypto celebs.” In late December 2019, a suspected Bitcoin scammer dubbed “LÈON” orchestrated an exit scam after defrauding victims of about 53 BTC (currently worth $424,000).Before the exit scam, some popular crypto personalities endorsed LÈON’s investment program via tweets and retweets. Following LÈON’s alleged abscondment, some earlier backers deleted tweets promoting the scam.“Fraud has more to do with ignorance and lack of knowledge than any social media channel as a medium. Most of these cases occur to users who lack specialized expertise necessary to distinguish legitimate from an illegitimate offer,” remarked Singh. Given the similarities in the scams adopted by these suspected crypto fraudsters, consumers need to employ more research, critical thinking and due diligence when making investment decisions."

The long-running legal dispute centers on the SEC’s allegations that Telegram broke the law by selling unregistered securities.An executive who served as the head of technology at Barclays — and co-founded the British challenger bank Starling — has unveiled plans to launch a multicurrency account for fiat and crypto in the first quarter of 2020. Mark Hipperson’s new venture, called Ziglu, is set to allow users to spend their funds using a Mastercard debit card — with cryptocurrencies converted instantly at the point of sale. Although the venture is only going to be available within the United Kingdom to begin with, Ziglu has applied to the Financial Conduct Authority to become an official issuer of electronic money. As well as enabling consumers to buy and sell foreign currencies at interbank rates, crypto purchases and sales are set to be available at the best price across multiple exchanges.With the likes of Libra knocking on its doorstep, the European Central Bank seems keen to launch its own digital currency. But according to a brand-new working paper, the organization wouldn’t want such a coin to be too attractive to consumers. A newly released document concludes that there are pros and cons to launching a central bank digital currency, but warns that action must be taken to prevent savers selling their fiat in times of crisis. The author of the paper, Ulrich Bindseil, said a potential solution could be to introduce a two-tier interest rate system that would offer “unattractive” rates to holdings above a certain threshold. Such measures are controversial in the crypto world, with Bitcoin proponents arguing that discouraging savers is a common failure of the fiat currency system.Boomers may be a constant source of derision online, but savvy millennials might want to remain tight-lipped. New research suggests that younger, Bitcoin-aware consumers could be set to inherit almost $70 trillion in value from this older generation by 2045 — that’s more than three times higher than the GDP of the U.S. This could pave the way for an influx of investment in BTC in the years to come. As the Twitter account Crypto Balkans noted, it might be time to retire the hashtag #OKBoomer and replace it with #ThanksBoomer.Champagne corks have been popping over at MetaMask — and not just because a new decade has arrived. Google has now reversed a short-lived ban on the browser add-on, meaning its app is available on the Google Play store once again. The extension, which includes a built-in crypto wallet, enables people to run Ethereum-based decentralized applications. Google claims the blacklisting was a mistake, and that it mistakenly thought that it was an app that mined crypto on mobile devices. Last week, it was revealed that Apple may force Coinbase to remove a DApp browser feature from its crypto wallet application. Critics have claimed that this “censorship” is set to continue because Web 3.0 “is in direct competition with Google and Apple.”At the end of the week, Bitcoin is at $7.493.23, Ether at $136.58 and XRP at $0.20. The total market cap is at $199,425,862,911.The top three altcoin gainers of the week are BlockStamp, SwissBorg and Aave. The top three altcoin losers of the week are EDUCare, LUNA and Centrality.For more info on crypto prices, make sure to read Cointelegraph’s market analysis.“I know our crypto community is not currently equally distributed and I would like to see more women join us to reach half of the community.

The CEO of the Bitcoin lending platform Nexo.io, Antoni Trenchev, has said he believes BTC will “very easily” balloon to $50,000 over the course of this year. He described it as an “incredible asset uncorrelated to the overall market” — and even claimed the cryptocurrency’s journey up to $20,000 was reminiscent of German hyperinflation after the First World War. Naturally, not everyone is on Trenchev’s wavelength. The CEO of the ZenGo wallet, Ouriel Ohayon, raised eyebrows when he “predicted” BTC would crash to below $1,000 this year. He later insisted he was joking — something that’s plausible given that his other predictions included that all hardware wallets will be hacked, XRP will become the most important cryptocurrency, and that Satoshi’s identity will be revealed.As a new decade begins, Bitmain is fighting battles on multiple fronts. Reports suggest the crypto mining giant is planning to reduce its workforce by another 50% before the next BTC halving event in May. The layoffs could be completed before mid-January. In other news, Bitmain’s co-founder Micree Zhan Ketuan has initiated court proceedings against company shareholders in a bid to restore his voting control of the firm. This comes after fellow co-founder Jihan Wu abruptly announced that Zhan had been dismissed from all his roles “effective immediately” and without his consent.Now, a cautionary tale about Chrome extensions. Claims emerged this week that an unsuspecting victim lost $16,000 after installing an add-on for Ledger crypto wallets that actually contained malware. The extension, called “Ledger Secure,” reportedly passes seed phrases back to the add-on’s author, and is not an official product. Ledger itself appears to have confirmed this in a tweet that warned its followers about a phishing alert.A French businessman has been indicted for allegedly stealing BTC worth 1 million euro from his former colleagues in a so-called “act of revenge.” The unnamed entrepreneur is accused of taking a total of 182 BTC — reportedly driven by a motivation to “wash away the humiliation” of being made redundant. It is claimed that he ensured each of his fraudulent BTC transfers was for an amount that wouldn’t trigger an internal security warning. This insider knowledge helped investigators realize that a current or former employee was responsible. The suspect is now subject to travel restrictions, and prosecutors are seeking him to be kept in custody until his trial.The Bitcoin frenzy in late 2017 may have died down, but mainstream media interest in cryptocurrencies has not.

Lee expects halving to act as a catalyst for the expected up move.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360While we agree that anything can happen in the crypto markets, we believe that Bitcoin will have to scale several stiff resistances before it reaches its lifetime highs. Until it breaks above the lifetime highs and goes into unchartered territory, it will not show the kind of momentum it did in 2017. Therefore, traders should be cautious and should take informed decisions without getting carried away by lofty targets. Let’s analyze the charts to locate the critical levels to watch out for.  Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below the support of the tight $9,200 to $9,600 range on Feb. 4. However, the bears could not build up on the breakdown. This shows that bulls continue to buy the dips. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in positive territory suggest that bulls are in command.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewToday, the buyers have carried the price close to the top of the range and then set a new 2020 high at $9,744. The breakout of this tight range is a positive sign and it suggests the BTC/USD pair can rally to $10,360.89, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.The short-term trend will weaken if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA at $8,982. Below this level, a drop to $8247.60 is possible. For now, we suggest traders retain the stop loss on the long positions at $8,200. If the price sustains above $9,600, the stops can be trailed higher to $8,900.Ether (ETH) is looking strong. The bulls purchased the minor dip on Feb. 4 and have today pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $197.75. If the bulls can sustain the price above this level, the altcoin is likely to pick up momentum.ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewAbove $197.75, the rally can extend to the next resistance at $223.999 and above it to $235.70. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are firmly in command. The traders can trail the stops on the remaining long positions to $180. If the bulls fail to sustain the price above $197.75, the ETH/USD pair will lose momentum. The pair will turn negative on a break below the strong support at $173.841.XRP has picked up momentum since bouncing off the 20-day EMA on Feb. 2. This shows that as price moves higher, the bears are throwing in their towel. The upsloping 20-day EMA and RSI in the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. XRP USD daily chart.

If the bulls can sustain above this level, a rally to $0.31503 will be on the cards.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the XRP/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $0.2326. The traders can trail the stops on the long positions to $0.23.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken out of the overhead resistance at $403.88 with a sharp rally today. This shows that the bulls have asserted their supremacy. There is a minor resistance at $440 above which, the up move can extend to $500.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe current breakout has negated the developing negative divergence on the RSI, which is another positive.Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to sustain the higher levels, the BCH/USD pair might again dip to the recent support at $360. A break below this support will turn the trend in favor of the bears.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has bounced off the support line of the symmetrical triangle. This shows that the bulls are defending this level aggressively. They will now attempt to carry the price above the resistance line of the triangle.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewIf successful, a move to $337.80 will be on the cards. Above this level, a retest of the lifetime highs at $458.70 is possible.Conversely, if the BSV/USD pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below the triangle, a drop to $236 is possible. We expect the buyers to defend this support aggressively.Litecoin (LTC) bounced off the breakout level of $66.1486 on Feb. 4, which is a positive sign. It shows that the bulls are defending this level aggressively. If the price can sustain above the minor resistance at $73.5259, a rally to $80.2731 is possible.LTC USD daily chart.

This shows that the bulls have overpowered the bears and the uptrend has resumed. The next level to watch on the upside is $4.8719. EOS USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWe expect the bears to defend the overhead resistance at $4.8719 aggressively. However, if the momentum carries the EOS/USD pair above this level, a move to $6 is possible.The only bearish setup on the chart is the negative divergence on the RSI. If the price turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance and plunges below $4, it will turn the tide in favor of the bears.The bulls are attempting to sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $19. If successful, Binance Coin (BNB) can rally to $21.80. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls are in command.BNB USD daily chart.

Therefore, traders can retain the stops on the long positions at $15.90. The stops can be trailed higher after the pair sustains above $19.Cardano (ADA) is attempting to resume the uptrend. If the price sustains above $0.586027, a move to $0.065229 is likely. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in overbought territory, the advantage is with the bulls.ADA USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe bears are likely to defend the overhead resistance at $0.065229 aggressively. However, if the bulls can propel the price above this level, a rally to $0.08 will be on the cards. For now, the traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long positions at breakeven.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the ADA/USD pair reverses direction and plummets below $0.052. Such a move will indicate a lack of buyers at higher levels.Tezos (XTZ) pulled back to the breakout level on Feb. 4, which was a buying opportunity for the traders, as suggested in our previous analysis. The altcoin has resumed its up move with a sharp rally today.XTZ USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe XTZ/USD pair can now move up to its target objective of $3.35. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash to the target. The pair might face resistance at $2.5 and above that at $2.90. Although the deeply overbought reading on the RSI indicates strong momentum, it also suggests that the rally has been too sharp in the short-term and a pullback or consolidation is possible. A break below $1.85 will invalidate our bullish view.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

investors inverse exposure to Bitcoin, called 21Shares Short Bitcoin.","Jan 23, 2020","Swiss cryptocurrency financial firm Amun AG launched an Exchange Traded Product (ETP) giving investors inverse exposure to Bitcoin (BTC), called 21Shares Short Bitcoin (SBTC).","As Cointelegraph Japan reported earlier today, Amun launched the derivative in question on Jan. 22 on Switzerland’s leading stock exchange, Six Swiss Exchange. The description of the product on the firm’s official website is as follows:“The 21Shares Short Bitcoin ETP (Ticker: SBTC) seeks to provide a -1x return to the performance of Bitcoin for a single day. This product obtains short exposure through borrowing Bitcoin and simultaneously selling it on an execution platform.”According to its official website, the Six Swiss Exchange has seen 1.94 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion) in operating income in 2018, 2.88 billion Swiss francs ($2.97 billion) of net profits in 2018 and has 2,594 employees. The exchange also claims to have a 70.8% market share of trading in the Swiss Leader Index. Six exchange also has 32.4 million financial instruments in its database.In a press release announcing the new product published earlier today, Amun’s CEO Hany Rashwan explained that the launch of this ETP is an important addition to its derivatives. He claimed:“We have worked hard to be in a position to launch the first inverse Bitcoin ETP on a regulated trading venue here in Switzerland. Amun offers an existing suite of long investment products for a variety of crypto assets, however, the one missing puzzle was to deliver a product to capitalize on negative price movements.”This ETP is one in a long series of fully collateralized and custodied crypto-based financial derivatives launched by Amun. Earlier, the company also launched the Amun Crypto Basket Index ETP, Amun Bitcoin, Amun Ethereum, Amun XRP, AMUN Bitcoin Cash ETP, Amun Binance ETP, Amun Tezos ETP, Amun Bitcoin Suisse ETP, Amun Bitwise 10 ETP and Amun Sygnum Platform Winners Index ETP.An Amun spokesperson told Cointelegraph that — depending on SBTC’s success — the firm may launch more crypto shorting ETPs as well as other products such as leveraged derivatives. The firm’s CEO Hany Rashwan told Cointelegraph that Amun’s products are regulated and claimed that they are easy to use. Then, he also shared his perspective on current products lacking in the crypto derivative landscape:“Crypto is transforming into an asset class and the demand for derivatives like leverage and inverses is both massive and growing rapidly. Yet, the products that exist today in the form of options/futures are built mostly out of unregulated geographies which dispels institutional investors or are too complicated and require a lot of management which is too complicated for retail investors.”In December 2019, Amin also got approval to offer its products to retail clients in the European Union, effectively opening access to crypto exposure to a broader demographic.Many companies launch cryptocurrency derivatives as the investors show an increasing demand for such products.In early December, Bitcoin futures open interest on digital asset platform Bakkt hit a new all-time high. Earlier this month, cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX launched Bitcoin and reportedly hit $1 million two hours after launch."

After what he described as a “bonded courier” delivered evidence in the multimillion-dollar legal battle to confirm his identity, Wright’s lawyer subsequently confirmed it contained no private key information at all.“The file that he’s received did not include private keys,” Andres Rivero told cryptocurrency news outlet Decrypt on Jan. 18.Bitcoin SV 7-day price chart.

Thai police have reportedly identified the actor as a person of interest pending further investigation.The captors have allegedly tortured Cheng and requested a ransom of 1 million Singapore dollars ($740,000) in Bitcoin (BTC). The businessman was only able to provide the equivalent of just over $46,000 to the captors, who then seemingly decided to execute him. Cheng was able to escape his alleged fate, recounting to Wanbao: ”One of them held the gun against the back of my head while the others stepped away. Fortunately, I know martial arts. I reached behind my head and grabbed the pistol, and then I fled.”Thai police later identified his associate Kim as the mastermind of the kidnapping and charged him with multiple felonies, to which he confessed. The money appears to have been since returned, according to some sources.Mark Cheng appears to have begun his business career with Avelife, a non-profit socio-environmental organization. In 2016, he received a Queen’s Young Leaders Award from Queen Elizabeth II for his work.Since then, he took an interest in the world of cryptocurrencies, appearing in 2018 as an advisor to X Infinity, a Singaporean initial coin offering project that has shown no signs of life since April 2019. A meetup related to the project describes him as a partner at Gladiolus Capital and advisor to Start-Up Brunei.Multiple sources including Wanbao and The New Paper report that Cheng was being prosecuted for misappropriating funds from an investment group he was working at in 2014. He was released on bail for a reported amount of 120,000 Singapore dollars ($89,000) on Jan. 8, arriving in Thailand the next morning.Court documents partially revealed to Cointelegraph seem to confirm this. Cheng is accused to have knowingly worked in an investment fund lacking the appropriate licenses, Zabel Global Investments Ltd., and allegedly embezzling the equivalent of over $220,000.This is not the first time that businessmen involved with crypto have been targeted by kidnappers. In 2017, a Bitcoin trader was kidnapped in India by another BTC investor. In the same year, the director of cryptocurrency exchange EXMO was kidnapped in Ukraine, with the captors reportedly extracting a $1 million ransom."

Bitcoin Market — the first cryptocurrency exchange — opened its doors in ...","Jan 19, 2020","As Bitcoin enters its twelfth year, the past eleven offer a meaningful amount of time to identify key trends that have emerged around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. These trends provide insights that are helpful in projecting the future of the digital asset space and how it will take shape over the next decade.","In reflecting on the history of cryptocurrencies over their lifetime, there’s one pattern that immediately jumps out. Each successive wave of interest in the cryptocurrency space has been galvanized by new developments in the ecosystem. In particular, two significant catalysts were the rise of crypto exchanges and the initial coin offerings craze.These days, crypto users are spoilt for choice when it comes to exchanges, so it’s easy to overlook the seismic impact that these platforms had when they first emerged. Although Bitcoin launched in January 2009, it was over a year before Bitcoin Market — the first cryptocurrency exchange — opened its doors in February 2010. Other exchanges swiftly followed, including the now infamous Mt.Gox. It took less than eleven months from the opening of Bitcoin Market for Bitcoin to achieve parity with the United States dollar.Fast-forward to 2016, Ethereum unleashed its ERC-20 token standard to the world, which quickly evolved into the 2017/2018 ICO boom. Whether people loved it or loathed it, the ICO craze was probably the biggest moment in the industry’s history. Once tech entrepreneurs became aware of how easy it is to create their own token, the blockchain scene — and the price of Bitcoin — exploded.Related: ERC-20 Tokens, ExplainedEven before Bitcoin hit its peak price of $20,000 in December 2017, there was talk of the ICO bubble bursting. In a nascent sector where so many companies claim to offer a unique value proposition that is often a carbon-copy of its peers, it’s inevitable that many of them would eventually fizzle out.However, the crypto sector is unusual in that the value of the underlying technology is often perceived in line with market capitalization. Once the crypto winter hit, it hit hard. Once the crypto winter hit, it hit hard. As the prices remained low from the beginning of 2018 all the way until the spring of 2019, the perceived value of blockchain also went down, along with the value of the vast majority of tokens that had been issued during the boom. One study reported that less than half of the projects were still active a mere five months after their token sales.Since the 2018 crash, it’s become increasingly evident that hype alone cannot sustain the industry. The vast majority of firms that promised to “revolutionize” existing industries through the introduction of a token have failed, leading to criticisms that blockchain is “a solution in search of a problem.”Despite the critics, Bitcoin and many altcoins have survived well. But what’s clear is that many of the initiatives that survived the crypto winter did so by keeping their promise and offering a real-world use case. There are several examples that illustrate this point well.Related: What’s Next for the Industry as ‘Crypto Winter’ Thaws?Supply chain was one sector where blockchain appeared to have a lot to offer, promising transparent proof of provenance from factory to end consumer. In mid-2019, Gartner reported that over 90% of blockchain-based supply chain projects were failing. This is allegedly because the technology was failing to live up to the hype.However, there are several notable examples of multinational firms using blockchain in supply chain and logistics, indicating that the tech’s use case does indeed hold value. Maersk implemented its TradeLens blockchain solution in 2018, which now boasts 90 partners and was adopted by the Thai customs agency in August last year. Coca-Cola is another case in point, having expanded its pilot solution from two to 70 partners late last year.Gaming is another example of a use case where blockchain is adding real value. In-game assets are big business, with the virtual goods market worth over $50 billion. However, without blockchain, the assets themselves have no underlying value and are under the control of the game developers and publishers. Non-fungible tokens may well be set to transform the gaming sector, enabling users to take full ownership of one-of-a-kind assets, as pioneered by games like CryptoKitties.There are other applications in the gaming sector. Royalty payments have been an ongoing challenge, with Microsoft Xbox developers working to resolve payment delays of up to 45 days due to difficulties in manual calculations and distribution. The company partnered with Ernst & Young to develop an automated, blockchain-based solution for its royalty payments, creating a more efficient, streamlined process.Related: Gaming Is Key to the Mass Adoption of CryptoEver since the 2008 financial crisis, it’s been virtually impossible to earn decent returns from good, old-fashioned savings accounts. Now, interest-earning accounts for cryptocurrency are opening up new avenues of passive income that doesn’t involve pure speculation on the volatile crypto markets or an active investment strategy.One of the most popular ways is lending, allowing holders to deposit their funds on a loan platform so other users can take a loan, providing interest to the lender. However, staking offers another way of generating returns, where proof-of-stake blockchains distribute the equivalent of mining rewards to network participants.Regardless of which lending solution crypto holders opt for, the returns are generally far higher than one would get from placing funds into a traditional bank savings account. Of course, the risks may also be more significant, depending on the type of investment and the chosen platform.The original use case of Bitcoin was as a store of value, and it remains one of the biggest growth drivers today. Over recent years and throughout the crypto winter, citizens in countries including Venezuela, Argentina and Iran have turned to Bitcoin as a means of protecting their wealth from the effects of hyperinflation. Global or political events may also have an impact on the appeal of cryptocurrencies as a store of value.Related: Global Economic Crises Show Idea of BTC as Store of Value Catching OnThe real-world use case of blockchain as a reprise from hyperinflation demonstrates the bridge being established between the emerging technology and a current economic problem.Related: Is Bitcoin a Store of Value? Experts on BTC as Digital GoldDespite the progress, there is still plenty of room for improvement. In particular, the barrier to entry for new users remains a major issue for the cryptocurrency space. Even now in 2020, owning digital currency often still means navigating unfamiliar technologies and platforms. This can be off-putting to the less technologically capable users, however, organizations such as Skrill are working to eliminate the barriers to entering the crypto space.Reputation is a separate challenge. In 2019 alone, there were 12 high-profile attacks on exchanges. Scams are also still all too common. It’s an unfortunate reality that the biggest stories about crypto tend to be scandalous, and therefore make headlines in the mainstream media. For example, the BBC’s Missing Cryptoqueen podcast, covering the disappearance of OneCoin’s Dr. Ruja Ignatova, was a major viral hit.The reality is that for many people uninitiated to cryptocurrency, stories like this will probably form the basis of their perceptions.None of this is to detract from the efforts of key players in the industry to establish a more reliable reputation for cryptocurrency. Coinbase has always worked hard to hold itself up as an example of how exchanges can operate in compliance with regulators. It was the second company to win the coveted New York Bitlicense, followed by others such as Xapo and Bitstamp. In the United Kingdom, Kraken Futures operates under the supervision of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority.However, the entry of existing reputable payment firms and banks into the crypto space is critical to increasing adoption among new crypto users. This serves several purposes.Firstly, their entry creates a concrete link between the existing financial world and the new world of digital assets. As outlined above, creating a real-world bridge between any particular industry and blockchain is a proven recipe for success in the space of emerging technologies. Furthermore, reducing the barriers to entry for new users is critical if crypto is to attain widespread adoption.A less tangible benefit — but one that is no less important — is to further bolster the reputability of cryptocurrencies among the uninitiated. This reputational problem can be solved by creating a bridge between established, trusted financial services and cryptocurrencies.The eleven years since Bitcoin’s launch have been a rollercoaster ride for anyone involved in the space. But during that time, the token has grown from its cypherpunk roots to becoming a credible investment vehicle. Meanwhile, the potential of the underlying technology has only just started to make its mark on industry and the economy. Further removing the barriers to entry will go a long way toward allowing cryptocurrencies to settle into their niche among the existing financial infrastructure. Once that happens, widespread adoption should soon follow. The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Lorenzo Pellegrino is the CEO of Skrill, Neteller and Income Access, at Paysafe Group.

users and to prepare for the mainnet's launch. 4062 Total views.","Jan 13, 2020","The team behind the Digitex Futures exchange reports that the launch of its trading platform’s beta version has been successful. Now, the company is working on further developments, taking into account user feedback in order to prepare for the launch of the mainnet.","Digitex reports it is going to incentivize the testers of its public beta version by launching the Digitex Daily Trading Battle on Friday Jan. 17. Users will not only be able to compete for prizes but can also familiarize themselves with the platform and try out all kinds of daring trading strategies without worrying about losing actual funds.The company says it wants its exchange to produce more winning traders. That’s why it is organizing trading competitions to give users the chance to improve their scalp trading skills on the testnet. The beta version of the platform will be available after the launch of the mainnet as well. As a result, beginners will still be able to use the testnet as a learning environment, and advanced traders will get a tool for sharpening their skills and trying out new trading techniques.According to Digitex, the competition will last 100 days and produce 100 winners each day. Traders will also have the chance to win prizes through referrals. For this, users should share referral links on their social channels with their friends — and if any of them end up being one of the 100 daily winners, whoever sent them the referral will get the same prize. Not only will this competition serve as a stress-test for the platform and to battle-harden traders in preparation for the mainnet, but it will also bring greater attention to the exchange and help the company onboard new users. The CEO and founder of Digitex Futures, Adam Todd, explains: “The Digitex Trading Battle is a series of ongoing battles preparing our traders for real live trading with actual DGTX. We aim to grow our numbers, popularize scalping, and create a highly liquid BTC futures market by mainnet launch.”The team states that Digitex allows traders to place buy and sell orders over and over again without having to pay any fees at any moment. Beyond removing the commissions from trading Bitcoin futures, the Digitex project has become well known for its trading interface, the team adds. Users can stay in the zone and watch the price movement go up and down on both sides of the ladder.New features are being constantly added to the platform, “making it more user-friendly and convenient” for different types of traders. For instance, the recent launch of the depth chart — a position-lines feature — allows users to immediately see both their entry price and liquidation price.According to the company’s earlier reports, after the mainnet launch, it is going to offer its users a wide range of crypto futures contracts, including Litecoin (LTC) and Ether (ETH). It will also consider adding traditional futures markets — including forex, metals, commodities and indexes. Thereby, the company is striving to attract traditional retail futures traders who are interested in commission-free trading.Disclaimer.

Total ...","Jan 17, 2020",Lawmakers in the New Hampshire state legislature have killed a bill that would have allowed state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies as payment for taxes. ,"On Jan. 8, the New Hampshire House of Representatives announced a decision to retract the bill, following a motion from the General Court’s Executive Departments and Administration Committee to deem the initiative as “inexpedient to legislate.”According to public records, authorities considered the bill ineffective due to the high volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). If the bill was adopted, expenditures of the Department of Revenue Administration (DRA) would have surged by an “indeterminable amount” in the fiscal year of 2020, the document reads:“These changes would increase DRA expenditures by an indeterminable amount in FY 2020, in anticipation of an implementation date of July 1, 2020.  DRA cannot estimate if any additional revenue would be generated due to the acceptance of cryptocurrencies. The volatility of accepting cryptocurrencies could affect revenues due to tax assessments being generated in U.S. currency.”Introduced in January 2019, the bill NH HB470 would have legalized tax payments in crypto starting from July 1, 2020. The bill was sponsored by Republicans Dennis Acton and Michael Yakubovich and originated from a similar bill that was first initiated in the state back in 2015. The older bill, HR552, was voted down 13–4 as “inexpedient to legislate” at the end of that year.In November 2018, the state of Ohio was reported to become the first state to accept crypto for tax payments, initially allowing the option exclusively to businesses in the state. However, Ohio Treasurer Robert Sprague subsequently suspended the service in October 2019, claiming that the state needs to make sure that such initiatives were established in accordance with Ohio law.Indeed, bills that would allow crypto holders to use Bitcoin to pay their taxes have seen little traction in state legislatures in the United States. In 2018, similar crypto tax-friendly bills introduced by Arizona, Illinois and Georgia ended up dead in committee, adjourned indefinitely, or vetoed by the governor, respectively. "

However, as open interest increases, the market also becomes vulnerable to long liquidation if the price turns down sharply. Let’s study the charts to find out whether they indicate a move higher or a correction from the current levels.Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading inside the $9,200 to $9,600 range for the past few days. This shows that the bulls and the bears are playing it safe and are avoiding large directional bets. If the bears sink the price below the range, a drop to the 20-day EMA at $8,897 is possible. We expect the bulls to defend the 20-day EMA aggressively. A bounce off this support will indicate demand on dips and will increase the possibility of a rally above $9,600.BTC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWith both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the positive zone, the advantage is with the bulls. If the buyers can push the price above $9,600 and sustain it, a move to $10,360.89 is possible. Nonetheless, if the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 50-day SMA at $8,058 is likely. For now, the stops on the long positions can be kept at $8,200. The short-term traders can book partial profits if the price sustains below the 20-day EMA.Ether (ETH) bounced off the support at $173.841 on Jan. 31 and reached close to the overhead resistance at $197.75 on Feb. 3.

With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI close to the overbought zone, the advantage is clearly with the bulls. On a break above $197.75, the next target to watch out for is $223.999. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and dips below the 20-day EMA at $171.46.

If the bears sink the price below the support at $360 and the 20-day EMA at $347, the pair will turn negative and can plummet to $306.78. Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been bouncing off the support line of the symmetrical triangle for the past three days. However, the bulls have not been able to build upon the rebound, which suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.BSV USD daily chart.

For almost 2 years there has been a ‘ban’ on cryptocurrency trading since the Reserve Bank of India issued a notice to Indian banks to stop dealing with any cryptocurrency businesses. However, peer to peer trading continues on and India once again has solidified itself as a blockchain leader.It seems India has had a volatile past with blockchain but has corrected course and is trending in the right direction.Besides beautiful archeological sites and magnificent natural wonders India is known for their high levels of tech savvy. Some of the world’s best engineers and developers are based out of India. Blockchain requires this level of technological ingenuity.Where better to discuss technology, cryptocurrency, blockchain, bitcoin and India’s developments than at a conference in India?The 1st major blockchain conference being brought together by many of India’s top crypto startups is taking place January 25th and 26th. Genesis Block 2020 is taking place in Bangalore, India, and is hosting many of the top speakers in the space.Matic (Title Sponsor), WazirX, Delta Exchange and many others are joining forces to pull off India’s 1st major blockchain event part of the #IndiaWantsCrypto campaign. Over a year ago, Nischal Shetty, the founder of WazirX (recently acquired by Binance) started this campaign to shed light on India’s desire to enter the blockchain space.India has the 2nd largest pool of developers in the world and with major institutions like Binance noticing, it is not surprising to see major conferences beginning to pop up across India. Starting with Genesis Block 2020.This January celebrated the 11th birthday of the Genesis Block and to commemorate this event India is playing host to a major blockchain conference. The conference has a secondary focus, beyond celebrating BTC’s birthday: spreading knowledge.Genesis Block 2020 is well aware that there is significant misinformation in the cryptocurrency space. With their highly selective list of speakers and informational seminars they look to provide proper information regarding many topics. From leaders of Indian blockchain projects to U.S. based ‘influencers’, this conference has it all.Addressing the immense amount of misinformation in the space is a primary goal of Genesis Block and should be a primary goal of all blockchain conferences. Many conferences solely focus on sponsors and pushing their agenda. Genesis Block 2020 is different, they are here to celebrate BTC, welcome blockchain to India, and inform the public who may be misinformed.Having the 2nd largest population in the world of individuals and developers makes India a likely focal point for blockchain development in the coming years. It seems Genesis Block 2020 understands this and has gathered the top Indian blockchain companies together to provide information to the public while hosting one of India’s 1st major blockchain events.Matic, Blockstack, Telos, Inblox.

Others, such as Lumen (XLM), lost more than half their price value and tumbled from the pedestal of crypto glory. DogeCoin (DOGE) demonstrated the lowest volatility, which is entering 2020 at the same price as 12 months ago.Year-to-date: +87%The biggest move: +282% over six monthsThe king of cryptocurrencies dominated the price charts throughout 2019, gaining 282% in value over just half a year, and with its biggest 24-hour loss constituting a 10% drop on July 11.

The hike in price was accompanied by the combined and consequent growth of other cryptocurrencies trailing Bitcoin’s lead. However, the same cannot be said about the second half of the year, as the BTC market consistently experienced bearish moods.Year-to-date: -12%The biggest move: +139% over six monthsThe number two cryptocurrency had a rather interesting year, finishing it up in the green after adding 139% over the first half of the year. However, the second half of 2019 was marked by its worst drop of 36% over a 10-day period in July.2019 was quite a busy year for ETH, which tripled in value in the first half of the year. On June 26, the exchange rate reached its peak with a 139% spike over a six-month stretch, showering the battered crypto community with much-needed optimism.2019 proved to be quite a lucrative year for some participants of the crypto market. The biggest growth was exhibited by assets such as Luna Coin, Chainlink and Matic.Year-to-date: +25,000%The biggest move: +48,900% over a dayThe LUNA charts look like the cardiogram of a patient who woke up from a coma. After eight months of hibernation, the coin surged sharply by 48,900% on Aug. 19, setting the absolute record for daily growth. However, the flight was short-lived, with LUNA collapsing a day later to its previous performance levels.Nevertheless, by the end of the year, the coin managed to regain its position and now is on the list of the most profitable assets, showing a year-to-date growth of 25,000%. Since the beginning of the year, the price of the token has increased from $0.001 to $0.25.Year-to-date: -99%The biggest move: +3,500% over a weekB2G, a fork of Bitcoin, has made the list of 2019’s biggest gainers with a 3,500% return over the course of a week. The coin multiplied its price in early February, surging from $0.02 to $0.70. However, since July 2019, the project has been demonstrating almost no activity and trading volumes of between $0.50 and $5.Year-to-date: +2,640%The biggest move: +2,640% over a yearEthereum-based token Seele made the list of 2019’s biggest gainers, with year-to-date twenty-sevenfold price growth, having entered 2019 with a price of $0.005. At the moment, Seele is valued at $0.137 per coin, which has made its investors profitable despite the cryptocurrency market’s recent overall bearish mood.Year-to-date: -98%The biggest move: +1,100% over 2 daysOn Dec. 23, the little-known Ethereum Meta token made headlines, having risen in price from $0.000001 by 1,100% in just 48 hours. Notably, the daily trading volume of the coin was only $87 at that moment. After continuing its flight to the moon on Dec. 25, ETHM dropped by 97%. Since the beginning of 2020, ETHM has been experiencing some great volatility.ETHM has seen possible two pump and dumps since the start of the year. Source: Coin360.comThe project founders did not make any statements regarding the price fluctuations, and its social network accounts have been inactive for two months. This may indicate that the coin was intentionally pumped and dumped.Year-to-date: +285%The biggest move: +1,233% over a monthAs Matic aimed to attract developers by offering them a way to deploy and run decentralized applications securely, its token price surged by 1,233% over the course of May. However, a 52% price drop over a period of one week ensued during that same month.In late April, Matic was listed by exchanges with its initial trading price of $0.003, but its value reached a peak price of $0.04 on May 21, rising tenfold over the course of a month. In mid-November, the coin’s price started growing rapidly, setting its an all-time high of $0.042 on Dec. 8. However, this increase was razed in just a few hours, when the price of the asset fell by 70% and returned to the levels it had grazed on two weeks prior.While market leaders such as Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao were defending the project, Matic’s operations director, Sandeep Nialwal, called the depreciation of the asset the result of “obvious manipulation” and promised to provide a detailed analysis of what had happened.Despite the downturns, the altcoin is currently almost four times more expensive than it was during its initial exchange offering. Early investors are still in positive territory, even despite a threefold drop in the price of the coin in mid-December.Year-to-date: +459%The biggest move: +1,186% over six monthsA regular member of Cointelegraph’s “Top crypto this week” section, LINK boosted 1,186% in value on June 29 and gained 459% over the year.Many high-profile partnerships with large companies such as Google, Binance, Oracle and Aelf allowed the coin to surge by 10 times in value in the first half of 2019. On June 29, LINK broke a historic record, growing 1,186% soon after Coinbase Pro announced its plans to list the token. The overall price growth over the course of the year was recorded at 459%.Year-to-date: +122%The biggest move: +548% over six monthsBNB is a utility token for discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange. Given the platform’s popularity, the coin gained 548% in value over the course of the first half of the year and all-in-all grew by 122% in 2019.Since December of last year, the price of the coin has grown to $38.48, up 548%. At the same time, BNB remains one of the few cryptocurrencies whose investors are still in positive territory. Over the year, the coin added 122% in value, and there are several reasons for this.One of them was the launch of the Binance DEX, which held several successful IEOs, as well as the evolution of BNB as an ecosystem.The rapid growth was also supported by a well-built economic model deployed around the BNB coin, which allows its owners to take advantage of reduced exchange commissions.Year-to-date: -85%The biggest move: +214% over two weeksThe Celer network was another IEO held on the Binance Launchpad. Although it managed to add 214% in price in just two weeks in May, early investors still suffered losses. Initially, the coin was sold at $0.007. At its peak, its value reached $0.03. But, by the end of the year, the asset was valued at $0.0038, losing almost half its price since the crowdsale.2019 saw its fair share of price drops, and the biggest investor disappointers has been compiled into the list below.Year-to-date: -99%The biggest move: -97% over a dayBTT, which demonstrated an eightfold increase last year, broke another record in May 2019 — this time hitting the lists of losers. On May 1, its price dropped from $0.02 to $0.0006 in just one day and has been steadily decreasing ever since.Nevertheless, Tron's BitTorrent is currently one of the most successful IEO projects. Despite an impressive drop from its highs in the second half of the year, the coin is still trading at prices twice the amount it was during the crowdsale, when it was sold for $0.00012.Year-to-date: -84%The biggest move: -87% over six monthsThe FXT token is another unfortunate leader with its price drop, losing 87% over the course of half a year.

While still continuing to fall, XRP set a record for the number of transactions in early December.

Total views. 78 ...","Jan 14, 2020","For one week, the Iran–United States military crisis gripped the crypto community. It began on Jan. 3 with a U.S. drone strike on a convoy traveling near Baghdad International Airport, killing Iranian major general Qasem Soleimani of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The price of Bitcoin (BTC) soared.","As reported by Cointelegraph at the time, there is strong evidence to suggest that BTC’s price surge from $7,000 to nearly $8,500 is strongly linked to the tensions between the two nations. For example, the push toward $8,500 took place at the same time as mainstream media began to report on a retaliatory attack by Iran on the American forces based in Iraq.According to data from Google Trends, the search term “Bitcoin Iran” surged 4,450% in the seven days to Jan. 8, Cointelegraph disclosed. The crisis spurred a surge in cryptocurrencies, the Nikkei Asian Review proclaimed, as “migrant workers and investors turn to ‘digital gold’ as financial conduit and safe haven.”Nigel Green, CEO of the United Kingdom’s deVere Group, said on the matter: “This latest Bitcoin price increase underscores a mounting consensus that Bitcoin is becoming a flight-to-safety asset.”Related: Bitcoin Is Becoming More Valuable to Iranians Amid Tensions With USAfter U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Jan. 8 that he would seek no further military action against Iran following its U.S. air base bombings, the crisis was effectively over. At that point, it seemed that the BTC price retreated to the $8,000 mark, as reported by Cointelegraph. All is quiet on the Iranian front, for now. That said, the crisis arguably inspired some new respect for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — and also raised some questions.“With an escalation in geopolitical turbulence, which typically unsettles traditional markets, it can be expected that a growing number of investors will decide to increase their exposure to decentralized, non-sovereign, secure currencies, such as Bitcoin,” commented Green. This new hedging group will include retail and institutional investors.One might, indeed, see heightened demand for Bitcoin after the past week of tensions in the Middle East “as investors in the region may look to move funds away from traditional investments such as gold or global bonds,” Edward Moya, Senior Market Analyst at OANDA, told Cointelegraph. He added:“Bitcoin may have seen a bottom put in place, and some investors may feel more confident that Bitcoin can reach $10,000 a lot easier than gold can return to its 2011 record highs just above the $1,900 level.”    Opinion isn’t uniform, however. Sima Baktas, founder of GlobalB Law told Cointelegraph that global tensions will play a big role in the short term, adding that: “It's important to remember that if Bitcoin becomes too popular a commodity in a country where the capital outflow is bringing down the local currency [e.g., Iran, Turkey] , it could become a victim of its own success and see the government step in to clamp down on investment.”Green’s assessment on Bitcoin becoming a flight-to-safety asset has some qualified support, but not all agree completely. Moya believes that it may take some time before the assets may be counted as equals:“Bitcoin at times has rallied alongside other well known safe-havens [e.g., gold, the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen], but it is far from becoming a more traditional flight-to-safety trade. Bitcoin lost most of its safe-haven trade allure after regulatory concerns grew in both China and the U.S. in the last half of the past year.”“For many Iranian traders, there is more hope in the consistently volatile nature of Bitcoin than in the consistently inflationary nature of the Iranian Rial,” GlobalB Law’s Max Lurya told Cointelegaph, adding: “That’s not to say that Bitcoin is perceived as a flight-to-safety asset, as Bitcoin is not considered a low-risk investment relative to gold or silver.”This isn’t the first time BTC price has surged during geopolitical tensions recently. “In August, it jumped as global stocks were rocked by the devaluation of China’s yuan during the trade war with the U.S.,” noted Green.When Cointelegraph asked Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, if his view of Bitcoin had changed significantly as a result of the Iran–U.S. crisis, he answered: “Yes, it has. It was quite profound to see Bitcoin acting as a clear safe haven in the face of a global risk event.”  “Bitcoin jumped 5 per cent as news of the strikes broke around the world on Friday,” observed Green. “Simultaneously, the price of gold — known as the ultimate safe-haven asset — also moved higher.” Bitcoin is living up to its reputation as “digital gold,” Green continued: It is a store of value like gold and is perceived as being resistant to inflation like gold, and, as a result, “it could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitalized.” Again, Green’s sweeping view was endorsed only up to a point by others in the crypto community. Greenspan, for instance, wrote in a Jan. 6 newsletter, “The resemblance between digital gold and the physical stuff [BTC-GLD] is uncanny. They've basically been moving in a very similar pattern throughout most of last year.”This is a departure, noted Greenspan, because, until recently, Bitcoin has been seen mostly as an uncorrelated asset that does not react directly to what's happening in other markets. As reported by Cointelegraph, during the crisis, the price of oil also surged by 4% to just under $72 per barrel, while Dow Jones, S&P500 and Nasdaq saw slight pullbacks. That said, it may be premature to call BTC the new gold. Greenspan told Cointelegraph: “Gold has been a backbone of the global economy for thousands of years and is a much more reliable safety asset. Bitcoin is only a decade old and still presents all kinds of existential risks. The hope is that it eventually becomes the new backbone of the digital economy, but it’s too early to make such a claim now.”As has been widely reported, economically troubled Venezuela is a hotbed of crypto activity. As recently as December, Venezuela and Argentina set new peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading volume records, as citizens reportedly attempted to mitigate the inflation risks. However, one must be careful about generalizing from one country’s experience as Lurya told Cointelegraph: “During the most recent anti-government protests, Iran experienced a complete internet shutdown. Some Iranian traders resorted to international travel in order to close their positions; others logged back into their accounts several days later only to find their positions liquidated; the crackdown will most likely serve as a major deterrent against speculative trading.” Related: Five Countries Where Crypto Regulation Changed the Most in 2019Blockchain adoption and cryptocurrency adoption are far from being one and the same, and there are plenty of countries with governments hostile toward cryptocurrency that are more than eager to adopt blockchain technology. Baktas added: “For Iranian investors, Bitcoin is the embodiment of financial independence for an economy that has been teetering on the brink of collapse.” Iranians cannot invest openly on the NASDAQ or the London Stock Exchange, and investors have relatively few investment opportunities. Bitcoin has the attraction, too, of being a currency “that cannot be taken away--either by the Iranian government or foreign actors. It seems to me they’re just getting started.”Before declaring crypto as a leading flight-to-safety option like gold, however, it might be wise to reflect again upon what actually happened in Iran when tensions rose in the past year. The authorities simply shut down the internet, meaning traders couldn’t easily apply their skills.Programmers compensated for work abroad in BTC didn’t get paid, according to some reports. As Lurya told Cointelegraph, “It appears a decent internet connection is crypto’s newest Achilles heel,” adding:“I cannot imagine cryptocurrency being more appealing than traditional flight-to-safety assets to anyone at the onset of conflict. If Iran were to experience further political unrest, I would expect Iranian margin traders to rush to abandon their positions in preparation for the likely event of another shutdown.”Still, it seems clear that those who viewed crypto as a totally uncorrelated asset pre-crisis may have to reassess, given that the price of Bitcoin and other cryptos seemed to rise as world tensions ratcheted up, and subside along with the turmoil — much like gold and silver."

Therefore, we suggest traders book profits on intraday rallies on about 75% of the remaining position and keep a small position open with a trailing stop loss that can be a little deep.Litecoin (LTC) has reached the first target objective of $60 where it is facing some resistance.

Recently, Bitcoin (BTC) price reached a 2-month record high crossing above the $9,000 mark as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC) reaching $62.80 which is the highest price seen since mid-November 2018.","Cryptocurrency market weekly overview. Source: Coin360Cryptocurrencies’ volatile behavior is one of the main concerns raised by researchers and it complicates the argument that Bitcoin should be classified as a traditional investment asset and that it is a reliable store of value.Amid those discussions, Bitcoin has been closely compared to gold, while Litecoin has been associated with being “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold.”As reported by Cointelegraph, new data suggests that the actual correlation between Bitcoin and gold is not significant, as well as gold’s explanatory power of Bitcoin returns. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is still frequently compared to gold, particularly as a potential safe-haven asset.Since October 2019, silver prices have approached new record-highs. But does the latest data support the argument that Litecoin is the silver of cryptocurrencies? Could Bitcoin instead of Litecoin be closer to silver than to gold?Silver prices since October 2019. Source: BullionVaultOur data — from May 2013 until December 2019 — shows that Bitcoin and Litecoin returns are very positively correlated (0.67) with 1 implying a strong positive correlation and 0 meaning that the assets are not correlated. A reading of -1 shows that the assets are completely inversely correlated.Meanwhile, the correlation between silver and Litecoin returns is close to zero (0.026), which is similar to Bitcoin’s correlation with silver (0.0025).We further analyzed the correlation between the lagged silver returns and the two assets. In other words, the correlation between yesterday’s silver returns and today’s Litecoin and Bitcoin returns were compared.However, the results are even more discouraging, since both show negative correlations with the lagged silver returns. Bitcoin’s correlation was -0.03 while Litecoin’s was -0.05.April 2013-December 2019 correlation between silver, Bitcoin and Litecoin returns and silver’s lagged returnsAnalyzing the rolling correlations provides a wider view and each data point in the diagram above refers to the correlation of silver and Bitcoin returns (BTC/silver), and between silver and Litecoin returns (LTC/silver) over the last 30 days.One can see that the correlation between Bitcoin and silver, and Litecoin and silver, is very similar across time during both negative and positive periods.Rolling correlations between Bitcoin/silver, and Litecoin/silver from May 2013-December 2019Hence, both Bitcoin and Litecoin have a small correlation and similar relationship with silver. Thus, the Litecoin as “digital silver” narrative is challenged by these very low correlation values. Moreover, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin has surpassed both Litecoin and silver as the best investment option over the past ten years.Cumulative Bitcoin, Litecoin and silver returns from investments made between May 2013 and January 2020For investors, a closer look at these relationships over the short-term can help draw better insights for future investment strategies. In 2018, the correlation between silver for both assets is slightly higher than the first results from May 2013 to December 2019, albeit still very low. Bitcoin is correlated at 0.05 with silver and Litecoin is correlated at 0.09.Whereas in 2019, Bitcoin and Litecoin had opposite correlations to silver with Bitcoin and silver correlation being 0.03 and the Litecoin and silver correlation being negative at -0.02. Even the correlation between Bitcoin and Litecoin returns is lower than in other samples (0.74).Nonetheless, both results are very close to 0, which leads us to believe that the correlation between these assets is not representative enough to draw reliable strategies for investors.Correlation in 2019 between Silver returns, BTC returns, and Litecoin returns The data, however, suggests that silver returns may work as a predictor for future Litecoin returns. From the model employed, if silver’s return rose by 1% yesterday, we can expect that Litecoin returns may decrease by -0.232% today. This statistically significant result can lead investors to assume that silver returns may work as a predictor for future Litecoin returns in a negative way. Similar outcomes were not found in the case of Bitcoin, however.The ability to predict prices has been the holy grail of financial markets, hence the importance of this relationship between returns. Even though both crypto assets show a very low correlation with silver, the results for the lagged returns shed some light on the relationship between silver and future Litecoin returns.Looking forward, investors may want to look at silver returns to draw strategies when buying/selling Litecoin based on this past silver return’s analysis. However, any strategy has to consider the fast-changing crypto market environment and careful analysis over different time periods, which can cause different conclusions.Nevertheless, these findings can help us to conclude that Litecoin as the digital equivalent of silver is far-fetched due to the low correlations. However, we do highlight the value of investigating the digital silver narrative by establishing a new connection between returns, which is crucial for investors.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

CME’s market entrance came just one week after the Chicago Board Options Exchange, or CBOE, launched a similar cash-settled Bitcoin futures trading product. “Our Bitcoin futures have evolved over the last two years and are now one of the most liquid, listed bitcoin derivatives available globally,” McCourt said. In contrast, CBOE discontinued its Bitcoin futures trading product in March 2019, after a lengthy bear market consumed the prior year. Despite losing institutional crypto participation from the CBOE, the crypto industry has since gained other mainstream involvement. The Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, launched physically-settled Bitcoin futures trading through its Bakkt platform on Sept. 23, 2019. Bakkt also opened Bitcoin options trading on its cash-settled Bitcoin futures in December 2019.  The market is apparently very interested in CME’s Bitcoin futures, evident in this new massive volume benchmark. “We continue to see strong participation from institutional investors, physical bitcoin traders and other clients who value the transparency, price discovery and risk transfer that only a regulated marketplace like CME Group can offer,” McCourrt said. Cointelegraph covered CME’s Bitcoin options trading unveiling earlier in 2019."

heirs when they die? In 2019, Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund 
colossus ...","Feb 1, 2020","Slowly but surely, institutional players are moving into the crypto/blockchain neighborhood.","According to a 2019 Fidelity Investments survey, about 22% of institutional investors already have some exposure to digital assets, with most investments having been made within the past three years. Moreover, 4 in 10 respondents say they are open to future investments in digital assets over the next five years.“Institutional investor involvement in cryptocurrency in 2019 has been primarily about getting the infrastructure in place, such as the opening of Fidelity Digital Assets and Bakkt,” Jonathan Levin, co-founder and chief strategy officer of Chainalysis, told Cointelegraph, adding: “Now that the infrastructure is in place, we expect institutional volume to come as long as they can get comfortable with the compliance and market risks of cryptocurrency.”Banks and insurance companies seem to be more engaged than other institutional segments, commented Levin, “but once institutional support from these key sectors are in place, we expect an uptake from investors such as funds and family offices.” Clearly, there is still work to be done — particularly with regard to compliance — but with that as a preamble, here are our top 10 institutional actors in the last year:In June, Facebook aroused the crypto — and financial — world with its announcement of a new digital currency, Libra, and the formation of a Switzerland-based, non-profit organization, the Libra Association, to manage it — with a mandate to “help reinvent money and transform the global economy.”The permissioned blockchain-based currency was to be tethered to a basket of bank deposits and short-term government securities. The new association began with 27 corporate partners, including Mastercard, Paypal, Visa, Vodafone, eBay and Uber.The project ran into immediate headwinds, however, especially from global regulators who feared for their own fiat currencies and the creation of a shadow banking system. Two United States senators wrote a letter to Mastercard and Visa, among others, expressing “deep concern” that the project could destabilize the global financial system — as well as facilitate criminal and terrorist financing. Apple CEO Tim Cook said companies like Facebook shouldn’t be in charge of a global currency. Partners exited, and, by late 2019, one-quarter of the original partners were gone, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay. Reports of Libra’s demise may be premature, though. Central bankers have been spurred to pilot their own digital currency projects in anticipation of Libra’s debut, and, in early December, the Libra Association was still projecting a 2020 stablecoin launch at least in some parts of the world, like Europe. In February, J.P. Morgan, the largest bank in the U.S., introduced JPM Coin, claiming to be the first bank to create and test a digital coin representing fiat currency. The goal was to allow instantaneous payments between the bank's institutional clients on a permissioned blockchain platform. The stablecoin was to be 1:1 redeemable in a fiat currency (U.S. dollars) held by J.P. Morgan — unlike most stablecoins, like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), that claim to have a 1:1 fiat collateral. It was slated to roll out in late 2019, but it had still not launched publicly as of Dec. 10.J.P. Morgan has been actively exploring blockchain and crypto-related initiatives for several years — notwithstanding the fact that CEO Jamie Dimon once called digital currencies a ""fraud."" Its Interbank Information Network, a bank payment and data-sharing network based on J.P. Morgan’s in-house blockchain platform Quorum, implemented in 2018, has some 365 global members today and will expand in 2020 to Japan. A new institution-sized exchange company joined the crypto world in September 2019 when Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which also owns the New York Stock Exchange, launched Bakkt, the first exchange to offer physically settled Bitcoin (BTC) futures contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, by comparison, has been settling BTC futures contracts in fiat currency, not Bitcoin, since December 2017. After a slow start, Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures volume edged higher through 2019 and, on Nov. 27, hit a new all-time high with 5,671 futures contracts traded (volume: $42.5 million). In early December, Bakkt launched the first regulated Bitcoin options and cash-settled futures in the U.S. The announcement came just a few days after Bakkt CEO Kelly Loeffler was named to fill the U.S. Senate seat of Georgia’s retiring Johnny Isakson (R).The incoming chairman of U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Heath Tarbert, said in October that Ether (ETH), as well as Bitcoin, are commodities — not securities — and, as such, will be regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act with the CFTC as its primary regulator. “My guess is that you will see in the near future Ether-related futures contracts and other derivatives potentially traded,” stated Tarbert. This statement provided regulatory clarity and some relief to Bitcoin and Ethereum developers and investors, present and future. If the CFTC was going to regulate BTC and Ether, then surely it wasn’t going to ban them, which is a real concern. In his first public appearance in October, Tarbert also emphasized the importance of blockchain and digital assets. The U.S. has been falling behind in blockchain innovation, receiving little support from U.S. policymakers and regulators, according to Perianne Boring, CEO of the Chamber of Digital Commerce. However, here the chairman of the CFTC said, “I want the United States to lead because whoever leads in this technology is going to end up writing the rules of the game.” This was an “incredibly important” development, Boring told Cointelegraph. Custody isn’t the most exciting segment of the crypto world, arguably, but it is a critical one, especially as the industry matures. It figures in many real-life investment decisions. How, for instance, will older Bitcoin holders pass on their BTC to their heirs when they die? In 2019, Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund colossus ($7.2 trillion under administration), stepped up with a full rollout of its Fidelity Digital Assets custody unit, four years in the making, which targets institutional investors like hedge funds, family offices and market intermediaries.The firm’s carefully charted deployment route was marked by a series of milestones: Initial research (2014), formation of a blockchain incubator and initiation of a proof-of-concept process (May 2015), acceptance of Bitcoins as charitable donations by Fidelity Charitable (November 2015), formation of academic and industry partnerships (June 2016), acceptance of Ether for charitable donations (September 2017) and Fidelity Digital Assets unit announced (October 2018). In mid-December 2019, Fidelity Digital Assets announced that it may add support for Ether in 2020 if there is sufficient demand for it.Settling cross-border trades is often cited as a promising use case of blockchain technology, and, in 2019, a global banking consortium moved closer to putting that proposition to the test.  In June, 14 financial institutions from the U.S., Europe and Japan collectively invested $60 million in a new company, Fnality International, that will build an Ethereum blockchain, upon which trades among the banks will be settled using a token called the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) — backed with cash collateral deposited in central banks.Spearheaded by Switzerland’s UBS in 2015, the Utility Settlement Coin project’s additional shareholders include Banco Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, Barclays, CIBC, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, ING, KBC Group, Lloyds Banking Group, Mizuho Bank, MUFG Group, Nasdaq, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and State Street Bank & Trust.One key challenge facing the consortium will be interoperability, according to Olfa Ransome, Fnality’s chief commercial officer:“Not only must interoperability be achieved between legacy and digital venues and platforms, but also between competing blockchains — to support atomic settlement regardless of the standards and protocols — and between different means of on-chain payment.”The platform is expected to be operational by mid-2020 once regulatory approvals have been secured.  In February, Virginia's Fairfax County’s Retirement Systems (FCRS) became the first U.S. pension fund to invest at least a portion of its retirement holdings ($21 million) in cryptocurrency assets. The allocation, through Morgan Creek Digital, was just a small portion of the system’s assets, “given that the blockchain technology industry is still in its early stages,"" explained FCRS to its participants. It reportedly invested another $50 million in a second Morgan Creek Digital fund in October.Pension funds’ conservative mandates have made them reluctant crypto investors until now; they are generally more cautious than hedge funds and university endowments. Bakkt drew many of the crypto exchange headlines in 2019, but the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the world’s largest futures market, notched the most Bitcoin futures contracts. At its height, in May 2019, CME was averaging $515 million in daily volume and more than 13,600 futures contracts each day. On May 13 alone, Bitcoin traded a record daily volume of 33,677 contracts, equivalent to over 168,000 BTC (worth $1.705 billion at the time). CME’s activity dropped toward the end of 2019, though — from a year-to-date daily average of more than 7,000 Bitcoin futures contracts in May to less than half of that by early December.  CME continues to expand its crypto product offerings, however, announcing in November plans to introduce options on Bitcoin futures contracts by mid-January 2020. Some industry players believe the Bitcoin derivatives market will one day dwarf the BTC spot market. In July, the insurance industry’s high-profile blockchain consortium, B3i Services AG, announced its first product, a catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage. The consortium expected it to be on the market for the January 2020 renewal season. Formerly known as the Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative, B3i, incorporated in 2018,   employs blockchain technology to reduce friction in the transfer of risk. Each reinsurance contract in the network is written as a smart contract atop an open-source Corda blockchain platform. The smart contracts are capable of automatically validating a condition and can determine, for example, whether an asset should go to a nominee or back to the source, or a combination thereof. B3i started with five insurance companies experimenting with Ethereum in May 2016. Today, the consortium encompasses 18 insurance companies and reinsurers from five continents — including Aegon, Allianz, Axa, Swiss Re, Liberty Mutual, Munich Re, Tokio Marine and Scor, among others. When it was reported in April that Harvard University’s investment arm, Harvard Management Co. (assets: $38.3 billion), was making its first crypto investment, it was hailed as a win for the cryptocurrency/blockchain sector, which has struggled to attract institutional investors with deep pockets. Admittedly, the investment in blockchain-toolmaker Blockstack tokens was worth less than $12 million, a drop in the bucket for the world’s largest university endowment, but following Yale University’s lead in 2018 — that school invested in two crypto funds, managed by Andreesen Horowitz and Paradigm, respectively — it could signal a growing trend among high profile U.S. universities. Other elite university endowments, including Stanford and MIT, have been quietly testing the crypto waters, reported Cointelegraph in May.Key obstacles remain, however, before institutions really plant their flag in crypto/blockchain territory. Chainalysis conducted a poll of financial institutions last November, in which more than half of the respondents cited compliance in one form or another as the issue preventing them from investing more in cryptocurrency. Also, 39% said they worry about the inability to control illicit activity, while nearly 18% indicated that they are unsure of their ability to comply with government regulations in the space. With growing commitments from heavyweights, like Fidelity, JPMorgan and ICE, however, and even stirrings from endowments and pension funds, there were clear signs in 2019 that large institutions are moving closer to embracing cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies in 2020. "

Hence, they anticipate Bitcoin to rally more than 100% this year. Increasing geopolitical tensions and the United States Presidential elections later in the year could also act as a catalyst for the up move.Crypto market data weekly view. Source: Coin360The U.S., which had been the leader in overall Bitcoin transaction volume since 2013 has been pushed to the third spot in 2019. The top two positions have been taken by Singapore and Seychelles. After a long time, most major cryptocurrencies are likely to be in the positive on a weekly basis. This shows that the buying has been broad-based, which is a positive sign. With the sentiment gradually turning around, can the top performers of the past seven days build upon their gains? Let’s study the charts.Bitcoin SV (BSV) surged about 43% in the past seven days to claim the top spot. The altcoin has been the best performer among major cryptocurrencies for the second consecutive week. It is speculated that Craig Wright, who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, submitted more documents to the court in an ongoing legal battle with the estate of former business partner Dave Kleiman, which might have details of a trust that holds his Bitcoins. Some analysts believe that this news was one of the reasons for the sharp rally in Bitcoin SV. Can the altcoin rally further or is it time to book profits? Let’s analyze the charts.BSV USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe bulls easily scaled the overhead resistance levels at $113.96 and $155.38. This shows that the BSV/USD pair is backed by momentum. After the sharp rally, the bulls might face stiff resistance at $188.69.Though it is too early to call a short-term top, the pair might enter a minor correction or consolidation for the next few weeks. If the bulls can hold the price above $155.38, it will signal strength and increase the likelihood of a breakout above $188.69.If the bulls scale above $188.69, a retest of the lifetime highs at $255.62 is possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the correction drags the price below $127.102, which is 50% Fibonacci retracement level of this leg of the up move.Dash (DASH) has found a place among the top crypto performers after a long gap. The altcoin surged about 29% in the past seven days. The recovery in price started on the news that Burger King Venezuela would start accepting cryptocurrency payments. Initially, only one store will accept cryptocurrencies but later, 40 other locations would join by the end of this year. Does the cryptocurrency show signs of having bottomed out? Let’s study the chart.DASH USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe DASH/USD pair has been a huge underperformer in the past few months. It slipped from a high of $188.5598 in June to a low of $38.2558 in late Dec. After the sharp down move, the bulls stepped in closer to $40.The relief rally has carried the price to the downtrend line. The 20-week EMA is also placed close to the downtrend line. Hence, we anticipate the bears to defend this level aggressively. A breakout of the 20-week EMA will indicate a possible change in trend.Above the downtrend line, the next level to watch out for will be $77.7262, which might again act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the current levels or from $77.7262, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks. The pair will pick up momentum on a break above $77.7262.Chainlink (LINK) was the third-best performer of the past seven days with a rally of over 24%. Does the current rise indicate a change in trend? Can LINK build on its strength over the next few weeks? Let’s study its chart. LINK USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe LINK/USD pair has largely been range-bound between $1.50 and $3 for the past few months. This shows that bulls purchase close to support of the range and book profits near resistance. The current up move can reach $3 in the next few weeks.If the bulls succeed in pushing the price above $3, a rally to the lifetime high is likely. Conversely, if the price turns down from $3, a few more weeks of range-bound action is possible. The pair will turn negative on a break below the strong support at $1.50. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) also benefited from the news surrounding Craig Wright. The altcoin rallied about 18% in the past seven days. This is the third consecutive week that Bitcoin Cash has been among the top performers. After the recent rally, is it time for a reversal or can the up move extend further?BCH USD weekly chart.

This shows a pick up in momentum.However, the bulls are struggling to sustain the price above $270.15, which suggests a few weeks of consolidation or minor correction. We anticipate the bulls to provide support at $241.85. If this support breaks, it will weaken the momentum. On the other hand, if the price consolidates for a few weeks close to the current levels, it will indicate strength and will increase the possibility of a move to $306.78.Litecoin (LTC) rounded up the list of the top five performers of the past seven days with a rally of about 18%. Litecoin’s mining difficulty, which had dropped sharply in the second half of 2019, has begun rising again.

While the fundamentals point to an up move, do the technicals also support a rally? Let’s find out.LTC USD weekly chart.

The buyers are currently attempting to propel the price above the range.If successful, the LTC/USD pair can move up to $66.1486. Though the 20-week EMA might act as a resistance, we expect it to be crossed. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is gradually moving towards the center, which shows that the bears are losing their grip.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $50. In such a case, the pair might remain range-bound between $50 and $39.252 for a few more weeks.

purchase gold using Bitcoin and other digital currencies. 5132 Total views.","Jan 13, 2020","OneGold, an online marketplace for buying, selling and redeeming precious metals, announced a partnership with BitPay on Jan. 13 that will allow crypto users to purchase gold and other valuable metals on Android and iOS devices. ","Through the integration with BitPay — a leading Bitcoin payment service provider that currently supports over 30,000 merchants, including Microsoft and Avnet — OneGold’s new mobile app will accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), and various stablecoins. In addition, BitPay customers will save 2% when using the service on OneGold.com. OneGold CEO Kenneth Lewis told Cointelegraph that the partnership will make wealth preservation available to everyone at the lowest cost of ownership available on the market:“Cryptocurrency holders are a natural fit as precious metals investors and can utilize OneGold to balance their investment portfolio. Using BitPay, cryptocurrency holders can quickly buy gold or silver at institutional pricing, save 2%, and create a nice balanced mix of gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies.”Bitcoin has often been compared to gold, with Bloomberg recently reporting that it is equivalent to digital gold, as there is a correlation between the two that extends deeper than both being safe haven, limited assets. In a new report, Bloomberg market analyst Mike McGlone characterizes 2020 as a prime year for safe-haven assets, suggesting that movements in gold will act as a proxy for BTC’s price performance. McGlone highlights the recent price increase in Bitcoin’s value following the U.S.-sanctioned killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. Shortly after this event, both the price of Bitcoin and gold went up. McGlone noted, “The precious metal reached a seven-year high of $1,600, while its digital protege followed, netting a 20% rise.”Notably, stablecoin operator Paxos has created a crypto-asset redeemable for physical gold. Paxos launched PAX Gold (PAXG), a gold-backed ERC-20 token in September 2019, claiming that the product is the first crypto-asset redeemable for physical gold. According to a report, each PAXG token will be back by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold. Token holders reportedly own the gold it represents, but the tokens can be moved like any other ERC-20 assets, which Paxos notes is simpler than shipping gold.Paxos’ stablecoin resembles the service model provided by OneGold, which was founded by precious metals dealer APMEX and alternative asset manager Sprott. The company provides millions of global clients with the option to digitally hold precious metals. When OneGold users are ready to take possession, they can convert their precious metal holdings into physical metals, which are shipped by APMEX the same business day."

For instance, blockchain ...","Jan 5, 2020","Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said that he believes a “privacy coin” will go mainstream in the 20s.","In a post published on Coinbase’s official blog on Jan. 3, Armstrong said that he believes in the 20s we will see the integration of privacy features into one of the major blockchains. He also foresees a cryptocurrency with such features to go mainstream in the following years:“Just like how the internet launched with HTTP, and only later introduced HTTPS as a default on many websites, I believe we’ll eventually see a “privacy coin” or blockchain with built in privacy features get mainstream adoption in the 2020s.”Armstrong’s predictions are interesting given the recent crackdown on privacy-focused cryptocurrencies and the apparent consensus that privacy should be one of the main focuses of Bitcoin (BTC) development.In March, the head of the Finance Committee of France’s National Assembly proposed a ban of so-called anoncoins. In May, Japanese exchange Coincheck delisted four privacy coins and the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association recommended that its members do the same. All of that makes Armstrong’s prediction that a privacy-focused cryptocurrency will reach mainstream adoption surprising.When it comes to the integration of privacy features in major blockchains, some may argue that the process has already started. As Cointelegraph reported in June, some fear that Bitcoin’s increasing anonymity may be a threat to anoncoins. For instance, blockchain technology firm Blockstream published test code for using Schnorr signatures on the Bitcoin blockchain in February 2019, which aids with the privacy on the network while also increasing the scalability. Discussions on possible implementation are still ongoing.Ethereum’s blockchain, on the other hand, in September 2017 added support for zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-Proofs), a particular type of cryptography that allows for the validation of data without access to it. At the end of October 2018, multinational auditing and consulting firm Ernst & Young announced the launch of its prototype implementation of ZK-Proofs on the public Ethereum blockchain.As Cointelegraph illustrated in a recent analysis, privacy in crypto is a contentious topic. The reason is that some believe privacy to be a fundamental prerequisite for peace of mind and security, while others are of the idea that anonymity is useful only to criminals.Furthermore, Armstrong also notes that a majority of the world’s billionaires will come from the cryptocurrency space in the 20s. He said:“My friends Olaf Carlson-Wee and Balaji Srinivasan estimate that at a price of $200,000 per Bitcoin, more than half the world’s billionaires will be from cryptocurrency.”As a consequence, he believes that the amount of capital invested in science and technology will increase and more people from the cryptocurrency industry will turn to philanthropy.As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, this last prediction is in line with a report compiled by digital asset management firm Coinshares, which estimates that Bitcoin aware Millennials are set to inherit almost $70 trillion of value from the Baby Boomer generation by 2045."

Let’s see if we find any buying opportunity after the recent weakness.Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below the 20-day EMA at $8,350 today but quickly turned around. This shows that the bulls are buying on dips rather than panicking and dumping their positions, which is a positive sign.BTC USD daily chart.

However, if the bulls can push the price above the 200-day SMA and $9,200 resistance zone, a rally to $10,360.89 is possible. However, if bears defend the overhead resistance level, the pair might remain range-bound for a few more days. The flattening 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint also suggest a consolidation in the near term.The pair will turn negative if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA and $7,856.76 support zone. Therefore, traders can keep the stops on their long positions at $7,600.Ether (ETH) has bounced off the strong support at $157.50. The 20-day EMA is placed just below this level. Hence, we expect the bulls to defend this support aggressively. The biggest altcoin is now likely to move up to $173.841.ETH USD daily chart.

The ETH/USD pair will pick up momentum after it breaks out of the $173.841 and $180 resistance zones.Contrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, there is minor support at $151.829. If this support also cracks, the ETH/USD pair will turn negative. Hence, traders can retain the stops on their long positions at $150.XRP had dropped below the neckline of the inverted head and shoulders (H&S) pattern today, which is a negative sign. The failure of the bulls to defend the critical support at the neckline shows a lack of buyers at these levels.XRP USD daily chart.

If this support also cracks, the pair can decline to $0.18339. Traders can set a stop-loss on their long positions at $0.1995.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down sharply on Jan. 23 and broke below the 20-day EMA at $303 today. However, buyers stepped in at $296.13, which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally.BCH USD daily chart.

However, if these break down, and the bears sink the BCH/USD pair below $270.15, it will be a huge negative. We will wait for the current bounce to sustain before recommending taking a trade in it. Bitcoin SV (BSV) turned down from the overhead resistance at $337.80 on Jan. 22 but bounced off the support at $236.

This shows that the rally has hit a roadblock, which could result in a minor correction or consolidation for the next few days.","Such a move will be healthy for the crypto markets because it will shake out the weaker hands. The next dip will also give an idea about the cryptocurrencies that have bottomed out and have started a new uptrend.Acclaimed veteran trader Peter Brandt believes that Bitcoin has bottomed out and is unlikely to drop to $6,000. In a market discussion with Cointelegraph, Brandt said that the fall in Bitcoin’s price has driven the weak hands out of the market and the strong hands have accumulated at the recent lows. Brandt also advised crypto traders not to aim for short-term gains but position themselves for long-term gains in Bitcoin.Crypto market data weekly view.

She called upon the US to learn from it.While cryptocurrencies have generated huge wealth for traders, they can also be used to give back to society. Over the past few weeks Australia has experienced some of the worst wildfires in history which are estimated to have caused irreparable damage to the environment. To help in the rebuilding process, Cointelegraph has partnered with the ecological preservation organization Oxygen Seven to raise money for the Australian Wildfire Fund. Donations can be made here.The news flow about the ongoing legal battle between Craig Wright, who may or may not be Satoshi Nakamoto, and the estate of his former business partner Dave Kleiman has again helped Bitcoin SV (BSV) become the top performer of the past seven days.In the early part of the week, the price of Bitcoin SV surged to a new lifetime high on the speculation that Wright had received a list of public keys for $8.9 billion worth of Bitcoin held with the Tulip Trust.However, later in the week, it came to light that Wright had not submitted any information regarding private keys. That led to a crash in the price of Bitcoin SV. After the hugely volatile week, what is the way forward? Let’s analyze its chart to find out.BSV USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe price of the BSV/USD pair shot up from a weekly low of $158.69 to a high of $458.74, which is an increase of 189%. Such vertical rallies are rarely sustainable. The bulls could not hold on to the higher levels and the pair has corrected over 45% from its lifetime highs.A new lifetime high is a positive sign but the failure to hold on to the highs indicates profit booking by the bulls. The long wick on the weekly candlestick shows that traders quickly booked profits at higher levels.The drop from the highs is finding support close to the previous highs at $255.62, which is just below $267.972, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally from $77.203 to $458.74.If the price sustains below $255.62, a drop to $222.95 is possible. Though a relief rally is possible, we anticipate the pair to consolidate for the next few weeks before making its next move.Dash (DASH) made the list of top performers for the second successive week with a rally of about 50% in the past seven days. It gained sharply in the early part of the week and then gave back some of its gains in the latter part of the week. There was no specific news that could be attributed to the rally. After a volatile week, what can the traders expect in the next few weeks? Let’s study its chart.DASH USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe DASH/USD pair rallied from a low of $63.7104 to a high of $142.3419 in the week, which is a gain of 123.42%. The pair picked up momentum after crossing above the overhead resistance at $77.7262, as suggested in our previous analysis.After the sharp rally, the bulls are attempting to defend the zone between $102.581 and $90.2989, which is 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally from $38.2558 to $142.3419. If this zone holds, it will indicate that the bulls are using the dips to buy.We anticipate the pair to consolidate for a few weeks, after which the up move is likely to resume. On a break above $142.3419, a move to $180 is possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $77.7262. After the recent rally, we suggest traders wait for a few days, for a new buy setup to form before jumping in to buy again.Ethereum Classic (ETC) was the third-best performer of the past seven days with a rally of about 45%. When the sentiment turns positive, the market participants buy on every bit of favorable news. ETC picked up momentum on the announcement that leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance would launch ETC futures trading from Jan. 16. After the recent run-up, can it build upon its gains or will it succumb to a correction? Let’s analyze its chart to see what does its technicals project for the next few days.ETC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe rally in the ETC/USD pair carried it above the overhead resistance at $10, however, the bulls could not hold on to the gains. This shows profit booking at higher levels.Currently, the price has again dipped back into the $3.40 to $10 range. We anticipate the pair to consolidate in the top half of the range for the next few weeks, similar to how it had done in June of last year.Thereafter, if the bulls can scale and sustain the price above $10, we expect the pair to start a new uptrend that has a target objective of $16.60. However, if the bulls fail to push the price back above $10, the pair might extend its stay inside the range for a few more weeks.The traders can wait for the consolidation to end and the price to resume its uptrend before buying again.IOTA (MIOTA) has been among the top performers after a long gap. Research company Fundstrat released a bullish report on IOTA on Jan. 16. While fundamental reports are a good read, they should not be the sole reason to take a trade. Let’s study the technicals of the chart to see if we spot a bottom and a buying opportunity.IOTA USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewWith the recent rally, the IOTA/USD pair has re-entered the $0.207622 to $0.5410 range. This is a positive sign as it shows that the market has rejected the breakdown from the range.The bulls might face resistance at $0.244553 but if the next dip finds support at $0.207622, it will signal a likely bottom. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has risen to just below the 50 level, which points to a range-bound action for a few days.Our view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.207622. If this level breaks down, a retest of $0.151096 will be on the cards. The traders can watch the next dip and initiate long positions after the price breaks out and sustains above $0.244553.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) made it to the list of top performers with a rally of about 23% in the past seven days. This is the fourth successive week that BCH has been among the top performers. During the week, it was overtaken by Bitcoin SV as the fourth largest coin in terms of market capitalization but it quickly reclaimed back its position. After its stellar run in the past few days, can it extend its up move further or is time for a correction? Let’s analyze its chart.BCH USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe BCH/USD pair broke out of the overhead resistance at $360 and made a high of $403.88 during the week.

If successful, the pair is likely to consolidate between $306.78 and $360 for a few days.Contrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the price below $306.78, the decline can extend to $270.15.

Invoking the phrase “SAFU” — a slanger term in the crypto community for “safe,” Zhao said:“Many hardcore crypto [organizations] advocate storing your own keys. But the truth is, today most people are not able to secure a key even from themselves (losing it). A trusted centralized exchange is #SAFUer for most people. The numbers speak for themselves. Need to work on wallets.”Zhao explained that he believes a centralized exchange to be safer option for most people. One Twitter user noted that the suggestion is particularly bad coming from Binance’s CEO, given that the platform has previously been hacked.In early May 2019, Binance experienced a major security breach resulting in the theft of 7,000 BTC, equivalent to over $40.7 million at the time.Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin disagreed with the idea — popular among cryptocurrency proponents — that users should be responsible for safekeeping their keys and the system’s designer has no responsibility to avoid loss of funds caused by key mismanagement. He said:“Disappointed at people replying to this with ‘crypto is what it is, it's your job to be super-careful and write down backup seeds in three places.’ We can and should create better wallet tech to make security easier.”Buterin mentioned the idea of “social recovery,” a system that would allow multiple people you trust to use their keys in combination to enable the recovery of funds.However, one commentator noted that social recovery systems have serious drawbacks, given that it makes multiple people targets to possible attacks. Additionally, social recovery requires a certain degree of trust for the people involved in the process. The prevalent immutability of the ledgers that manage most crypto assets is a big draw for many hackers, more so than traditional bank accounts. A bank transfer can be reversed while a cryptocurrency transaction in most cases cannot be, and thus the cybercriminal gets to keep their ill-gotten proceeds.Bad actors trying to steal crypto assets are increasing their efforts. As Cointelegraph recently reported, the crypto-stealing viruses employed by the Lazarus hacker group, which is allegedly sponsored by the North Korean government, were recently updated, demonstrating ongoing and adapting efforts.In reaction to the growing popularity of SIM swapping — a technique that allows the attacker to redirect the mobile traffic of the victim to a device under his control — United States lawmakers have appealed to the Federal Communications Commission to hold telecoms providers accountable for the consequences of successful attacks."

This follows an airdrop to a claimed 6 million people in December.The Reddit user claims that the government initially allowed the usage of Petro to buy products through a biometric app, but it soon shut it down as people flooded to the few stores that supported it.Some government exchanges are reported to support PTR as well, but the exchange rate deviated too much from the “official” price.The only option left for Venezuelans appears to be LocalBitcoins. Several listings can be found that accept Petro in exchange for Bitcoin or other currencies. However, all of them appear to be currently inactive. Several listings were still shown on the main page as late as Jan. 20.Source: LocalBitcoins.comCointelegraph reached out to Ernesto Pinto, one of the sellers on LocalBitcoins for clarifications.He confirmed that he does buy Petro from Venezuelans in exchange for Bitcoin (BTC). Pinto explained that the price was referenced from a local exchange, Amberescoin, which supported Petro. It amounted to 0.0036 BTC, or approximately $30 for one Petro.But the sellers are struggling due to the excessive selling pressure from the airdrop. Pinto is unable to accept Petro, as he cannot complete the full exchange cycle and sell the Petro he received previously.Pinto explained why:“The majority want to sell it because of an airdrop, where 8 million people want Bolivars because the Bolivar makes it easier to purchase things.”He also referred to a Telegram group where Venezuelans discuss and try to exchange Petros. One particular user in the chat asked for options in Maracaibo, the second-largest city in the country:“Anyone who sells food, rice, flour, sugar etc. and accepts Petros in Maracaibo?”"

Bitcoin's implementation of the Lightning Network are lower than ...","Jan 13, 2020",Researchers from cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX have suggested that the privacy and scalability benefits of Bitcoin’s (BTC) implementation of the Lightning Network are less than expected.,"A report published by BitMEX on Jan. 11 illustrates the researchers’ efforts to determine the growth of the Lightning Network by trying to extrapolate information about private payment channels from readily available data. The team focused on non-cooperative channel closures and they suggest that — since the network started its activity — about 60,000 such transactions took place.A non-cooperative channel closure happens when a Lightning Network node initiates the closure of a payment channel without directly communicating with the node that the channel is linked to.Non-cooperative channel closures are more easily tracked and recognized, and they have to be confirmed in blocks on the blockchain. Due to these characteristics, BitMEX researchers drew the following conclusion from the higher-than-anticipated number of such transactions:“The fact that non-cooperative closures are more common than many thought, means the privacy and scalability benefits of lightning are lower than many expected too. However, [...] as users learn more about how to use the lightning network and lightning wallets improve, the prevalence of non-cooperative closures could fall.”The report notes that researchers initially expected to find 30,000 non-cooperative channel closures but instead discovered the aforementioned 60,000. More liberal estimates place the number of such closures at over 90,000, cumulatively spending 1,405 BTC. The report also explains that in some instances, non-cooperative channel closures see a party attempt to steal the funds, which is called a breach closure. A breach closure can be followed by a penalty transaction if the attempted theft is detected and the other party claims all the funds. Attempts to steal funds in such ways are quite rare, according to the report:“Our analysis shows that these penalty transactions are very rare. Only 0.30% of non-cooperative closures result in a penalty transaction or 0.22% by value.”The Lightning Network, while promising according to many, is still largely experimental. As Cointelegraph reported in early December 2019, a Redditor “lost” four Bitcoins on the Lightning Network and later published advice based on his experience. He also suggested that users interested in the system should thoroughly research how the system works before using it to send significant amounts of Bitcoin.Still, Lightning’s promise of nearly-feeless instant transactions has the approval of many in the cryptocurrency community. In November 2019, bond market veteran Nik Bhatia said that with Lightning, Bitcoin has become an unprecedented asset by combining a store of value with medium-of-exchange scale and speed."

Ban Crypto",https://cointelegraph.com/news/verdict-in-india-imminent-rbi-cites-warren-buffet-skepticism-as-reason-to-ban-crypto,"As part of the proceedings, the RBI accepted the fact that it never 
implemented a ban on Bitcoin but rather “instructed” banks to simply 
refrain ...","Feb 6, 2020","Back in April 2018, the Reserve Bank of India decided to go ahead and issue a notice prohibiting all of India’s banking and financial institutions from offering their services to crypto exchanges, companies operating within the space, and individuals seeking to explore the nascent asset class. ","Following the ban, India’s crypto ecosystem was brought to its knees, with a majority of operational exchanges either folding up completely or relocating to other nations with more hospitable regulations. Additionally, the notice resulted in digital currencies being maligned across India’s investment landscape, with many casual enthusiasts starting to view the overall sector with an air of suspicion.This seemingly unjust decision was taken up in court by the Internet and Mobile Association of India, or IAMAI, a nonprofit organization that seeks to expand and enhance India’s online and mobile value-added services sectors. It is composed of a number of individuals currently operating within the Indian digital currency market, including executives affiliated with different crypto exchanges. The IAMAI’s contention is that the reserve bank’s ban not only falls outside its legal purview, but is also totally unconstitutional. As part of last week’s court proceedings, Ashim Sood, counsel for the IAMAI, started off by reviewing the fundamental precepts underpinning cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, as well as reading out the guidelines issued by the Financial Action Task Force in relation to digital currencies last year.Sood also explained to the judges the way in which many countries like Australia, Malta and Japan have been able to regulate their local crypto industries in a largely successful manner. In this regard, Sood laid out many of the stringent Know Your Customer practices being employed by various Indian exchanges, stating that the industry, by and large, had followed strict self-regulatory measures, but there was still a clear need for positive regulation to curb some of the issues plaguing the ever-evolving sector. On Jan. 28, the legal counsel for the Reserve Bank of India put forth its key arguments defending its move to ban cryptocurrencies from the Indian economic landscape. As part of the proceedings, the RBI accepted the fact that it never implemented a ban on Bitcoin but rather “instructed” banks to simply refrain from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges.Cointelegraph reached out to Nischal Shetty, the CEO of WazirX, one of India’s largest cryptocurrency trading platforms and a recent acquisition of Binance — a move that showcases the crypto giant’s faith in the overall potential of the Indian crypto market. Shetty pointed out:“Throughout the hearings, we’ve seen evidence of how the RBI hadn’t done any due diligence before releasing its circular banning crypto. Their move was arbitrary and led businesses to shut down or move outside of India. I’m optimistic that the Supreme Court will see the problems with RBI’s move and give a judgment in our favor. Huge props to our lawyer, Ashim Sood, for presenting solid arguments.”The RBI’s core defense included arguments claiming that cryptocurrencies pose a huge threat to the nation’s monetary system and overall stability. Additionally, the RBI also stated that digital currencies were being used mainly by bad actors for money laundering, tax evasion, financing of terrorism-related activities, and so on. Lastly, the RBI’s legal counsel argued that crypto should be banned simply because a number of high-profile finance experts and economists such as Warren Buffet are against it.To discuss this point further, Cointelegraph spoke with Sidharth Sogani, the CEO of Crebaco Global Inc., an India-based analytics firm focused on crypto and blockchain. In his view, there has been no research to date showing that crypto poses a threat to the Indian economy:“The crypto economy is less than $250 billion to date, if we assume that all the Bitcoin on this planet is used for terrorism and money laundering, still it will be smaller than the money laundering, terrorist funding, and other illicit activities funded by fiat money.”On the subject of Bitcoin’s untraceable nature and the claim that many people make use of digital currencies to evade taxes, Sogani stated that the RBI was simply making assumptions. He asserted that BTC is, in fact, traceable given that the right regulatory infrastructure is in place. In his view, if regulated entities like banks start accepting Bitcoin, the government, as well as regulators like the RBI, would be better positioned to track its movements:“Tax evasion is an allegation since they are assuming that all the transactions in India are taxed properly. 30% of all cash transactions in the country are not monitored by tax authorities, whereas local crypto exchanges are following all of the necessary compliances and are even filing their Goods and Services Tax! Thus, such comments are baseless.”Since the start of this legal battle, the RBI has reiterated that its ban was about protecting India’s investor community, as well as to push back against any illegal crypto-related activities. But per the legal rights afforded by the constitution of India to its citizens, neither the government nor any regulatory entity like RBI has the power to enforce such a ban. On the subject, Shetty added:“As our counsel pointed out in court, according to the RBI’s annual report available on record, there is negligible risk from crypto in terms of its effect on the country’s economy.”Sogani echoed a similar sentiment, stating that the RBI should first and foremost try to curb the illicit laundering of millions of rupees that routinely takes place both locally and across international borders. For example, he pointed to the 2018 Punjab National Bank fraud wherein jeweler Nirav Modi was able to scam the bank to the tune of $1.4 billion. Sogani then alluded to the Indian bank scam that saw hackers make their way out with $1.77 billion.He also pointed out that back in 2018, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented a nationwide ban on certain currency notes, the RBI issued a statement criticizing the move, which in hindsight, seems extremely hypocritical of the independent finance body. Sogani further told Cointelegraph:“The RBI is not allowed to take decisions or ban any economic activity which affects an entire industry. This is above their power, legal jurisdiction since the Indian constitution allows every citizen to run a legal business.”As the global crypto community awaits the Indian Supreme Court’s decision, a study released by Crebaco Global Inc. claims that if the existing blanket ban is upheld by the court, India’s economy could end up losing $12.9 billion. The data states that Indian crypto exchanges such as ZebPay, UNocoin and others recorded a total trading volume of around 40,000 crore rupees ($5.6 billion) last year. Additionally, trade-related activities from Indian IPs on Binance between January 2018 and December 2018 was at 7.9% — a number that clearly shows the booming interest among Indian people when it comes to cryptocurrencies.The study then proceeds to highlight the number of jobs that have been created thanks to crypto and blockchain technology. For example, Crebaco’s data suggests that in 2019, a total of 6,150 individuals were employed as blockchain coders and content writers within India’s local fintech market.Furthermore, a new research article recently released by the firm suggests that if the Indian crypto market were regulated, it could help provide employment opportunities to an additional 25,000–30,000 people within a short period of time.With all of the arguments now presented to the Supreme Court, it is quite evident that the Reserve Bank of India’s core issue with crypto is that people will start to make use of currencies like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ether exclusively for payment purposes, shifting the balance of monetary power within India. However, it seems the RBI has so far failed to understand that payment isn’t the only use case for crypto and that the asset class is viewed by a whole host of Indians as being an alternative investment avenue to regular stocks and bond options. On the subject, Shetty opined:“We should not pit Bitcoin against fiat because they both have different properties. One is deflationary, while the latter is inflationary. BTC has characteristics of property as well as of utility, currency, etc.”According to a poll conducted by Crypto Kanoon — an Indian crypto news platform that has been covering the aforementioned proceedings in real-time since they began — it seems as though more than 68% of Indians believe that the judgement will come out in favor of the digital asset industry.All in all, India’s relationship with crypto has been quite negative over the last couple of years. However, if healthy regulations within the subcontinent are established, they can help set a precedent for the rest of the world to follow. As things stand, the judge’s panel presiding over the case seems to have understood the potential that crypto and blockchain possess and how these technologies can transform the digital and economic landscape of the nation in the coming few years. The final verdict is expected to be released sometime within the next few days."

Source: Coin360In 2019, Bitcoin’s price largely remained in a range during the first quarter and made a decisive move in the second quarter. Currently, Bitcoin seems to be following a similar pattern of consolidation as of last year. However, with Bitcoin halving due in May of this year, the price action is likely to pick up momentum soon.While Bitcoin might take center stage in a few weeks’ time, currently, the altcoin space has been buzzing with activity. A few of the top performers of the past week are showing signs of having bottomed out. Do we find any buying opportunities in them? Let’s analyze their charts.Bitcoin SV (BSV), which was the second-best performer of the past week, has continued its momentum and risen about 15% in the past seven days. After the recent run-up, should traders book profits or can the price rally further? Let’s analyze its chart.BSV USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe BSV/USD pair has broken out of the downtrend line and has reached the first overhead resistance at $113.96. The moving averages are also located close to this level, hence, we anticipate the bears to mount a strong defense of the resistance.A breakout of $113.96 can propel the pair to the next target at $155.38. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI has risen close to the center, which indicates that the selling pressure has reduced.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current level. In such a case, the pair might remain range-bound for a few more weeks. The downtrend will resume if the bears sink the price below the $78.506 to $66.666 support zone.Monero (XMR) was the second-best performer of the past seven days, with a rally of about 13%. The privacy coin received a boost when Europol strategy analyst Jarek Jakubcek said in a webinar that the transactions conducted using the Monero blockchain were not traceable even after extensive research. While this feature might be positive, it will also pose significant hurdles from the regulators in the future. Has the altcoin bottomed out? XMR USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe XMR/USD pair has broken out of the downtrend line. This suggests that the downtrend is likely over. The price might climb up to the moving averages, which will act as a resistance. The flattish moving averages point to a likely range-bound action for a few weeks.A breakout of the moving averages might carry the price to $100 and above it to $121.427. Therefore, traders can buy at the current levels and keep a stop loss of $38. If the price struggles to break out of the moving averages, the stops can be trailed higher.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and slides below the recent lows. Ethereum Classic (ETC) was once again the third-best performer of the past seven days, with a rally of about 6%. This shows that the bulls have been buying at lower levels. Does the technical picture point to further gains? Let’s analyze its chart. ETC USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe relief rally in ETC/USD pair has reached the 20-week EMA. Above this level, a move to the 50-week SMA is possible. We anticipate the bears to mount a strong defense at the 50-week SMA. If the price turns down from this level, it might remain range-bound for a few more weeks. The flattish moving averages and the RSI close to the center also point to a consolidation.However, if the bulls can push the price above the 50-week SMA, the traders can buy the remaining position as suggested in our previous analysis. Above the moving averages, a rally to $7.6 and above it to $10 is likely.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $3.40. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the long positions at $3.30.Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has also made it to the top performer list for the second successive week. It rallied close to 5% in the past seven days. Do the technicals point to a further rally or is it time to book profits? Let’s study the chart.BCH USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe relief rally in the past two weeks has carried the price to the top of the $227.01 to $192.52 range. We anticipate the bears to offer stiff resistance at this level. The flattish moving averages also suggest a range-bound action for a few weeks.However, if the bulls can push the price above $227.01, the BCH/USD pair might move up to the 50-week SMA and above it to $306. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions as suggested in our previous analysis.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $192.52. UNUS SED LEO (LEO) with a gain of about 4% rounded up the top five performers of the past seven days. On Dec. 28, Bitfinex tweeted that it had completed the burning of the first 10 million LEO tokens. Let’s analyze its chart to see if we spot any buying opportunities.LEO USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe LEO/USD pair had been consistently making new lows for the past few weeks. This shows that the bulls did not believe that the price had become attractive enough for them to start accumulating.However, closer to $0.80, we find the first signs of buying. There is a small downtrend line, above which, a move to $1.025 is possible. The 20-week EMA is also placed just above this level, hence, we anticipate the bears to defend $1.025 aggressively.If the price turns down from $1.025, the bears will attempt to resume the downtrend. A break below $0.80 will signal the resumption of the down move. However, if $0.80 holds, the pair might enter into a period of consolidation. We do not find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we suggest traders remain on the sidelines. We will wait for the price to rise above $1.025 before turning positive.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

The famous former Olympic wrestler is not only bullish on Bitcoin, but also supports Charlie Lee-founded Litecoin (LTC), the seventh biggest cryptocurrency by market cap as of press time.In January 2019, Askren was purportedly sponsored by the Litecoin Foundation as the mixed martial arts fighter for UFC 235 event. Subsequently, the UFC fighter appeared on his Instagram wearing a Litecoin-branded t-shirt.The celebrity has also promoted Bitcoin on his Twitter in October 2019:“Just bought more BTC using  @eToro was really easy, now all of you twitter geniuses can tell me Crypto is a scam while my assets go up!”Askren has also recently retweeted to confirm his support of both Bitcoin and Litecoin:Source: TwitterAs Askren has been known as a shill for BTC and LTC for a while, a user on Twitter asked him a question: “The fact @Benaskren is staying quiet on XRP tells me its going to take it a long time if ever to moon.” Askren’s verdict didn't take long, and a part of the crypto community on Twitter expressed some negative stance toward XRP, while the tweet has amassed over 2,000 likes as of press time.Askren’s statement about XRP comes amid an already worsened situation around the coin as XRP dropped over 40% from $0.364 in 2019 to $0.183 in December, marking a two-year low. The situation has been exacerbated by rising concerns over the unclear regulatory status of XRP’s issuing company, Ripple, which faces a class-action lawsuit alleging that it held an unregistered sale of securities.Despite all this, CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently hinted at an initial public offering for Ripple, which undoubtedly has some implications for the fate of altcoin.At press time, XRP is trading at $0.238, up over 1% over the past 24 hours, following a major green trend on crypto markets."

Its shares bounced as the company plans further expansion in the upcoming year.","Argo Blockchain PLC is a company operating mining rigs for profit, as well as providing Mining-as-a-Service (MaaS) to institutional investors who are “looking to hold specific coins but do not want to procure via exchanges.”Based in London and listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its mining capacity is reportedly based in Quebec, leveraging the region’s cheap hydroelectric power.In a trading update, the firm reports that it expects revenues for 2019 to be £8.5 million ($11 million), a more than tenfold increase from 2018’s £760,000 ($987,000) figure, despite a significant slowdown in the last quarter of the year as markets cooled off.The company produced 432 Bitcoin (BTC) during its operation, compared to 426 in Q3 2019. Nevertheless, its revenue fell from £3.63 million ($4.7 million) in Q3 to £2.66 million ($3.45 million) in Q4, citing a decline in cryptocurrency prices, “increased mining difficulty,” and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.Mining margins, or the value of the currencies compared to the production cost, remained healthy at 52 percent in Q4 2019, despite a fall from 73 percent in Q3.The firm is making a commitment to significantly expand its operation, having almost doubled its mining rigs since the start of 2020. Its goal is to reach 17,000 mining rigs by the end of Q1 2020.Most of Argo Blockchain’s mining power is reported to be in Bitcoin mining rigs. As the Bitcoin halving is set to occur around May, the mining industry is feeling the pressure from a 50 percent drop in supply expansion rates. Bitmain, one of the leading producers of mining rigs, laid off 50 percent of its staff in anticipation of the event.Though Argo claims to have “one of the highest efficiency rates in the market,” the halving is likely to be a period of great uncertainty. The revenue shock might be compensated by an appropriate increase in Bitcoin price, as several experts claim the halving is not priced in by the market. However, others argue that it will not lead to increased BTC price at all."

Blockchain has launched full banking integration to enable users to deposit and withdraw TRY on the exchange platform.Crypto users from Turkey don't need a third-party payment method to buy and sell crypto on Blockchain.com Exchange. The release says that ""Turkish users can now deposit, withdraw, and use TRY to buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Tether (USDT) and convert their crypto into the fiat currency of their choice."" The lira is the fourth fiat currency supported on Blockchain.com Exchange, launched in late August. The platform also supports pound, dollars, and euros. Blockchain.com Co-founder and CEO Peter Smith called Turkey as one of the countries leading the charge to embrace cryptocurrencies, adding that ""Blockchain.com is dedicated to providing a fair, global market for Turkey's crypto traders.""Peter Smith's description of Turkey echoes sentiments from Binance CEO CZ, who told Cointelegraph in an earlier Q&A that ""Turkey is a vibrant country that has illustrated one of the strongest demands and fast-growing interest in crypto."" Shortly after the interview, Binance added support for buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with the Turkish lira through a local wallet partner.Huobi is another global exchange to establish a local office in the country. Their fiat gateway for the lira, first announced at the Eurasia Blockchain Summit last September, is still pending. But the Singapore-based crypto exchange has made some solid moves into the market by joining the Blockchain Turkey Platform and hiring ex-Deloitte Audit exec Alphan Gogus to lead the local efforts.While planning to keep an eye on crypto, the Turkish government also wants to support the adoption of blockchain in the country. Cointelegraph reported that Turkey has plans to establish a national blockchain infrastructure.

The Korea Times cited an anonymous official who reportedly said that the ministry has not finalized its plan, but noted that the government may impose a 20% tax on crypto income.News of the proposed rate follows reports earlier this month that South Korea is drafting a tax regime for profits made from trading cryptocurrencies. Some have speculated that the government may categorize gains obtained through cryptocurrency trading as “other income” and not capital gains. The other income category also includes gains made from lectures, lottery purchases and prizes.A clear cheme for crypto cryptocurrency taxation is much needed in South Korea. This became particularly apparent when, at the end of December, major local cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb announced that it was considering administrative litigation over an $68.9 million tax bill that it believes has no legal basis. More recent reports indicate that the firm decided to follow through and take tax authorities to court.As Cointelegraph illustrated in a dedicated in-depth article, South Korea’s cryptocurrency regulation has seen significant developments since Park Yong-jin, a member of the National Policy Committee from the ruling Democratic Party, introduced the first-ever taxation policy for crypto in 2017.In 2019, the National Assembly’s national policy committee approved a bill that would give more legitimacy to digital assets by subjecting them to more scrutiny and government oversight."

The company plans to allocate the raised funds to further development of the Lightning payments technology and scaling of its developer ecosystem.In the same announcement, Lightning Labs also introduced the beta version of Lightning Loop, the company’s first paid product. Lightning Loop aims to help startups, node operators and users send and receive on Lightning more efficiently, wherein users can transfer funds between the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain and the LN in a non-custodial manner.Stark also revealed that the company has seen over 30 companies that integrated its node monitoring tool called ldn so far, which allows node operators to monitor node usage in real time. Network reportedly motivated the developers to create a tool for preemptively spotting node and network issues.Cointelegraph reached out to Stark for comment but had received no response as of press time. This article will be updated pending a response.Lightning Network is designed to speed up blockchain-based transactions. It adds another layer to Bitcoin’s blockchain and enables users to create payment channels between any two parties on that extra layer. These channels can exist for as long as required, and because they’re set up between two people, transactions will be almost instant and the fees will be extremely low or even non-existent.Over the years, the Bitcoin community has come up with various proposals on how to improve Bitcoin’s scalability. They have yet to reach a resounding consensus. Earlier in February, a group of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology revealed the creation of a new cryptocurrency-routing scheme to speed up blockchain-based transactions.The solution considers that transactions are performed with minimal involvement from the blockchain, and claims to eliminate a scenario in which one of the users in the joint account handles too many transactions."

According to Pair, the company ...","Feb 4, 2020","During an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said that the platform would soon add support for more cryptocurrencies, along with a possible Lighting Network integration.","While Pair was unable to disclose which cryptos would be added to the platform next, he mentioned there’s focus on the top performing blockchains with the highest market capitalization. He said:“I’m not going to specifically name which ones we will add, but you can look at CoinMarketCap to see all the top blockchains and come up with good guesses in what we are interested in. We are looking at cryptocurrencies that have adoption, and work well for payments. We also might add some smaller ones that aren't as adopted, but are doing something innovative around payments.”BitPay, which has been operating since 2011, has become a leading Bitcoin payment service provider. According to Pair, the company conducts over a billion dollars a year in payment volume and has about 30 thousand active merchant accounts. Major enterprises like AT&T and Microsoft also use BitPay to allow customers to make transactions using cryptocurrency.While BitPay is well-known for accepting Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ether (ETH) for online and in-store payments, Pair has noticed that customers are requesting different cryptocurrencies to be used for transactions, noting:“We constantly get asked about XRP and a number of stablecoins. Our customers would prefer that we support all cryptocurrencies, but we have to make choices.”BitPay recently added support for XRP, the cryptocurrency used by Ripple’s payment network. BitPay’s CMO, Bill Zielke, said that BitPay merchants everywhere are now able to accept XRP without any additional integrations required. BitPay also supports 3 stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar –  USD Coin (USDC), Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard Token (PAX). The platform, however, has been criticized for not supporting Tether (USDT), which is the stablecoin with the biggest trading volumes. Pair explained that BitPay hasn’t seen strong demand for Tether. Moreover, he noted that the current speculation around Tether has left the company hesitant to add it. Pair also mentioned that the Lighting Network is “high on our list for what we are considering adding to the platform.” The Lightning Network adds an additional layer to Bitcoin’s blockchain, enabling users to create payment channels between any two parties on that extra layer. This ensures almost instant transactions, with extremely low or even non-existent fees. Pair explained:“The whole idea of the Lightning Network is to allow payments to happen off the blockchain so they don't take up space and storage, letting them achieve higher scalability.”About a year ago, a conversation regarding if and when BitPay would add support for the Lighting Network took place on Reddit. And although it would appear that some users are anxious for the integration, there is still debate that onchain Bitcoin transactions are better than lightning transactions. Pair, however, told Cointelegraph that the most important aspect for BitPay is listening to customer feedback. He said:“If our customers are asking for lightning payments, or Bitcoin cash payments, or XRP, then that's what matters to us. It’s perfectly reasonable for someone to perform lightning transactions on top of Bitcoin Cash or other Bitcoin-like blockchains.”It’s also noteworthy to mention that BitPay had plans to form a partnership with Bitcoin mining company, Bitmain, in 2017. The agreement would have allowed BitPay to help Bitmain develop open source blockchain security software.While a partnership between BitPay and Bitmain was established, Pair mentioned that there is no current relationship between the two companies. He said:“We collaborated on a project with Bitmain a few years ago, but there is no relationship with the company today. We would like to have them sell their miners through us, though.” Support for more cryptocurrencies and a possible integration with the Lightning Network may have some thinking that BitPay is positioning itself to become the next PayPal for cryptocurrencies. While this may be, the company has — like PayPal — been criticized for restricting payments in a few instances. A $100,000 donation to an Amazon rainforest charity was reportedly blocked by BitPay last August. The reason being was that charity organization, known as Amazon Watch, failed to meet BitPay’s internal standards. Last September, the Hong Kong Free Press also complained that BitPay was holding donor funds for weeks.Pair explained that the Hong Kong Free Press didn’t have their bank account set up correctly and that there were additional steps needed to be taken before transactions could be made. He said:“We have a tiered system at BitPay that starts with minimal documentation and then more documentation along the way. Often times things like this happen because companies haven't gone through verifications or gotten approved for higher tiers.”Pair also mentioned that BitPay takes regulations very seriously and that the company is fully compliant with U.S. regulations.According to Pair, being compliant in the U.S. is a main reason merchants choose to use BitPay over other service providers. “Some competitors haven’t thought through the full payment experience from a merchants perspective,” he said. Pair also attributes good customer support and e-commerce tool integrations as reasons for BitPay’s success. Although BitPay may have all the elements required to become the next PayPal, increased user adoption of cryptocurrencies is the next step. In the meantime, Pair noted that BitPay’s goal is to reach the point where people naturally expect to have the option to pay with cryptocurrencies wherever they go. He said:“Once you achieve that level of ambiguity, you will be able to spend cryptocurrency easily. The missing link now is embedding it, which is not something that will happen overnight. Rather, this  will happen like the evolution of the internet — I think we’ll see a similar story around blockchain payments.”"

With his project dubbed, Hive, Kohze took second place. The scholarship is set to allow further development of Hive into a fully operational platform.As the release described, Hive is geared toward changing the media landscape by implementing a molecular dynamic inspired incentive system, within which information can be added by users around the world. Detailing the operational principles of the system, the release reads:“Every content node containing information needs one or more linked nodes and every new link to a node has a dynamic cost to generate comprehensive knowledge networks. The resulting graph database is directly stored and maintained on the Bitcoin SV blockchain to grant a maximum of interoperability and transparency.”Commenting on the development, Kohze said: “With HIVE, I utilise the original Bitcoin protocol to implement a novel combination of game theoretical rule-sets to reconnect diverging perspectives in an increasingly polarised media landscape.”As digital currencies and blockchain technology are becoming more integrated into everyday life, educational establishments are expanding blockchain-based training services. Just recently, former MakerDAO contributor and Carnegie Mellon alumnus, Nikolai Mushegian committed 10,000 MKR — valued at just under $4.6 million at press time — to his alma mater to develop a research program for decentralized applications.The Africa Blockchain Institute will open Rwanda’s ostensibly first blockchain school in 2020. The new school has five key courses in the pipeline: a blockchain essentials certification course, a blockchain developers’ course, an enterprise blockchain course, blockchain for lawyers and blockchain for impact."

While some believe that Schiff simply lost his password, others, like Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, highlighted that losing private keys remains an important issue for cryptocurrency users.","Keeping custody of your own cryptocurrency is quite complex, especially for non-tech savvy users. Most wallets require the user to write down the private key before accessing the wallet. Storing the key can be done by simply writing it down on a piece of paper, a method that is prone to failure through the loss, theft or degradation of the paper.Using hardware wallets or encrypted digital backups is an alternative, but requires a degree of preparation and technical knowledge that many casual users may find too much to grasp.In response to Peter Schiff’s loss, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao argued that storing coins on centralized custodians is safer for most users.Nevertheless, this inherently goes against the principles of decentralization in the crypto community. Some members pointed to alternative methods developed on Ethereum as a potential solution.As an alternative to complex storing solutions, the concept behind social recovery is to grant friends, family or even companies the right to restore access to a certain account.The person losing access to his wallet would be able to call upon “guardians,” pre-selected entities that are authorized to re-assign control of the specific account.Argent wallet is currently a live implementation of this idea. A user can set other Argent users or even other wallets owned by him as guardians. By default, however, the guardian is Argent itself, using the person’s email and phone as an identity guarantee. Without other guardians this recovery method cannot be removed.Screenshot from Argent app.A slightly different method is offered by Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 2429, developed by Ricardo Guilherme Schmidt and others.Elaborating on the social recovery concept, it introduces “user secrets” — personal data such as biometrics from fingerprint scanners, a password, or personal information provided in a questionnaire.This information must then be provided during the recovery process, ensuring that guardians cannot simply collude to steal the user’s wallet. Additionally, the list of guardians is never revealed until the actual recovery procedure is activated.However, this is still a proposal under development subject to change.A commonly cited drawback of social recovery is the reintroduction of trust — this time in friends rather than centralized entities.Cointelegraph approached Schmidt for clarifications on the EIP. While agreeing that the system isn’t perfect, he maintained that the proposed system is far more trustless than simpler implementations:“Social recovery is fundamental for adoption, it brings a web2 experience to self sovereign accounts. The drawback is having to trust others, however EIP 2429 solves the problems of trusting guardians, so we are again in a trustless system, which is what we all love in Ethereum.”Elaborating further, Schmidt criticized open multi-signature implementations such as Argent’s for their failure to mitigate collusion. He still believes that they have a place in a setting where extreme transparency is warranted, such as holding public funds. Itamar Lesuisse, CEO of Argent, clarified to Cointelegraph that calling its system social recovery is misleading, as it “implies people always have to be involved.” He explained:“So the method is secure, and literally anyone with a smartphone can use it. Another advantage of this approach is that you can use these trusted entities to protect your wallet beyond just recovery. With Argent you can use them to lock your wallet and approve a large transfer.”Lesuisse also welcomed the development of EIP 2429, noting that “it improves privacy in the scenario where users choose friends and family as trusted entities.”Nevertheless, Schmidt conceded that the EIP is not immune to guardians extorting the user to gain access to the wallet, called a “griefing attack” in technical terms. He envisioned this being used in a positive setting, with a guardian company identifying customers and restoring access for a fee. Speaking with Cointelegraph, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow criticized Ethereum, noting that the EIP is “largely complexity for the sake of complexity.” He added that social recovery is entirely possible on Bitcoin with existing software, by simply creating a multisig wallet and distributing portions of it to friends.Nevertheless, Mow is skeptical of the general concept of social password recovery:“The drawbacks to any social recovery system is really that your social circles change over time, and we live in a universe that tends towards entropy. So, your friends today may no longer be your friends tomorrow, and even if your social circles don't change, your designated guardian may lose their part of your recovery scheme.“Mow still considers the ability to recover private keys as important, though he referred to hard metal backups — storage devices aimed to be indestructible. According to him, the burden of securing Bitcoin remains with the users:“The challenge is getting people to understand that they should secure their seed and plan for recovery from day one — social recovery doesn't help in negating the ""Schiff Paradox"" (people caring about securing their Bitcoin after it's too late) any more than metal backups do.”Since the early days of Bitcoin, Keybase has offered a private key generation service based on a user’s password and email.Torus allows users to create Ethereum wallets by logging in with their Google or Facebook accounts. The private key becomes uniquely-associated with that account through some fairly complex assignment mechanisms.As Schmidt explained, however, solutions based purely on personal secrets are extremely difficult to secure:“In Web2 is safe to have a 8 password, because the authenticating server will block bruteforce attempts [...] None of this is possible in blockchain, and using an 8 digit password as seed phrase, is probably an instant loss of funds, because is very likely that low entropy addresses are being constantly monitored.”"

Earlier in January, Visa acquired fintech startup Plaid, which also had a small cryptocurrency footprint.Worldline provides a large variety of services ranging from Point of Sale terminals, online merchant services to e-ticketing and fleet management systems. Ingenico is primarily known for its Point of Sale devices despite major diversification efforts. Its board of directors removed former CEO for 11 years Philippe Lazare in November 2018.One year later in November 2019, Ingenico had partnered with Pundi X, a project developing crypto-friendly Point of Sale devices. The crypto project used one of Ingenico’s devices to offer payments in major cryptocurrencies via its software.In August, Ingenico was one of the collaborators in an Austrian initiative to accept cryptocurrencies in several telecom stores.Ingenico’s share price has more than doubled in 2019. At a public conference call, Gilles Grapinet, CEO of Worldline, defended the company’s decision to buy it now and not last year:“Timing is everything. If you look at the stock price, it could’ve been a bargain, but I’m not sure the board of Ingenico would’ve been ready to sell.”Worldline itself has also dealt with cryptocurrency. In November, a partnership with Bitcoin Suisse enabled 85,000 merchants to accept crypto in Switzerland.The combined company’s stance on crypto is likely to be positive, but remains uncertain.

The Jan. 21 announcement advertises the trust as the first of its kind to report to the SEC. Grayscale’s full Form 10 is available here. Subsequent to this registration, the trust will need to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC, which will then become publicly available. In response to an inquiry from Cointelegraph, Grayscale declined to specify just when it will file the first of these reports but said the firm will do so in accordance with SEC regulations.A Grayscale representative clarified to Cointelegraph that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is open to accredited investors during the Trust’s private placement periods for new shares. GBTC, however, is the public quotation symbol for the Trust’s shares traded among retail investors on the secondary market.In the announcement, the firm makes particular mention of accredited investors — a controversial designation. Owning or purchasing shares from the Trust's private placement gives them the advantage of quicker liquidity with a reduced holding period of 6 months. Grayscale’s announcement arrives as the SEC considers changes to its accredited investor designation, couched in the 1934 act’s Section 12(g). Effectively, the SEC trusts the wealthy or executive class to invest with insight and thereby minimal risk. Conversely, the Main Street investor, the decades-old moniker assumes, lacks this insight.

He wrote:“To all employees of Bitmain: I am firmly opposed to layoffs! We don't need to lay off people! We cannot play suicide!”Zhan argued that Bitmain’s cash flow is healthy, and “there is a substantial amount of virtual cryptocurrency.” Zhan, who is Bitmain’s biggest shareholder with a reported 60% stake, outlined the company’s leading position in the highly competitive cryptocurrency mining market. He stressed that cutting Bitmain’s staff in half would just allow other mining firms to grab up Bitmain’s market share.Meanwhile, Bitmain “staff optimization” allegedly started this morning, according to local reports on Jan. 6. Bitmain has reportedly provided its employees with a compensation plan, while some employees have signed a termination agreement. Additionally, a number of headhunters have purportedly started communicating with resigned Bitmain employees.When reached for comment, a Bitmain spokesperson stated, “Depending on market conditions and business developments, we continue to make adjustments to our staff. As a result, we also are continuously on the lookout for new talent and welcome applicants from all walks of life.”The news brings a fresh twist in a series of events referred to as “Bitmain Drama” by the crypto community.

This essay is often presented as a manifesto of the open-source movement.The Cathedral and the Bazaar has expanded our vocabulary with new terminology. It also predicted the end of the cascading model of software development and the decline of the era of large software companies, thanks to the popular movement for free software. The central thesis of the essay is Raymond’s statement that “given enough eyes, all errors pop up.” He calls it the “Law of Linus.” — suggested by Paolo Ardoino, Bitfinex’s chief technology officer.Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, became a leader in the crypto community of China when he founded cryptocurrency exchange Binance in 2017. Today, not one major crypto event can do without an energetic CZ. Recently, on his blog on Binance’s official site, he compiled a list of books that he recommended reading over the holidays. One of these is Blitzscaling by Reid Hoffman. CZ said that this book tells in detail how organizations of different sizes work, as well as some consequences when teams grow to different sizes. According to CZ, this was very useful for Binance when the company planned its growth as an organization. Also, the book talks about recent topics including cryptocurrencies.Here is another book recommended by Changpeng Zhao. The author, Patrick Lencioni, describes how organizational culture contributes to the long-term success of a business and explains how to change the stereotypes that have developed in this area. This process requires considerable efforts from the owners of the company, but as a result, those who monitor “corporate health” become leaders, because such a unique advantage cannot be copied.The book is based on the many years of Lencioni’s personal experience, who is one of the leading thinkers in the field of business. He describes in detail the tools necessary for serious and interesting work.Wall Street Journal commentators Paul Vigna and Michael Casey write about the fears and rumors surrounding Bitcoin as a means of calculation and encourage readers to prepare for a new economic reality that will come.In their book, they tell the story of Bitcoin and analyze the role of cryptocurrencies in the modern world: How they came from and where they came from, what functions they perform, and what you need to know to be ready for a new world based on cyber economics.By eliminating the need for an intermediary, cryptocurrency technology supports an infrastructure in which strangers can conduct business with each other. This is achieved by transferring the most important function of maintaining accounting registers from centralized financial institutions to a network of autonomous ones.Bill Gates, a famous entrepreneur, public figure, philanthropist and former shareholder of Microsoft, traditionally shares a list of the best books to read each year in order to start the next year on the right foot.Vaclav Smil is one of Gates' favorite authors. In the book, the author explores growth in nature and society, and discusses how we can save the planet. Gates also warned that some sections of the book resemble an engineering manual. In the book, growth is presented as the goal of sterilizing humans and all living organisms. The book discusses the problems of tracking the growth of empires and civilizations, explaining that we can outline the growth of organisms in the individual and evolutionary periods, but the progress of societies and economies, which is not so linear, includes both decline and renewal.Despite the fact that the book is more than 2,500 years old, today it remains the reference book of many successful entrepreneurs. The laws and strategies described by prominent Chinese commander Sun Tzu are famously applicable in modern business conditions. The main thesis of the book is to know how to win before the start of the battle, counting all the moves, to know yourself and the enemy, choosing the right time, and using the whole range of tools and weapons available.The main thing is to be able to comply with modern realities, know the main managerial positions, not be afraid of risk and apply effective strategic laws in practice. This is a good book on management strategy, reflecting the skills and thoughts of the Chinese commander.One of the biggest business books of this year comes from Mike Isaac, a New York Times journalist who writes extensively on technology. This is a fascinating book that describes more than just recent events. The book describes almost the entire history of Uber, as well as the history of previous projects of Travis Kalanick, in which he earned a steady hostility to venture capitalists, which later expressed itself in relation to him in Uber. The book describes business details and the struggle with regulators. Recently, it came to light that Showtime is planning to launch a TV series on the company's success story, based on this book, and Mike Isaac will directly participate in its creation."

By using the blockchain-based platform, the club aims to track ticket distribution and also get rid of fake tickets. Though these are baby steps, it shows how blockchain technology can be used to find new solutions to old problems.After the initial fall due to coronavirus, can cryptocurrencies stage a comeback and will the top performers of the past seven days lead from the front? Let’s analyze the charts to find out.Hedge Trade (HEDG) is the top performer of the past seven days with a rise of about 13%. This is relatively a new cryptocurrency but it has quickly climbed the ladder and is trying to break into the list of top-20 cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.HEDG USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe HEDG/USD pair hasn’t been around for long. Hence, we have used the daily chart to analyze it. The pair remained stuck in a range from late August to early December of last year. Thereafter, it broke out of the range on Dec. 5 and has not looked back since.From an intraday low of $0.68654876 on Dec. 5, the pair rallied to a lifetime high of $2.67010910 on Jan. 24, a rise of 288.91% within a short period. This shows that the pair is backed by strong momentum.Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone. The pair has not dipped below the 20-day EMA since Dec. 5, which shows that the bulls have the upper hand.If the bulls can scale above $2.67010910, a rally to $3 is possible. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the 50-day SMA is likely.This is the third consecutive week that Dash (DASH) has been a top performer with a gain of about 10% in the past seven days. Let’s study its chart to see if the momentum can carry it higher.DASH USD weekly chart. Source: TradingviewThe pullback in the DASH/USD pair from the recent highs of $142.3419 was shallow as the bulls purchased the dip close to $90.2989, which is the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally. This is a positive sign as it shows that buyers are keen to accumulate at lower levels.However, we do not expect the pair to resume its up move in a hurry. We anticipate the price to remain range-bound for a few more weeks and digest the recent gains before resuming its up move.On the upside, a breakout of $142.3419 is likely to attract buyers. Above this level, a rally to $180 is possible. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the $90.2989 to $77.7262 support zone.Bitcoin SV (BSV) has again found a place among the top performers. This is the fifth successive week that the altcoin has made the list, which shows that it continues to be favored by the bulls.The price action in BSV has been volatile in the past few weeks as the market participants digested the various news reports on the legal case between Craig Wright and the estate of his former business partner Dave Kleiman.As a number of questions regarding the court case still remain unanswered, volatility is likely to remain high, albeit in a smaller range. While it is difficult to predict the news flow, let’s study the chart to analyze the likely direction of the next move.BSV USD daily chart.

The pair is likely to remain range-bound between $337.80 and $236 for the next few weeks. After the sharp up move of the past few weeks, we anticipate the BSV/USD pair to digest the gains.If the bulls push the price above $337.80, the price might rise to $400 and above it to the lifetime highs.Conversely, if the price dips below $236, it is likely to attract further selling by the traders who are stuck at higher levels. There is minor support at $222.950, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the recent rally, but if this support cracks, the decline can extend to $158.852.Ethereum Classic (ETC) rallied roughly 4% in the past seven days. On Jan. 22, The ETC Cooperative announced that Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest digital currency asset manager, will continue to donate up to one-third of Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust’s annual fees to ETC Cooperative. The funding will help support the growth and development of the Ethereum Classic network.ETC USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe pullback from the recent highs of $12.040 found support close to $8 level, which is a positive sign. This shows that the buyers are keen to get in at lower levels. We expect the ETC/USD pair to consolidate near the top of the $10 to $3.40 range.If the pair stays between $8 and $10, it will increase the possibility of an upward breakout. We anticipate a new uptrend to start on a close (UTC time) above $10. There is a minor resistance at $12.04, above which a move to $16.60 is possible.Contrary to our assumption, if the price slips below $8, it is likely to weaken further and dip to the next support at $6. Such a move will keep the pair range-bound for a few more weeks.Tezos (XTZ) has found a place among the top performers with a gain of about 4% in the past seven days. Though there has been no specific event that could be attributed to the rise, let’s analyze its chart to see if we spot any bullish setups.XTZ USD daily chart. Source: TradingviewThe XTZ/USD pair is range-bound between $1.65 and $0.82 for the past few months. This shows that the bulls buy when the price dips to the support of the range and exit their positions close to the highs.For the past four weeks, the bulls have been attempting to keep the price above the 20-week EMA. Though successful, they have not been able to achieve a meaningful bounce, which shows a lack of buyers at higher levels.If the price does not pick up momentum quickly and move towards $1.85, the bears will attempt to break below the moving averages. If successful, a drop to $0.82 is possible. The pair will start a new uptrend after it breaks above the $1.65-$1.85 resistance zone. On the other hand, a break below $0.82 will be a huge negative.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

and immediately start receiving Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies.","Feb 4, 2020","The hype cycles around cryptocurrencies are comparable in their ups and downs to the British weather. This is primarily due to high volatility, which can reduce the entire stash of a potential investor to almost nothing. ","Those who believe in the growth and prospects of cryptocurrencies are constantly in search of various ways to turn a quick profit. There are various platforms — for example, crypto exchanges — where it is possible to earn on digital currencies without investing in equipment. This method is suitable for those who follow exchange rates and are good at predicting the volatility of the market.Others rely on mining, as interest in crypto has been back on a rise due to positive price trends since the start of 2020. And mining with graphics cards is the most basic way to extract this digital treasure.But it is necessary to take into account the various nuances of mining. That is, it is not enough just to install the program on a PC for mining and immediately start receiving Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. Not even the best graphics card on the market can secure a definite profit right away.It is becoming more difficult to mine cryptocurrencies day by day, and using only one graphics card is not enough. It has become necessary to use several cards — at least four to six — that will complement one another. Therefore, investing in video cards for crypto mining is a very costly affair.Before buying any graphics card, everyone should pay attention to the main criteria:The memory. The core principle here is the bigger, the better. This is an important criterion for mining Ether (ETH). For most cryptocurrencies, it is better to use video cards that have at least 4 GB of memory.Speed. The best option would be to use DDR5 standard cards. They have a good balance between energy consumption and power.Cooling. An important element in the mining process is the protection of the graphics card from overheating. After all, mining puts a heavy load on the card, and, therefore, it is subject to wear and tear.Overclocking ability. Cards that can be overclocked work 20%–30% faster, which, of course, contributes to better efficiency.Bus width. The memory bus width of a card is a channel that connects the memory and graphics processor of a card. How much data the card will process per unit of time depends on the width of the memory bus. This is one of the key parameters that affects the card’s performance. The best option would be to use a 256-bit setup.Complexity of operation. Many graphics cards require detailed BIOS settings. Others need to be pooled together in large quantities. Most in the crypto community believed that it is best to combine four to six cards in a rig to make up a single unit.Potential. The main ability of a particular graphics card’s model is to remain relevant in the mining process of the most promising algorithms for as long as possible.Price/payback ratio. It is in everybody’s interest to recuperate the costs of the equipment as soon as possible and then start making money from mining. Therefore, this is perhaps the most important criteria to be mindful of.New video cards are released constantly, so it is essential to be aware of new releases. However, not all new video cards are capable of high-quality mining. Below are, arguably, the best graphics cards for crypto mining in 2020 from two major chip developers — Nvidia and AMD.Graphics cards from American-based company Nvidia are one of the best for mining. They have a good balance between performance and price. Meanwhile, their architecture is at the highest level. Here are Nvidia’s most popular cards:This graphic card is the weakest on this list, however, it is in demand due to its low price — just $140–$170. These cards are equipped with 4 GB of RAM. The recommended overclocking levels are 150 MHz for the core and 500 MHz for the memory.Despite its low cost, this model may not be suitable for everyone. The most profitable cryptocurrencies for this card are not well-known. The card is also poorly suited for Ether. Moreover, in cases when users need to put together several rigs, the GTX 1050 Ti is quite suitable due to its affordability.This card is rightfully considered to be one of the best. The memory ranges from 3 GB to 6 GB and prices start at $299.However, the 3 GB version of the card is not suitable for mining — the 6 GB card looks a bit prettier. The overclocking settings are 150 MHz for the core and 500 MHz for the memory. The low memory capacity affects the performance — GTX 1060 produces a hash of only 20 MH/s.Although this graphic card is superior to the GTX 1060 in terms of parameters, it cannot boast greater successes in mining. The card comes with 8 GB of memory only, and it has the highest output of all the aforementioned cards at 28 MH/s. However, the price of $300 per card, perhaps, makes it too expensive.This is one of the most powerful graphics cards at the moment. It isn’t a surprise because even the payback on mining occurs almost two times faster than with the 1070 series video cards. Many would advise buying such a card, but don’t forget that it costs a whopping $800. For a mining graphics card at this price, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti has a ton of power. It offers a hash rate of 32.2 MH/s, is subject to several modifications and has the proper settings. However, GTX 1080 Ti requires 250W of electricity, making it one of the most demanding Nvidia cards.The flagship Nvidia card. According to the creators of this graphics card, it is six times ahead of its predecessors and has 11 GB of memory. But the payback period for the RTX 2080, when mining directly, depends on its price and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The card works best at extracting ZHash, Ethash and Equihash. Despite improved characteristics and a very steep price that exceeds $1,200, it has many advantages.Graphics cards from AMD are also in high demand due to their similar performance but cheaper prices. Therefore, each time a new card is released, it sells out quickly.AMD cards tend to have comparatively short payback periods among other cards on the market and are capable of mining Ether.If users want to build a rig that will be relatively good on energy, they should pay attention to the Radeon RX 570 graphics card. The Radeon RX 570 is one of the best for mining Ether. Using the latest Claymore dual miner software, it can overclock all the way up to 30 MH/s running the factory BIOS. This card only costs $120.The Radeon RX 580, in terms of mining, is not much different from the RX 570 model. However, it is more popular with gamers, which increases the chances of selling it following an upgrade. It has a rather good overclocking potential and high-speed GDDR5 memory. Prices for this card start at $170, giving users a good bang their buck.For a long time, Radeon Vega was AMD’s flagship card. The card performs at its highest level and is the most profitable by mining the Cryptonight algorithm. It has 8 GB of video memory, and prices start at $280. Overclocking settings are 100 MHz for the core and 600 MHz for the memory.Like the RX Vega 56, the RX Vega 64 makes its best profits by mining the Cryptonight algorithm. This algorithm is based, for example, on Monero (XMR), which is one of the top cryptos by capitalization. Ether is in second place, which makes this graphics card a good choice. For mining, the parameter of Core Voltage increases, and the overclocking of the card occurs gradually at 30 MHz. The important point is not to overclock the video card too much because it is very sensitive to overheating.Unlike other AMD graphics cards running on the Polaris architecture, the hash rate of which gradually decreases, the RX Vega 64 is rather stable when mining. The card has 8 GB of memory and costs around $380.As for Radeon VII, it is rather difficult to find in stores. And the payback period is quite long. The Radeon VII graphics card has shown good results when mining, but it is unlikely that users will be lining up for it. For $750, users can buy 5 Radeon RX 570 graphics cards, which will be more profitable.It is quite difficult to objectively answer the question of which graphics card to choose for mining. The world of crypto mining is huge and has thousands of algorithms and is in a constant state of flux. Although new models of video cards appear all the time, there are special drivers for specific types of cards, and mining clients have been improved and modernized. The prices of top cryptocurrencies also remain volatile, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. Due to the presence of such a huge number of factors, it is simply impossible to select the best video card for any occasion. Therefore, buyers should choose a set of cards that will suit their needs when mining."

to the ECB than Bitcoin (BTC). This perception dovetails with ...","Jan 23, 2020","Stablecoins may represent crypto’s best chance of achieving mainstream success and recognition from the traditional financial systems. Just recently, the president of the European Central Bank nourished this viewpoint by stating that the institution should be proactive when it comes to digital assets. On Dec. 12, Christine Lagarde tweeted:  ","“My personal conviction on the issue of stablecoins is that we better be ahead of the curve. There is clearly demand out there that we have to respond to.”Being ahead of the curve and responding to demand may seem like contradictory terms, but Lagarde’s comments certainly highlight the value of stablecoins — crypto tokens backed by traditional assets such as fiat money. Elaborating on the tweet, Lagarde said stablecoins appeared more innovative to the ECB than Bitcoin (BTC). This perception dovetails with remarks from the IMF suggesting that digital currencies could bring significant benefits to customers and society.Because stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to recognized assets, they represent a novel technology that integrates the new with the old, assuaging the concerns of those who would otherwise view cryptocurrencies with a great deal of skepticism.Among their many advantages, stablecoins can be cost-effective by facilitating seamless, cross-border payments of blockchain-based assets and improving transaction speeds. Because of their open architecture, they can also be embedded in digital apps, a major upgrade on the proprietary legacy systems of centralized banks.One area, in which stablecoins offer a great deal of promise is taxation. In fact, they have a good chance of overhauling the hidebound, outmoded tax collection procedures, which means that only 14% of cash transactions are properly taxed.Related: Around the World in 2019 — A Landmark Year for Crypto TaxationIn an attempt to rectify this and put more money in public coffers, the California state government recently announced legislation approving the collection of tax payments in cryptocurrency. This came after Berkeley City councilmember Ben Bartlett became the first elected official to purchase cannabis — which is, of course, legal in the state — using digital assets including Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and the stablecoin Universal Dollar (UPUSD). The transaction was conducted using a special Android-based terminal, with the merchant receiving crypto (minus high transaction fees), and the local government, in turn, receiving real-time, paperless tax remittance. We’ll set aside the question of who achieved a greater high from this transaction — the consumer or the California tax board.Incredibly, the state will rack up a record $3.1 billion in licensed cannabis sales this year, and the black market is even bigger. This is partly because merchants have to pass overhead costs associated with running a cash business onto the consumer. It’s unsurprising that the government has started pursuing an alternative way of managing tax.As co-founder of Cred and the Universal Protocol Alliance, I was happy to facilitate councilman Bartlett’s historic purchase, which meant the taxman got his due straightaway. And I wholeheartedly agree with President Lagarde: The demand for stablecoins is huge — and the net gain for the state government could be just as big.There are a lot of cash-intensive businesses out there that suffer high crime rates, and the cost of cash is incredibly high. The cannabis industry is just one example. Although completely legal in the state of California, it’s like conducting commerce 20 or 30 years ago: You walk in, you go to an ATM machine, take out cash and hand it to a merchant.In the case of councilman Bartlett’s purchase, what the merchant and the tax collector got was a stablecoin. It meant no visit to the ATM, no high transaction fee and no security risk associated with transacting a large volume of cash on a daily basis. What is also unique, and why politicians like it, is tax collection happens instantly, and it happens with every single transaction, allowing city officials to accurately forecast their tax revenue.There is a lot of work ahead with legislators, merchants and various companies across the U.S. to allow people to leverage this ability going forward, but the process has started. By accepting stablecoins this way, the California government has recognized that it can implement a more lucrative, transparent tax collection process, while also eliminating the inefficiencies and crime associated with the current model, wherein cannabis merchants must adhere to a strictly cash-only policy.In my view, stablecoins represent the inevitable future of finance: assets that can be borrowed, spent, saved or exchanged. It may take a few years, but, gradually, the way the world views money will change. A U.S. dollar will be a U.S. dollar but in digital/crypto form. It’ll just be a better, easier-to-transact version of a paper dollar. A euro will be a better euro, and the technology itself — whether it’s ERC-20 or something else — will fade behind the scenes.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Dan Schatt is currently the CEO and co-founder of Cred and the Universal Protocol Alliance.

pilot Bitcoin leveraged trading. 3411 Total views. 133 Total shares.","Jan 15, 2020","The twelfth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, partnered with cryptocurrency-friendly Silvergate Bank to pilot Bitcoin (BTC) leveraged trading.","According to an announcement on Jan. 14, the exchange will serve as the launch partner for the bank’s Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) Leverage service.During the pilot stage, the exchange will only offer leveraged trading to select institutional customers. The only collateral currently supported by the service is Bitcoin, which will be custodied by Bitstamp as Silvergate Bank’s first exchange partner. Silvergate Bank’s friendliness towards cryptocurrency businesses is seemingly paying off as it has penned partnerships with major cryptocurrency firms.In late August, Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, announced that it joined Silvergate’s SEN network to offer 24/7 fiat transfers.According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2019, Silvergate Bank served 542 digital currency-related clients including cryptocurrency exchanges and miners, custodians and global investors, among others. Leveraged trading allows traders to borrow funds in order to increase their potential profits. However, such trading also comes with substantial risks as it introduces the possibility of losses that exceed a trader's initial investment. As such, many exchanges suggest that amateur traders do not engage in leveraged trading.Leveraged cryptocurrency trading is seeing increasing attention from Japanese regulators. As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) proposed lowering the leverage rate limit of cryptocurrency margin trading from 4x to 2x. The regulator reportedly plans to put the order into practice in April.By lowering the maximum rate, the FSA hopes to protect investors from “an excessive amount of speculation and the risk of loss due to volatility""."
169,https://cointelegraph.com,"Jan 27, 2020","Davos 2020: Awaited Regulations, Unexpected Enthusiasm, New Challenges",https://cointelegraph.com/news/davos-2020-awaited-regulations-unexpected-enthusiasm-new-challenges,"Following the news, the price of Bitcoin proceeded to swiftly rise from 
around the $8,200 mark to $8,455 within an hour's time. The consortium ...","Jan 27, 2020","Last week saw a whole host of world leaders — including United States President Donald Trump and Prince Charles of Wales, along with a number of other prominent dignitaries — come together to attend the 2020 iteration of the World Economic Forum that was held in Davos, Switzerland Jan. 20–24. As part of the five-day event, the WEF announced its decision to establish a global consortium for governing digital currencies — including stablecoins. Following the news, the price of Bitcoin proceeded to swiftly rise from around the $8,200 mark to $8,455 within an hour’s time.","The consortium will consist primarily of various traditional financial institutions, global government agencies, economists, academics, as well as members of the forum’s different communities. In regard to what the consortium’s core goals are, a report released by the WEF states that in order for digital assets to become a part of the mainstream financial ecosystem, they have to be governed using an innovative regulatory structure that is transparent, inclusive and interoperable in nature. Thus, the body will seek to create such a framework as soon as possible with the help of the public and private sectors.Lastly, in comparison to WEF 2019, where the crypto industry at large was at the receiving end of a lot of flak — with people like PayPal CEO Dan Shulman and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon bashing digital currencies for their perceived nonutility — this year’s event has seen a marked difference in how a number of high-profile individuals and companies have begun to view cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology — i.e., blockchain. For example, according to KPMG’s U.S. blockchain lead, Arun Ghosh, the accounting giant will be making use of blockchain (in conjunction with IoT technology) this year to help solve many climate change-related issues.Even though the WEF appears to have become increasingly more inclusive in its approach toward the crypto sector on paper, a number of experts believe that despite emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence finally getting the recognition they deserve, most of the talk surrounding crypto in Davos has been about nation-states and central banks issuing their own digital currencies — an idea that a lot of people believe is self-defeating. For example, in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Riccardo Spagni, a major contributor to Monero’s core development, was quoted as saying:“They’re talking about how it's going to be inclusionary, but at the end of the day, they still want to police it. They still want to regulate it. So, it's not really inclusionary. It's inclusionary within the same framework that they've always had. So, that's a little bit disappointing because you can sense that it's still like the same room full of old school bankers, old school regulators. They are reluctant to change.”He further added that with the global crypto community starting to become more and more unified in its cause to help spread awareness regarding this burgeoning space, the financial elite of the world are being given a clear message that “if they don't adapt, if they don't change, they're going to end up losing.”However, on a more optimistic yet cautious note, Mark Esposito, a professor at Harvard University and the Thunderbird School of Global Management, told Cointelegraph he is hopeful that with more and more people beginning to understand the potential of crypto tech, it seems as though the global finance industry is on the threshold of a new beginning:“You see all these senior people that don't need to talk about crypto the way they are now. So, it looks like 2020 is going to be the tipping point of a major transformation. We are waiting for a new narrative to happen, and fintech is part of the new narrative.”In addition to the forum establishing a consortium for governing digital assets, it also released a framework designed to help central banks create their very own state-backed cryptocurrencies, or CBDCs. According to an official press release, this latest “CBDC Policy-Maker Toolkit” has been devised in conjunction with a number of central banking institutions, economists and international organizations. In this regard, it bears mentioning that the Bank of Thailand and the Central Bank of Bahrain are already making use of this toolkit.News of the aforementioned release was met with a lot of market hype, with value investor Bill Miller and Boston University professor Mark Williams stating that this announcement signifies a change in how the world’s economic elite now consider crypto and blockchain technology.Also, as part of the Davos 2020 forum, Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi announced the launch of its new crypto brokerage platform that is designed primarily to lure institutional investors into this ever-evolving market. What makes the platform unique is that it offers its users zero transaction fees while making use of the “Smart Order Routing” model — which basically allows investors to get the best deals on their purchases. In relation to his company’s latest move, Huobi Group’s vice president for global business, Ciara Sun, said:“Institutional investors and HNWIs will be the major contributors of growth for the crypto economy in 2020 and beyond, but barriers like low liquidity and a lack of asset enhancement products are stalling widespread adoption.” Lastly, a spokesperson for Bakkt, a crypto futures trading platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, announced the release of an all-new consumer app that is designed to support digital assets — including a wide range of cryptocurrencies. With that being said, Bakkt’s president, Adam White, did say that the app will look more like a traditional finance product rather than a crypto fintech one.On the subject of how this year’s blockchain agenda in Davos compared to ones from previous years, Daniel Haudenschild, the president of the Crypto Valley Association, told Cointelegraph:“I think the level of discussions is healthy. I think what's happened is that the content has completely changed. I think anybody still walking around talking about crypto in blockchain now have something to hold on to. There's something serious behind their intention. There's no more fluff now because we've been through the Valley of Tears and many projects are coming to fruition. It's exciting. It's much more real. It’s almost like 2017 but without the hype.”He further added that 2020 seems primed to be the year of infrastructure development, especially because the market is seeing the entry of better players, institutional investors, and wealth and asset management companies — which is being driven primarily by negative interest rates. Haudenschild also pointed out:“We are observing a flush of new ASIC classes, tokenized securities, tokenized commodities, digital commodities as well as a rush of people trying to get the infrastructure in place — you know, the custody solutions, the wallets in order to be able to provide those services both on the banking side, but also on the trading end.”In Davos Cointelegraph also met music producer and innovative entrepreneur Alexander Shulgin, whose ideas regarding crypto mining have gained a lot of traction in recent years. When asked to expound on the subject, Shulgin told Cointelegraph:“Decentralized servers in regard to mining can help usher in a bright future for IoT-based technologies, smart cities and for so-called AI because, without computer processing, you cannot do any data mining.” He further added that this WEF, a lot of conservative businessmen and big companies were taking the time to understand the implications of the forthcoming industry revolution and how it will make local mining easier (by reducing the overall computing requirements) for everyone interested in the business.In addition to all of the activities taking place as part of the WEF’s core agenda this past week, many other satellite events were also in full swing at the same time — with perhaps the largest of these being the Crypto Valley Week.On Jan. 2, M&A PR Studio hosted the Blockchain Pitching Session, bringing together promising blockchain projects and investors at Davos 2020. An expert panel of judges chose to highlight three startups after difficult deliberations: Wom Protocol, Alethea AI and Bidali.CV Summit on Jan. 23 featured public addresses by a number of high-profile crypto personnel including MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen, ex-Cambridge Analytica’s Britanny Kaiser and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, among others. The topics of discussion ranged from how mainstream finance players can benefit from tokenization to how different countries administer their local crypto markets and beyond.To get a clearer picture of how much attention the crypto sector has been receiving from people all over the world this past year, Cointelegraph sat down with Cardano’s Hoskinson, who was in attendance at the CV Summit. In his view, Davos presents individuals with tremendous networking opportunities, citing his recent dinner meeting with Guns and Roses drummer Steven Adler as a perfect example of this. He then proceeded to add:“It's no longer just a bunch of nerds sitting around talking about code. We're really talking about solving real-life problems. And generally, the problems are always the same, which is this middleman of necessity that sucks value out of commercial connections between the edges. You have the AirBnbs, the Ubers, the Googles and other platforms like Facebook, where their product is their customer. And basically, they get so powerful that they get to sculpt an entire marketplace.”Lastly, the week also saw another important conference, TechPark, draw in many famous innovators from all over the world, who discussed artificial intelligence, education technologies, blockchain, Big Data, the Internet of Things, and virtual and augmented reality, among others. Some of the speakers at the event included Jorge Sebastiao, the chief technology officer of Huawei Technologies; Heinz Sommer, the CEO of HSO; Evan Luthra, the CEO of Startup Studio; as well as Cointelegraph’s Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, who participated in important debates on the role of women in the construction of fintech’s future. Despite the crypto-related announcements at the WEF being met with mixed emotions, a number of experts were happy with the fact that more and more world leaders are at least beginning to recognize the overall potential and utility of this novel tech space. In this regard, Francesco Pierangeli, business development and research associate at UCL Center for Blockchain Technologies, told Cointelegraph that he has witnessed a lot of positive movement taking place within the crypto and blockchain sector over the past year, especially at the WEF:“There is a lot going on when it comes to regulations, when it comes to which forms of blockchain are going to make an impact on society. And this is really what Davos is all about — how emerging technologies can be integrated into society for good reasons. There is a lot going on. And I believe that the more we discuss these topics, the more this stuff gets on the agenda of key decision-makers of the world.”Similarly, Jordi Puigneró, Catalonia’s minister for digital policy and public administration, spoke at Tech Dinner — an event organized by CV VC and powered by Cointelegraph. In his speech, Puigneró stated that blockchain will help usher in a new era of governance by empowering citizens and defining new models of trust, similar to how the internet completely revolutionized the way in which people connect and interact with one another. He further pointed out:“The government of Catalonia has already approved and is deploying a blockchain strategy in which one of the first projects will be deploying a self-sovereign identity for Catalan citizens. Digital identity will be an essential framework from which can be developed many new services of the digital economy.""The interviews in Davos were conducted by Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, Cointelegraph’s managing editor and head of features."

RBI case. During the last hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to clarify its position as to why exactly it enforced a nationwide banking ban on the country’s crypto market, as well as to discuss the seemingly unconstitutional nature of its aforementioned move. ","Ever since the RBI decided to go ahead and issue its controversial prohibition order, a number of public and industry-led petitions have been filed by prominent members of the Indian crypto community contending that the RBI’s decision was not only unjust but also in clear violation of the law. As part of its reply, the RBI’s legal counsel pointed out that the institution has complete authority to operate India’s currency and credit system and to protect the nation’s overall financial stability — if it feels the need to do so.In this regard, the ongoing petition that is currently being heard in front of the Supreme Court has been brought forth by the Internet And Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), a not-for-profit industry body that seeks to expand and enhance India’s online and mobile value-added services sectors.When the aforementioned case was reopened earlier this week, Ashim Sood, the counsel for the IAMAI, started off by reviewing the arguments that had previously been discussed in court last August. For starters, he once again explained to the judges some of the basics underlying cryptocurrency and blockchain technology and also read out the guidelines issued by the Financial Action Task Force last year. Additionally, after explaining how countries like Australia, Malta and Japan had been largely successful in regulating their local crypto markets, he emphasized the need for conventional banking avenues to be made available to blockchain/crypto business owners. Under such favorable regulations, investors, as well as casual altcoin enthusiasts, could gain access to digital currencies in a streamlined, transparent manner.Cointelegraph spoke to Sumit Gupta, the CEO of CoinDCX, an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, and he believes that Sood has proffered some good arguments on the matter of how the technology works, and how it can be used, given that the right regulation is in place:“On the question of anonymity with virtual currencies, he explained the strong KYC process practiced by various exchanges. He argued that, although the industry follows strict self-regulation, it cannot enforce them beyond a point, and hence highlighted the importance of positive regulation. He discussed that every new technology will have a grey side, however, positive regulations that curb the negatives are the need of the hour.”As part of its defense scheme, the RBI alluded to incidents, such as the Binance KYC breach of 2019, as being clear examples of why the crypto industry at large is still in its infancy, and thus, poses a massive cybersecurity threat to the economy of any nation where it is allowed to foster and grow. However, Sood told the judges that such cyber attacks were exactly the reason why positive regulatory measures were needed in India — so that the sector as a whole could be better equipped to face such challenges.He then alluded to a couple of previous judgments passed by the Supreme Court, which clearly stated that legal activities can be only be shut down if a definitive risk has first been identified by the Indian parliament and not by an administrative body like the RBI. In regards to the matter, Gupta added:“RBI’s arguments may sound inadequate, however, that is something for the judges to decide. Our judicial processes are strong enough and we have complete trust in them.”Lastly, Kashif Raza, founder of Crypto Kanoon, an Indian crypto news platform that has been covering the ongoing hearing live via its Twitter channel, told Cointelegraph that the main goal of IAMAI’s legal counsel is to establish the fact that the Indian crypto community is not trying to push digital assets as being currencies but rather as alternative investment options. He further added:“The IAMAI drew the focus of the court on the fact that nowhere in the FATF’s guidelines is it mentioned that cryptocurrencies should be banned completely. India is a member of the FATF, and most of the agency’s guidelines demand for KYC and better cooperation between members when it comes to controlling the cross border movement of crypto-assets.”Indian judges, who are currently presiding over the hearing, seem to be eager to learn about crypto-based technologies and the immense economic possibilities that they represent. For example, they have requested the legal counsel for the IAMAI to explain how cryptocurrencies were being regulated in countries like Australia, Italy, Malta and Japan, and whether or not instances of money laundering or tax evasion had increased following the implementation of these measures. In response, Sood proceeded to take the judges through a detailed comparative table related to different countries, their regime nature and how they were handling crypto-related matters within their respective jurisdictions. Furthermore, he also cited the example of Mt. Gox, and how its collapse led to the creation of an efficient regulatory framework by the Japanese government.Related: India’s Income Tax Department Is Secretly Training Its Officials to Investigate CryptocurrenciesThe Judges further requested a detailed explanation regarding how current crypto-crypto and peer-to-peer exchange models work as well as how digital currency trading actually takes place. Sood, in response, explained to the panel the various laws that are currently being employed in South Africa, the United Kingdom and certain states of the United States that allow people to trade digital assets in a fully legal and taxable manner.Lastly, the Supreme Court questioned the IAMAI about various suspicious services, like Silk Road, the dark web, Tor and onion routing, and how such avenues have been used by bad actors to abuse digital currencies in the past. However, the judges did concede that crypto, like any other technology, was not bad in itself and could be used for nefarious reasons when in the hands of the wrong people. To elaborate on the subject, Varun Sethi, CEO of Blockchain Lawyer, told Cointelegraph that “The RBI’s argument that crypto’s anonymous nature poses a threat to national security cannot be totally ruled out.” He added that, indeed, crypto can freely flow between international borders, while the cybersecurity risks are hard to deny. He went on to say:“However, such arguments are similar to challenges faced by other regulators also. The court would surely take cognizance of similar facts and how it was dealt with in other countries.”Even though the Supreme Court seems to be finally understanding the potential that crypto and blockchain technologies possess in regards to transforming a multitude of local industrial domains, it did express concerns regarding the use of digital assets for money laundering and tax evasion purposes. Digging deeper into this argument, Tabassum Naiz, founder of Bit2Buzz, an Indian crypto hub that presents users with a host of educational content, pointed out to Cointelegraph that recently, a number of established Indian financial/banking entities suffered heavy losses due to a host of different cybersecurity breaches and threats. Naiz alluded to banks like HDFC, ICICI, the State Bank of India, Axis and Punjab National Bank as having been embroiled in massive scandals related to money laundering and data breaches. While local cryptocurrency exchanges do make use of KYC protocols to minimize the occurrence of such issues, their measures are largely self-designed and, therefore, need to be validated by a central regulatory agency. On the issue, Sethi highlighted:“If an exchange’s KYC processes are stringent and also validated by a government regulator, then the argument that all crypto transactions are used only for anonymous trading won't hold valid. That's where government policy is needed.”Gupta, too, reiterated Sethi’s sentiments and claimed that self-regulation has its limits and that a government devised regulatory framework will actually strengthen the Indian crypto ecosystem — a point that has been sufficiently argued by Sood and his team this past week.Lastly, a World Bank report regarding mining-based electricity consumption was also read in court to highlight the potential negative impact of the crypto industry on India’s power sector. However, the judges proceeded to spell out the various advantages of cryptocurrencies and how they have the potential to serve the under/unbanked, as well as fill out the many deficiencies that currently exist within the Indian payments market.As aforementioned, the RBI has claimed that the reason it restricted crypto activities in India was because of a lack of clear regulations, especially in regards to things like financial anonymity, money laundering, etc. However, in the opinion of the judges, it was the responsibility of the RBI — and not the local crypto exchanges — to devise a regulatory system that incorporates crypto into India’s general financial framework. Essentially, the Supreme Court labeled the RBI’s ban as being a burden-shifting ploy that was unjust.Similarly, when the RBI stated that digital currencies were only being used by people who wanted to mask their identities, Sood told the judges that this information was factually incorrect and that many people merely viewed cryptocurrencies as being alternative investment options to conventional stocks and bonds.As things stand, it might be a little early to definitively claim to which side the verdict will swing, especially since the RBI has yet to present its complete argument in front of the judiciary. However, Gupta is confident that the IAMAI’s case is strong, and that the judges will see merit in the arguments put forth by the independent agency, “We are of the firm belief that the judges will see reason in our arguments and provide a judgment, which is fair and favorable.”It is expected that on Tuesday, Jan. 21, the RBI will submit all of its remaining statements regarding its concerns about cryptocurrencies."

Tweets Crypto Rant — What Is the Bitcoin Reference Really About?","Jan 16, 2020",A bill seeking to exempt personal cryptocurrency transactions from taxation for capital gains has been reintroduced in the Congress of the United States. ,"Called “The Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act of 2020,” the bill would establish an exemption for virtual currency expenditures that qualify as personal transactions. Users would then not have to report instances when they spent crypto whose valued had changed relative to the U.S. dollar on day-to-day expenses.Representatives Suzan DelBene (D-WA) and David Schweikert (R-AZ) introduced the bill today, Jan. 16. Schweikert introduced an earlier version of this bill in 2017 that featured a substantially larger exemption. Existing tax law struggles to cope with cryptocurrencies, as they sometimes behave as investments, sometimes commodities, and sometimes just like other currencies. It is to this last type of transaction that the bill looks to simplify for crypto traders and users. Currently, the IRS could hold crypto users responsible for paying taxes on gains earned and realized unknowingly, based solely on the value of their crypto at a time of purchase. Such a system would make use of crypto as currency incredibly cumbersome within the U.S. The newly reintroduced bill would exempt taxpayers from a reporting duty as long as the gains involved are under $200, which would generally only apply with major purchases or wild bull markets. The earlier version of the bill put this number at $600. The bill would insert a new category within existing IRS exclusions from classification as gross income. Taxing cryptocurrencies has proved a major sticking point in the U.S. In December, eight congresspeople sent a letter to the IRS asking the tax agency to clarify rules for reporting income due to hard forks or air drops. Last year, just before the tax reporting deadline in April, 21 representatives sent a similar letter to the IRS, likewise dissatisfied with current clarity."

According to an unspecified official at the prosecutor’s office, Vinnik was charged with extortion, aggravated money laundering, conspiracy and harming automatic data-processing systems.One of his lawyers said that after his trial in France has run its course, authorities are expected to send him back to Greece so he can be extradited to the United States. After the U.S. prosecution is over, he would be finally sent to Russia. The French investigation is ongoing and no trial has been ordered. Ariane Zimra, a French lawyer for Vinnik said:“There is no causal link between what Alexander Vinnik is being accused of and Alexander Vinnik.”Vinnik is currently in a French hospital after going on a hunger strike for 40 days to protest his detention. Vinnik’s lawyers also recently filed a complaint that alleges a violation of his rights on behalf of his children.Zoi Konstantopoulou, one of his lawyers, suggested that he is being persecuted because he is a blockchain genius and is seen as a threat to the banking system. He said:“Alexander’s crime is to be Russian and a person with extraordinary technological knowledge that could liberate people economically. [...] The Greek Minister of Justice has in essence decided that this person is going to spend his life being extradited, judged and then re-extradited, re-judged and yet again re-extradited and re-judged.”Vinnik is believed to be involved in the hack of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox since the 300,000 BTC stolen there were allegedly not only laundered through BTC-e but were also on his personal wallet. Given those suspicions, the Mt. Gox trustee contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and requested information about him.Vinnik was first indicted by the U.S. in July 2017. A Greek Court later ruled for his extradition to Russia in September 2018. In July 2018, however, local authorities ruled to extradite him to France, where he is now.The matter of Vinnik’s extradition is a major diplomatic ordeal with multiple countries trying to obtain his extradition.

lecturers on secure networks, blockchain and encryption. #Bitcoin · # ...","Jan 25, 2020","The biggest topic in the mobile industry over the last few years has been 5G. In an industry that has been starved for innovation in this interregnum between the launch of the iPhone and the full-scale integration of next-generation technologies like augmented reality, artificial intelligence and blockchain, the introduction of the 5G network has become a sort of catch-all for carriers and handset manufacturers to lean on as the promise of the future of innovation being just around the corner — a feature worth paying a premium for and upgrading that smartphone you bought just a year or two ago. ","Related: The Implications of Fusing 5G and BlockchainQualcomm President Cristiano Amon has recently declared that 2020 would be the year 5G goes mainstream, predicting approximately 200 million 5G smartphones will ship next year. Amon also suggested that: “5G [would] become broadly available across major metropolitan areas in 2020, then spread thoroughly throughout developing countries in 2021.” While this year might be an important one for carriers and smartphone manufacturers to sell the latest model of the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, the more crucial year for 5G might be 2021 when those networks aim to roll out their products to the developing world. Amon has additionally said he expects mid-band 5G to spread into Peru, Nigeria, smaller European markets and developing countries in Asia, ranging from Cambodia to Sri Lanka. In terms of real-world practicality for 5G, this might be when the rubber really hits the road for the technology.Despite all the promises of a sci-fi reality from self-driving cars to better AI-powered insights, the most immediate promise of 5G is how it might support the technology we already have in place: our mobile phones. Aside from moonshots in automation or artificial intelligence, or more practical use cases like better on-the-fly computer graphics and video processing, 5G’s biggest advantage will be the exponential improvements it makes to the mini-computers we already have in our pockets and how they talk with each other on these networks. In the developing world especially, 5G could be the most ground-breaking of game-changers. Related: 2019 to 2020: The Insiders, Outsiders and Experimenters in Crypto Regulation, Part 2Thus far, the smartphone boom has largely missed the developing world, though it remains a significant part of the global mobile market. While smartphone usage in the developing world ranges from about 24% in India to just over 50% in Brazil, the millions in the developing world still heavily rely on feature phones or “dumb phones” — more people have access to a mobile phone than they do to electricity.When 5G does finally enter the developing world, it will be most useful in servicing what will probably remain a limited infrastructure. Perhaps the most important thing? The future of payments.Just look at the impact of something like M-Pesa in Kenya. Launched in 2007, M-Pesa is a robust and diverse mobile money transfer service that allows users to pay for a variety of services through technology that is compatible with feature phones. M-Pesa is so ubiquitous that 96% of Kenyan households have at least one M-Pesa user. The technology has also helped many Kenyans living in extreme poverty move above the poverty line, with rural households increasing their incomes by as much as 30%.M-Pesa was able to become so successful and widely spread in Kenya due to a number of factors, including strong marketing, relaxed regulation and the lack of other viable options. Perhaps the strongest of all was that tautological commandment of the “viral” — as M-Pesa became more popular, it became, well, more popular. There’s no reason to think the process can’t repeat itself across the world in the 2020s, but it will require 5G to get those robust, localized networks running, along with improved front-end interfaces across a variety of mobile experiences to support those networks.On the front end, it’s hard to argue with SMS and text as an interface in the developing world, even as messaging apps like WhatsApp are gaining steam in popularity. SMS has decades worth of familiarity to billions of users, grandfathered in with the earliest cell phones, but it is still quick and nimble enough to work on modern networks without a huge data load. It can also easily, securely, quickly and safely pay merchants, buy goods or services, and make deposits or send remittances. It offers the holy grail of digital banking, especially for the world’s nearly two billion unbanked: Your identity, and the associated number, can work as both bank and clearinghouse. On the back end, 5G and blockchain offer the promise of a potent combination. Blockchain can secure mobile banking networks that will have to secure transactions on a very granular level, while 5G itself will make sure these complex networks don’t strain under the weight of blockchains.If crypto networks can deliver payments solutions to these populations, it will be a major stride forward for both the unbanked and underbanked. This evolution in banking could be the first step in additional needed changes for the developing world, such as providing better and more reliable access to electricity and high-speed internet, reducing the high fees associated with transactions and remittance payments, and limiting government corruption and general economic volatility. If that’s all 5G ends up doing, it may be a greater leap forward than what has already been envisioned and promised by all those in the mobile industry. The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Richard Dennis is the founder and CEO of TemTum, the efficient, quantum-secure, ultra-fast and environmentally friendly cryptocurrency.

In that case, the attorney general believes that Bitfinex used its revenue to cover an $850 million dollar loss from Tether’s reserves, which are designed to back its stablecoin USDT 1-to-1 with the United States Dollar.As Cointelegraph reported, the leadership of these four cases remains in question. Chronologically among complaints, Leibowitz was first to appear in October, while Young would file in Washington State in November before relocating to the SDNY earlier this month.

The acquisition, combined with our many fintech efforts already underway, will position Visa to deliver even more value for developers, financial institutions and consumers.”Plaid also serves cryptocurrency wallet Abra, while cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also uses the firm’s services to obtain customer’s banking information.Visa hopes that the acquisition will enable it to work more closely with financial technology firms. Kelly explained that Plaid’s acquisition transitions Visa from connecting buyers and sellers to connecting consumers with fintech services.The acquisition is still subject to regulatory and customary closing conditions and will have no impact on Visa’s previously announced stock buyback program or dividend policy. The deal is expected to close in the next three to six months.Visa has shown an active interest in innovations in the fintech sector. In October, Kelly said that the company is still in discussions with Facebook regarding Libra, despite pressure on the project from regulators globally. In late September, Visa announced that it partnered with the United Kingdom-based digital banking app Revolut. The partnership allowed Revolut to roll out its product in new jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore and the United States."

Young et al are represented by law firms Radice and Kirby McInerney.Such a classification would make Young’s counsel the flagship of a trio of class-action suits against iFinex that also includes Leibowitz et al v. iFinex — originally filed in October — and Laubus et al v. iFinex. It would, moreover, put them at the head of a more general “class” of those similarly situated as having lost money due to iFinex’s alleged market manipulation, which is a potentially massive group of Bitcoin investors.As Young’s legal team argues, their case“Contains expert analyses and original statistical analyses that are not found in the Leibowitz Complaint. Further, Kirby and Radice possess extensive, specialized experience representing parties in data-intensive financial, commodities, and antitrust class actions.”Karen Lerner, a partner at Kirby McInerney spearheading the case, told Cointelegraph that“Interim class counsel will be responsible for protecting the interests of the class at this stage. That can include representing the class through motions, conducting discovery, and eventually moving for class certification.”Lerner reiterated the assertion in the recent filings that Kirby McInterney’s experience both in this general area of law and particularly in assembling expert analysis for the allegations were working in favor of their spearheading the class action.As Cointelegraph reported last week, Young et al refiled their case from Washington State to SDNY, only to be followed the next day by Laubus’s case, which copied much of the language from Young’s complaint.IFinex, for its part, has responded to the allegations with strong language. Upon Young’s initially filing in Washington in November, subsidiaries Bitfinex and Tether dubbed the accusations “mercenary and baseless” in simultaneously published posts on their respective websites.Suspicion as to Tether’s role in manipulating the bull market for BTC in 2017 date back to research originally published in June 2018."

In September 2018, the country’s government signed a memorandum of understanding to regulate and establish licensing for crypto exchanges, mining operations and initial coin offerings."

Nai estimated that, if the local mining industry were to function at full capacity, it would bring $8.5 billion into the local economy.Banking sanctions from the United States and other western countries have hit Iran’s economy hard. Nai said that the country is in need of foreign exchange volumes, and that digital currency can help facilitate trade while importing foreign currency as well as be used to skirt economic sanctions.The official explained that the ICT Guild Organization is currently working to improve Iran’s cryptocurrency mining conditions. The hope is that local mining activity will see a renaissance through changing electricity rates and boosting cooperation between local cryptocurrency miners and gas-burning power plants. Iran has some of the lowest energy prices in the world at $0.007 per kilowatt-hour. However, recent energy shortages and blackouts have led regulators to take a more active role in managing the country’s power supplies and therefore, take a strict approach to cryptocurrency mining.The rise of cryptocurrency mining in Iran led the government to raise its electricity tariffs for the sector significantly from the aforementioned $0.007 to $0.07 per hour — the same price as electricity exports. In August 2019, Iranian police arrested an individual smuggling in unregistered cryptocurrency mining machines. As Cointelegraph reported the following November, the country’s authorities went so far as to offer a bounty to anyone who exposes unauthorized mining operations in the country."

Wright's alleged misappropriation of over a million Bitcoin (BTC) that 
he ...","Feb 5, 2020",The counsel for the estate of Dave Kleiman has accused self-proclaimed “Satoshi Nakamoto” Craig Wright of abusing attorney client privilege to withhold documents and confuse trial proceedings.,"On Feb. 2, plaintiff Ira Kleiman — the late Dave Kleiman’s brother and personal representative of the estate — filed a memorandum challenging Craig’s privilege designations with the United States Southern District Court of Florida. The memorandum is the latest turn in an ongoing litigation saga over Wright’s alleged misappropriation of over a million Bitcoin (BTC) that he and Kleiman ostensibly jointly mined in the early years of the cryptocurrency between 2009 and 2013. “To  say that  discovery in  this case has  been challenging  would be a dramatic understatement,” the memorandum begins, claiming that:“An  adversary  [Wright] who  submits false  declarations, offers  contradictory perjurious testimony  under oath, and submits false documents  that even his own counsel are forced to disavow, severely hinders the ability to seek the truth.”The latest in this alleged “pattern of obfuscation,” the memorandum argues, is Wright’s set of “sweeping assertions of attorney-client, work-product and joint defense privileges” to ostensibly jeopardize trial proceedings. The memorandum notes that Wright has asserted privilege over 11,000 documents, with a further 2,100 purportedly added just in the week before the filing.Most pernicious, the plaintiff claims, is the apparent web of companies Wright is attempting to use in order to shield these documents — expected to end up numbering in the “tens of thousands” — all the while disavowing that he has any control over them:“Defendant cannot use these entities as both a sword (assertion of privileges) and a shield (claiming to not be able to access company documents).”Moreover, the plaintiff argues, almost all of the companies invoked by Wright to assert privileges no longer exist. Given that the law is explicit in establishing that a company’s privilege “dies with it,” Wright should now be ordered to immediately produce all the documents associated with the dissolved entities, the memorandum states.Beyond challenging Wright’s privilege assertions and professed lack of control or access, the counsel accuses him of lacking any explanation for having begun to cite joint defense privilege as grounds to withhold documents. The memorandum further claims Wright is unduly withholding selected communications on the grounds of attorney-client privilege.In late August, Judge Bruce E. Reinhart ruled in favor of the Kleiman estate, reproaching Wright at the time for engaging in a “willful and bad faith pattern of obstructive behavior.” This behavior included “filing a false declaration, knowingly producing a fraudulent trust document, and giving perjurious testimony.”In mid-January, the court granted the Kleiman’s estate request for an extension of 90 days, after Wright’s counsel produced its 20,000+ documents shortly before the discovery deadline.These are the documents which ostenbily pertain to the trust in which the misappropriated Bitcoin is custodied, known as the Tulip Trust. “I’m smart enough not to be [a Trustee],” Wright quipped, in an interview with Cointelegraph last month, “because then people could actually force me to move coins [...] lots of greedy people in the past have tried to take money from me.”"

Julius Baer has not disclosed which assets exactly it will be offering.As reported, Seba was granted its FINMA license the same day as fellow Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum.In December 2019, SEBA expanded its services to institutional clients and accredited investors in nine new countries. The bank offers a range of crypto-focused account services, including a SEBAwallet app, e-banking services and SEBA card facilities, with support for five major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC) and Ether Classic (ETC). It also provides investors with both crypto-crypto and crypto-fiat conversion services and offers enterprise accounts for blockchain firms and their employees.Like Seba, Sygnum is eyeing global expansion and has ostensibly entered talks with regulators to seal a banking license in Singapore.In fall 2019, Cointelegraph reported on remarks by Christian Gattiker-Ericsson — Julius Baer’s chief strategist and head of research and investment solutions — who argued that cryptocurrencies remain at a stage of a “Darwinian” process of selection, in which a clear winner remains to be established. Gattiker-Ericsson also said blockchain technology would  “possibly change the rules of the game” in financial services."

If every miner/pool does this, it amounts to about $1.5MM donation per year!”With 1% donated on a consistent basis, Lee’s suggested solution would provide enough funding for Litecoin permanently going forward, Lee confirmed to Cointelegraph.He explained:“At current LTC price, 1% of block rewards is about 7x Litecoin Foundation's yearly expenses. Even if a small percent of miners are generous enough to donate, the foundation would be able to put it to good use by funding developers to work on Litecoin Core, Mimble Wimble, LiteWallet, LN wallet, hosting the yearly Litecoin Summit, and pushing for adoption of Litecoin by merchants and users.”Lee also confirmed such donations are voluntary, adding, “It wouldn’t be right if it wasn’t voluntary.” Garnering enough capital to run and operate a business can be difficult. The situation becomes more complicated when the business or project aims for decentralization. Rumors circulated in late 2019 regarding the Litecoin Foundation’s potential bankruptcy, which Lee denied in an Oct. 13 tweet. “Don't listen to stupid fud and lies,” Lee said. “We have enough money to last 2 years.”Lee’s 1% voluntary donation proposal comes after Bitcoin Cash (BCH) proponents Roger Ver and Jihan Wu suggested an “infrastructure funding plan,” requiring miners to pay 12.5% of block rewards to an operation in Hong Kong, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 24. In response to 51% attack concerns, Dogecoin merged its mining with Litecoin in 2014, enabling simultaneous mining of the two assets. Notably, this joint Litecoin and Dogecoin mining impacts Lee’s new mining pool donation concept. “Currently with merged mining of Dogecoin and other Scrypt coins, miners make 105%+ of block rewards,” Lee noted in a second tweet. “So 1% is a reasonably small amount to give back towards funding a public good.” Finally, Lee also toyed with the idea of miners choosing which Litecoin project their funds will go toward, asking the community for their opinions on his ideas as a whole.""It's important that miners can choose to support other Litecoin organizations as well,” he told Cointelegraph. “Miners should donate to the organizations that want to help out."""

Jared Maples, Director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland ...","Jan 15, 2020",The House Financial Services Committee has raised concerns over the use of cryptocurrencies to fund domestic terrorism in the United States.,"In a Jan. 15 hearing, the FSC Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy has examined how U.S. financial institutions can combat domestic terrorism, extremism and acts of hate.Titled “A Persistent and Evolving Threat: An Examination of the Financing of Domestic Terrorism and Extremism,” the hearing featured five witnesses reporting on various fundraising methods used by organized domestic extremists. Particularly, the officials and executives have outlined crypto as an important fundraising tool for hate crimes, emphasizing that criminal funding is often distributed via popular social media platforms like Facebook and Telegram.Jared Maples, Director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, the first witness to address the matter in the hearing, stressed that the U.S. authorities should be closely looking to the use of crypto in funding acts of domestic extremism. Noting that foreign terrorist organizations have used Telegram and Facebook to solicit funding through Bitcoin (BTC) the official listed a number of incidents that involved the cryptocurrency.Projecting that organized domestic extremists will continue to fund their activities via crypto alongside selling counterfeit goods, drug and weapon trafficking, cigarette smuggling, Maples called Congress to not ignore the industry as a source of funding hate crimes in the U.S.:“We cannot discount the future role of cryptocurrencies in funding acts of domestic extremism, both within New Jersey and across the United States.”Rena Miller, specialist in financial economics at the Congressional Research Service, pointed out that combating the financing of extremist groups in the U.S. poses some new challenges due to the emergence of newer online methods of fundraising. In this regard, the executive cited a 2017 study by the Anti Defamation League (ADL) that claims that supremacy groups in the U.S. tend to be decentralized rather than highly organized, often relying on crypto.As the study also outlined the role of social media and crypto for these domestic extremists, Miller suggested that the U.S. government should be collecting and analyzing financial data more extensively. As part of the effort, authorities should have access to data provided on social media and payment processors. She said:“Cross-cutting issues that span different areas of congressional oversight may become more important; for example, access to data provided on social media sites and payment platforms.”George Selim, senior vice president of programs at the Anti-Defamation League, emphasized that transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are still transparent and can be tracked despite its anonymous character. In this context, Selim mentioned Neonazi BTC Tracker, a Twitter bot that posts information related to certain identified Bitcoin wallets. Specifically, Selim noted that Stormfront, the oldest and largest white supremacist website on the Internet, received about $30,000 in Bitcoin prior to October 2017, while white supremacist hacker Andrew Auernheimer received more than a million dollars in the cryptocurrency.The executive concluded that Congress should fund a significant study into how crypto is used in funding domestic hate crimes. Selim also suggested that the U.S. should create a certain framework that allows platforms that enables crypto-related platforms track online transactions and prevent the potential for exploitation of their services. He noted:“New forms of financial products and services, including cryptocurrencies, should be addressed. Analysis should cover challenges as well as opportunities inherent in these new financial products and services for those endeavoring to stop the funding of hate and violence.”While the U.S. is trying to address all possible terrorist financing loopholes against the backdrop of disturbing rise of domestic terrorism and hate crimes, some experts claim that crypto is “poor form of money” for terrorists. Back in 2018, U.S. Congress concluded that terrorist groups that attempted to raise funds via crypto have not had great success. Similarly, U.S. nonprofit think tank RAND Corporation said that crypto is not well-suited for the needs of terrorist groups.Meanwhile, the European Union has recently enforced another important anti-money laundering law that aims to bring more transparency to financial transactions for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Came into effect on Jan. 10, the European Union’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive has apparently forced some crypto firms in Europe to shut down their businesses, partly due to requirements to disclose too much information about their clients."

The high demand signals interest from China’s government amid confusing regulations on cryptocurrencies.,"The handbook was first released in November, and includes a comprehensive set of 23 articles, starting from the basics of digital currencies to their impact on global finance. Yinan Zhao, a Bloomberg reporter covering the Chinese economy, explained to Cointelegraph:“It is actually a collection of published articles by officials and researchers on digital currencies. The views expressed in the book are not new. I think it meant to be a one-stop shop sort of thing for officials to get their head around on the concept.”Chinese Communist Party officials appear to be showing interest in digital currencies, given the launch of the second printing after just three months after its initial release. The book’s cover describes digital currencies as “inevitable in the course of history,” adding that the articles are presented in the “hope to help Party cadres deepen their understanding” of the technology.The Chinese state has had a confusing stance on cryptocurrencies and blockchain since their popularization. As the market grew, bans on crypto exchanges and initial coin offerings operating in China were quickly enacted in 2017.The government appeared to change its attitude the following year, releasing a primer on blockchain technology in August 2018. The manual was the first attempt to educate Chinese officials on the merits and pitfalls of distributed ledger technology, with the aim of fostering healthy growth. Indeed, the country was reported in early 2019 to be a worldwide leader in terms of the number of blockchain projects.Nevertheless, China remained largely hostile to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, despite the gradual thawing. Since early 2018, People’s Bank of China (PBoC) representatives considered digital currencies as inevitable but viewed the potential spread of decentralized alternatives as destabilizing.It is unsurprising, given this view, that China pushed for creating a central bank-controlled digital currency in 2019. Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of the PBoC, is reported to have started the project to ensure China would retain control over its monetary policy — instead of “externally controlled” Bitcoin.Retaining control over the blockchain ecosystem appears to be a recurring theme for Chinese officials. As Cointelegraph reported in late 2018, the Huobi exchange re-opened a China subsidiary — which included a Chinese Communist Party committee branch. Finally, in October 2019, Chairman Xi Jinping called for increased blockchain technology adoption, while specifically excluding permissionless cryptocurrencies."

is seeking to put an end to litigation filed by a former exchange ...","Jan 9, 2020","Mark Karpeles, the former CEO of the now-defunct Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Mt. Gox, is seeking to put an end to litigation filed by a former exchange user back in 2014. ","In papers filed in a Chicago federal court on Jan. 8, Karpeles contended that he is entitled to summary judgment as the main plaintiff in the case as Gregory Greene readily admitted that his initial claims were either untrue or unsupported. A summary judgment can be awarded by a court on behalf of one party against another “summarily” - i.e. without the process of a full trial. It is typically pursued when the moving party believes there to be “no genuine issue as to any material fact” and they are thus entitled to the judgment as a matter of law. In their introduction to the filing, Karpeles’ lawyers argue that:“After the resolution of the claims against the other defendants in mid-2018, rather than withdrawing claims based on allegations that Mr. Greene readily admitted in subsequent discovery were not true or unsupported, Mr. Greene doggedly pursued these claims. The time has come to end this litigation in its entirety.” Karpeles is seeking that summary judgment be granted in his favor on three counts: conversion, negligence and consumer fraud. As regards the first, Karpeles argues that there is no evidence to support Mr. Greene’s claim that Mr. Karpeles converted his, or any other user’s, Bitcoin or fiat currency custodied on Mt. Gox. To recover for conversion under Illinois law, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant has either wrongfully or without authorization “assumed control, dominion, or ownership over the property.” On the second count, negligence, Karpeles contends that Greene lacks evidence to support his claim that Mt. Gox lacked adequate safety procedures to manage the Bitcoin it custodied. Moreover, on a purely legal basis, the former CEO contends that Greene has failed to establish “a duty of reasonable care” owed to him that would be recognized under Illinois law. This alone, per Karpeles’ lawyers, is enough to warrant a summary judgment on this count:“Where there is an absence of Illinois law recognizing a particular duty, the Court ‘generally choose[s] the narrow interpretation which restricts liability, rather than the more expansive interpretation which creates substantially more liability.’”Karpeles further argues that Illinois’ economic loss doctrine bars Greene’s negligence claim, which he claims rests on an allegation of a purely pecuniary injury.In a lengthy review of the multiple points made in Greene’s original testimony, Karpeles has lastly claimed he is due a summary judgment for the third count, consumer fraud, on the basis that Green’s account ostensibly contradicts itself and is unfounded. As Cointelegraph reported in December 2018, Karpeles pleaded not guilty to prosecutors’ charges of allegedly embezzling approximately 340 million yen (around $3 million) from Mt. Gox and manipulating the exchange’s ledgers to inflate its cash balance.In March 2019, the former CEO was acquitted of embezzlement charges but found guilty of tampering with financial records. Specifically, he was charged with having combined his personal finances with those of the exchange in order to conceal the platform’s losses to hackers. The erstwhile CEO has since appealed this conviction as well."

mobile users and has garnered some impressive revenue in 2019.","Jan 15, 2020","The vast swathes of Africa’s fertile lands may ultimately prove a central arena for the ground-up development of innovative digital infrastructure and green energy projects. Recent pivotal moments in African trade, such as the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, are setting the table for an environment conducive to rapid growth, where both energy and financial infrastructure are a primary focus. ","Africa’s untapped economic potential is no secret. The continent’s population has soared past more than 1.3 billion, which accounts for roughly 17% of the world’s population and is mostly comprised of young people, with two-thirds of the population below the age of 24. Such a bulge in the youth of Africa has helped fuel the fastest-growing mobile market in the world, but one that still lacks a robust financial infrastructure. Despite the ubiquity of mobile phones (specifically Nokia), only 6% of Africans make payments with a mobile device. But that could all change soon. The opportunity for Africa lies directly with the ability to potentially leapfrog an entire generation of financial and energy infrastructure — a luxury that countries in the Western Hemisphere lack. And the world is taking notice. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was recently in mainstream headlines following an extended visit to Africa, after which, he announced that he would be returning for three to six months in mid-2020. The excitement stirred by his statement centered on his ongoing work with his payments company Square and its relatively new venture oriented on Bitcoin — Square Crypto. Related: Crypto in Africa: Opportunities and Challenges, ExplainedSquare Crypto is focusing on Bitcoin payment and investment solutions for mobile users and has garnered some impressive revenue in 2019. However, those results have largely been confined to the U.S. — something Dorsey is seeking to change. His temporary move to Africa will likely encompass an in-depth exploration of how to improve access to financial services and assets such as Bitcoin. According to the African Development Bank report, “Financial Inclusion in Africa,” the leading prohibitive factor in more robust financial infrastructure is inadequate access to financial services.The pieces to the puzzle for improving access are available, though. And it is precisely where Africa can break free of outdated systems like SWIFT and payment processors replete with trust issues and high fees. Blockchain firms focusing on instant, low-cost payments have subsequently swooped in at the opportunity to craft a new kind of financial infrastructure from its foundation. Payment systems relying on blockchains can bypass conventional obstacles, embedding themselves directly into the hands of Africa’s more than 456 million mobile users. Should Square Crypto expand its operations to cover the populous regions of Africa that Dorsey has hinted as the first in line for Bitcoin development (such as Nigeria), then direct access to Bitcoin investing, Square Crypto, and payment rails will be at the fingertips of more than 350 million unbanked adults. Related: Africa Using Blockchain to Drive Change: Nigeria and Kenya, Part OneRecent research indicates that Nigerians are willing to take drastic discounts on Bitcoin purchases using the Paxful exchange primarily to circumvent remittance services like Western Union and the restrictive banking infrastructure in Nigeria. Using gift cards and Bitcoin, users can diminish remittance times and avoid capital controls. According to researcher Matt Ahlborg: “The entire remittance process can be completed in 20–30 minutes with the end result of local Nigerian currency arriving to the family member’s bank account.”The property rights afforded by Bitcoin could also have an outsized impact on long-term economic repercussions, unlocking trillions in dead capital. More capital leads to more infrastructure investment, which becomes a positive feedback loop for the broader African economy. And some of that capital is already making its way into major infrastructure projects. One of the most high-profile infrastructure developments of 2019 came out of South Africa, where Meridian Economics proposed an $11 billion green energy initiative in the African nation. Funded by development finance and private institutions, the massive project’s undertaking would include lending money to the Eksom state utility provider on the condition that it increases the pace of coal plant closures and injects cash into renewables research and development. Related: South Africa: The Next Frontier for Crypto ExchangesThe move coincides with a growing influence by China in Eastern Africa, which has been pouring money into building transportation and energy infrastructure. Today, China is the largest financier of Africa’s infrastructure. The takeaway is that there is palpable interest in investing vast sums into Africa’s development, and blockchain technology is a common thread in many instances. For example, the President of China, Xi Jinping, detailed a planned push to improve and apply blockchain technology to practical uses in everything ranging from data sharing to industrial innovation. Although China’s position on renewables is still up for debate, the technological sentiment has been reflected in a flurry of projects implementing blockchain-based solutions that can make green energy sources a reality. For instance, Rolls Royce has invested 5 million euros ($5.6 million) into a blockchain-oriented Microgrid Validation Center that strives to reduce CO2 emissions, tinker with various microgrid models, and apply them to the real world. The initiative mirrors similar attempts to test the viability of microgrids in suburbs and cities, with the idea making its way into Africa. Energy demands in Africa far exceed supply, especially in countries like Nigeria. As a result, microgrids have become an increasingly appealing option for people who do not have access to main electrical grids, mostly living in rural areas, by using solar panels. Blockchains help to ease the transaction costs of such microgrid marketplaces, where people can buy and sell excess energy using mobile applications. But most of the marked shifts in Africa’s energy production will likely come from revamping primary electrical grids. Blockchains can help manage the excess waste of electricity, ease regulatory moats via more distributed systems, and create regional markets for the energy chain. For example, in the United Kingdom, EDF Energy and U.K. Power Reserve have already traded energy market capacity obligations on the Electron blockchain platform. In the context of Africa, governments can allocate renewable energy resources more efficiently, building national systems from the ground up with reduced costs. This overcomes one of the main issues with renewable energy sources — their high rates of energy curtailment. More efficient markets mean that less energy is accidentally (or deliberately) curtailed, making green energy ROI more appealing when compared with its fossil fuel counterparts. Both blockchain technology and Africa’s economic development may be in their nascent phases, but the opportunity is unmistakable. Blockchains can become a tool for the continent to bypass some of the inefficiencies plaguing the conventional financial system and collateral effects of the post-industrial revolution’s reliance on fossil fuels. The impact of blockchain on supply chains in primary industries like agriculture and mining will ultimately create a pan-African ecosystem of smart infrastructure. The efficiencies this creates will be further improved by AI-driven solutions and mesh networks of IoT applications. In turn, this will define the how, what, where of African infrastructure.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Chris Cleverly, a barrister by profession, has made it his mission to help bring development mechanisms to Africa which can empower Africans to seize their own destiny.

The exchange claims that users can complete a purchase in less than a minute and do not have to make deposits prior to a purchase.In the near future, Binance is planning to launch Mastercard support, as well as other currencies.Binance silently launched the ruble trading at the end of October 2019, initially allowing users to deposit and withdraw in Russia’s national currency on the platform. At the time Binance’s CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed that Russia was one of the top 10 markets on the exchange.Indeed, a survey by Russian-language crypto news outlet Forklog released last summer indicated that Binance was the most popular cryptocurrency exchange in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, with nearly 60% of respondents claiming that they prefer Binance rather than other global crypto exchanges.In December, Binance further extended trading capabilities for the Turksh lira and added a new trading pair for the lira and the ruble. Binance Turkey’s community manager told Cointelegraph that the exchange added order book trading for all of its Turkish lira trading pairs: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, Binance USD (BUSD), and Tether (USDT). Previously, these trading pairs had only been available as one-click buys or sells directly to and from the exchange.Recently, Binance launched peer-to-peer trading for the Vietnamese dong, enabling its users to directly purchase and sell major cryptocurrencies using dong through the latest versions of the Binance P2P mobile app on iOS and Android."

The company claims the product is the first sharded Proof-of-Work Layer 1 network to make it to market.As the launch completes Kadena’s hybrid blockchain platform, the fully functional hybrid blockchain enables the connection of a public chain with a private network, Kadena’s co-founder and president Stuart Popejoy said. He noted that the event is an important milestone in blockchain capabilities as the technology has a lot of limitations despite huge potential.Popejoy said:“Despite blockchain having immense potential, our experience building JP Morgan’s first blockchain showed us its limitations. Launching a fully functional hybrid blockchain which seamlessly integrates a public chain with a private network is a significant step forward in reimagining what applications can do on-chain.”Kadena’s hybrid blockchain supports interoperability using Pact, the firm’s open-source smart contract programing language. Martino noted that while Bitcoin’s (BTC) scalability challenges are being tackled with Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains, the security issues of the Ethereum blockchain are being addressed with Pact.Kadena Kuro, another component of Kadena’s hybrid blockchain platform that was formerly known as ScalableBFT, is the private blockchain launched on Amazon Web Services in January 2019.According to Kadena’s statement to Cointelegraph, Kadena’s hybrid blockchain can process 750 transactions per second, while Bitcoin and Ether are capable of processing just 7 and 15 transactions per second, respectively. Martino explained that Kadena is “intentionally starting small” with 10 chains, arming Kadena mainnet with “10 times the number of chains in a single network than any Layer 1 protocol ever seen before.” The transactions for all 10 chains are available for tracking on Kadena block explorer.According to the executive, Kadena has managed to address the core scaling issue, while keeping decentralization. Martino added that Kadena is expecting to expand the network to a larger scale in Q2 2020, noting that upgrading to 100 chains is likely. The Kadena co-founder also noted that if the firm would have launched with too many chains, people would not be able to realize the importance of Kadena’s innovation. He said:“If we had launched with 1000 chains, people wouldn’t be able to visually grasp the magnitude of the innovation that Kadena is bringing to market. We’ll be upgrading to a larger network for more scale in Q2, likely 100 chains, but for now, 10 chains provide and illustrate our unique value.”Led by JPMorgan blockchain veterans Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino, the Kadena network went live in early November 2019 as the firm announced a new $20 million token sale. At the time, Kadena launched its Chainweb mainnet alongside the Kadena token wallet Chainweaver.In an email to Cointelegraph, Kadena spokesperson clarified that the firm does not refer to its public chain as Chainweb anymore, simply calling it “Kadena public blockchain.” That is because the firm changed the product name to eventually refer to Chainweb as the underlying technology protocol of Kadena’s public blockchain, but not not the public blockchain product name.Launched in 2016, Kadena raised $15 million as of August 2019 in order to build a hybrid blockchain platform that outstrips smart contract blockchain solutions like the Ethereum blockchain and solves the PoW scalability issues of Bitcoin."

Despite that, throughout the past three years, the government of South Korea has opted against fully regulating the local crypto market.","In the second half of 2019, the government of South Korea started to work on several bills that would further legitimize the crypto sector and allow it to evolve into an established industry.Below is the complete timeline of the passing of bills and controversy surrounding the regulatory side of crypto in South Korea since 2017, and what is expected to come in the future. July 3, 2017:Park Yong-jin, a member of the National Policy Committee from the ruling Democratic Party, introduced the first-ever taxation policy for crypto. Park proposed the imposition of transfer tax, not capital gains tax, on cryptocurrency trading.July 31, 2017:Park Yong-jin introduced the Electronic Financial Transactions Act that was ultimately passed on Oct. 19, 2017, which covered cryptocurrencies. The regulatory framework tightened Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies around crypto.Sept. 1, 2017:The government of South Korea, in cooperation with the Financial Services Commission, established a task force to explore the transparency of cryptocurrencies and regulatory frameworks surrounding the asset class.Dec. 4, 2017:December 2017 was when controversy, uncertainty, and, therefore, the involvement of the South Korean government in regulating cryptocurrencies reached a peak.As a result, the Ministry of Justice revealed that it is forming a cryptocurrency regulation task force with the intent of implementing stricter guidelines for trading. The Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Financial Services Commission and several other agencies contributed to the task force.Dec. 11, 2017:As the Bitcoin (BTC) price started to see an explosive rally amid increasing speculation, the government started to hint at a full ban on cryptocurrency trading. Choi Jong-gu, the head of the Financial Services Commission, said in a press conference that the commission is looking into the possibility of imposing a comprehensive ban on crypto trading.Choi’s statement was the start to a highly controversial month for crypto and the government of South Korea. Different agencies and commissions were expressing a contrasting stance toward cryptocurrency regulation, and it led to the intervention from the Blue House, the official office of South Korea’s president.Jan. 11, 2018:Controversy and outrage regarding the government’s lack of direction in regulating the cryptocurrency market hit when former Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said that a bill to ban cryptocurrency exchanges was coming. He said that there is no difference in opinion between the Ministry of Justice and the Financial Services Commission.However, almost immediately after the statement of former Minister Park, the Blue House said that nothing is set in stone, essentially refuting the statement of Minister Park.Jan. 15, 2018:The government clarified that it does not plan to enforce a ban on cryptocurrency trading or exchanges. But it emphasized that it will tighten policy regarding market manipulation, money laundering and tax evasion.Jan. 16, 2018:In a State Council meeting led by President Moon Jae-in, the controversial statement of former Minister Park from a week prior was mentioned. The meeting concluded that Park’s statement was premature, and there was no formal agreement between the Ministry of Justice and the Financial Services Commission.Feb. 18, 2018:A seminar was conducted with members from the ruling Democratic Party (People’s First Party) and the opposing Liberty Korea Party to discuss cryptocurrency regulations. The attendees concluded that there is a clear need to lessen confusion around cryptocurrencies and to further evolve the blockchain space into a fast-growing industry.July 26, 2018:Since the formal establishment of a cryptocurrency task force in December 2017, no major progress or bills were proposed. It led to criticism from the media, cryptocurrency investors and companies that claimed the government was implementing a hands-off approach once again.Oct. 16, 2019:Fueled by growing regional initiatives from major cities like Seoul and Busan, the blockchain industry of South Korea started to see rapid growth.Specifically, describing blockchain as a key technology in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, South Korean Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki revealed the National Development Plan for Digital Trade. He cited blockchain as an important technology for the new initiative.Nov. 26, 2019:After almost a full year of silence from the government of South Korea, a new bill that would provide cryptocurrencies a legal foundation in the years to come was pushed forward. South Korea’s National Assembly’s national policy committee approved a bill that would allow cryptocurrencies to obtain legitimacy through transparency and stricter oversight.Dec. 9, 2019:The Ministry of Economy and Finance said that it plans to move forward with imposing taxes on cryptocurrency trading and is in the process of creating a bill for it. The National Assembly Budget Office said:“Income that is generated from businesses around cryptocurrency trading facilitation, payments processing, and mining can be taxed as business income tax or corporate tax. It is also viable to tax profits from trading cryptocurrency as transfer tax so there is a necessity to change tax laws appropriately.”Dec. 30, 2019:The local media criticized the controversial move of the National Tax Service when it hit Bithumb crypto exchange with a whopping $70 million bill for trades it facilitated for foreign users before the ban on foreigners trading cryptocurrencies in South Korea was imposed by the government.Hankyung, a mainstream business publication, said the government first has to provide standards for cryptocurrency taxation before going after companies and individuals.Based on media reports and the comments of industry executives as well as cryptocurrency investors, the past three years have been frustrating for almost everyone in the local cryptocurrency exchange market.Two top exchanges — Bithumb and UPbit — were hacked; progress on crypto regulation by the government lagged; and volume across the board fell quite substantially. Moreover, the government has not made clear steps on regulation for three years, and it is only in 2020 that major areas such as taxation are being addressed.Throughout the past six months, it has been evident that the government of South Korea has been generally following the direction on Anti-Money Laundering procedures set forth by the Financial Action Task Force, a financial watchdog under the G-7.With the government’s existing focus on money laundering prevention, which has been addressed extensively by the adoption of FATF’s guidelines by South Korea, companies and individuals can expect a standardization of taxation policies in 2020.Taxes around crypto and a framework for the National Tax Service to collect taxes with a clear legal basis are likely to be the main narrative of cryptocurrency regulation in South Korea over the next two years. An executive of South Korea-based crypto platform Tokeny, Heslin Kim, told Cointelegraph:“Thus far, we’ve seen Korean legislators benchmarking other countries for their crypto regulation. Japan has announced they will have their diet fully passed by March/April, and I would assume Korea will wait to see what Japan does before finalizing any decisions. There have been announcements of pending regulation since November 2017, and we have yet to see anything passed. I would not be surprised if we did not see anything passed until at least Q3–Q4 2020.”For most activities regarding cryptocurrencies such as trading, the government has been relatively lenient, even with the ruling Democratic Party’s cautious stance toward crypto regulation. The opposing Liberty Korea Party has consistently demonstrated a pro-crypto stance and, as such, no big shifts in the government stance are likely to be shown in the years to come.Despite controversial statements in the past regarding a ban on cryptocurrency trading, since 2018, crypto exchanges have been allowed to operate with relative stability in their operations. Major banks, like Shinhan and Nonghyup, have provided virtual banking accounts to top exchanges such as UPbit and Bithumb. Thus, the most widely utilized crypto exchanges in South Korea do not and have not suffered from a lack of banking service support.Strengthening AML requirements could be a bigger burden for exchanges in the short-term, but top exchanges have been proactive in preventing money laundering since major hacking attacks hit the local market in early 2018. On the matter, Kim added:“Tightening KYC/AML requirements has not impacted the exchanges as much as the banking restrictions that were put in place in early 2018. There are now only a few major exchanges with fiat off ramps, and this was one of the biggest reasons the Korean market was slowed so heavily. The market is rather stable now, but volume is still poor.” UPbit, Bithumb and others created a hotline in place to prevent hacked funds or suspicious transactions from exiting exchanges to ensure that the government and cybersecurity agencies can carry out comprehensive investigations.UPbit, in particular, went as far as to proactively delist privacy cryptocurrencies on its platforms after the Japanese government required local trading platforms to delist Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC) and Dash (DASH).Large-scale exchanges like UPbit and Gopax also have dominant, multi-billion-dollar conglomerates such as Dunamu-Kakao and Shinhan Bank as either investors or parent companies, which further legitimizes the local cryptocurrency exchange market."

The index also draws data from crypto index platform MVIS and major cryptocurrency data platform CryptoCompare.The dedicated website explains that the index is meant to cover global crypto markets in U.S. dollars and Japanese yen by tracking the largest cryptocurrencies. The index was designed for Japanese institutional investors with consideration for local availability and custody solutions.The NRI/IU Crypto-Asset Index is rebalanced monthly and tracks the performance of a pre-defined basket of crypto assets and will be tradable in dollars and yen on NRI’s platform. The index includes Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and XRP. IU CEO Akihiro Niimi commented on the launch:“Strong demand from institutional investors is contributing to the growth of crypto-asset funds, and well-diversified products like index funds are attractive as alternative investments.”Backtested performance statistics shown on the website claim that the year-to-date performance is 33.91%, the one-year performance is 104.86% and the three-year return is 2,211.26%. NRI is an affiliate of Japanese financial services giant Nomura Holdings, which has embraced blockchain technology and offers several services related to crypto assets. In October 2019, Nomura Holdings and popular Japanese messaging app Line announced a final capital alliance agreement focused on blockchain technology. In May 2018, Nomura rolled out cryptocurrency custodial services at its banks. The custody service aimed to address a perceived shortage of “safekeeping solutions” which were preventing traditional asset managers from building investment vehicles in the crypto ecosystem, according to Nomura. As cryptocurrencies become ever-more-widely recognized as an asset class, an increasing number of firms are developing derivatives giving exposure to their price fluctuations. As Cointelegraph reported last week, Swiss cryptocurrency financial firm Amun AG launched an exchange-traded product giving investors inverse exposure to Bitcoin on leading Swiss Exchange SIX.Still, while many claim that there is a clear demand for cryptocurrency derivatives, recent statistics may show otherwise. As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, little more than a month after their launch, Bitcoin options contracts on the Intercontinental Exchange’s digital asset platform Bakkt appear to have seen sluggish uptake, with no new trades occurring over the past 11 days."
