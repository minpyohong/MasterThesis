Bitcoins, I pulled together this complete beginner's guide to Bitcoin.","Jan 17, 2018,12:38am EST","When you dig into the details of Bitcoin, it’s almost an unbelievable tale about how to create money. Although it seems like fiction, it’s actually the best-known version of digital currency in use today. To help you wrap your head around what it is, what it does and how to earn Bitcoins, I pulled together this complete beginner’s guide to Bitcoin.","Adobe StockBefore we go any further I just want to reiterate that investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.A bit of bitcoin historyBitcoin was the first established cryptocurrency—a digital asset that is secured with cryptography and can be exchanged like currency. Other versions of cryptocurrency had been launched but never fully developed when Bitcoin became available to the public in 2009. The anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto—possibly an individual or a group whose real identity is still unknown—is behind the development of Bitcoin who stated the goal of the technology was to create “a new electronic cash system” that was “completely decentralized with no server or central authority.” In 2010, someone decided to sell their Bitcoins for the first time to purchase two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins. I hope the pizza was good, because if that person would have held onto those Bitcoins, they would be worth more than $100 million today. In 2011, Nakamoto shared the source code and domains with the Bitcoin community and hasn’t been heard from again.What is Bitcoin, really?Bitcoin is a digital currency, so there are no coins to mint or bills to print. There is not a government, financial institution or any other authority that controls it, so it’s decentralized. The owners who have Bitcoins in the system are anonymous—there are no account numbers, names, social security numbers or any other identifying features that connect Bitcoins to its owners. Bitcoin uses blockchain technology and encryption keys to connect buyers and sellers. And, just like diamonds or gold, a Bitcoin gets “mined.”How do you “mine” Bitcoins?People—or more accurately extremely powerful, energy-intense computers—“mine” Bitcoins to make more of them. There are currently about 16 million Bitcoins in existence, and that leaves only 5 more million available to mine because Bitcoins developers capped the quantity to 21 million. Ultimately, each Bitcoin can be divided into smaller parts with the smallest fraction being one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin called a “Satoshi,” after the founder Nakamoto. The mining process involves computers solving an extremely challenging mathematical problem that progressively gets harder over time. Every time a problem is solved, one block of the Bitcoin is processed and the miner gets a new Bitcoin. A user establishes a Bitcoin address to receive the Bitcoins they mine; sort of like a virtual mailbox with a string of 27-34 numbers and letters. Unlike a mailbox, the user’s identity isn’t attached to it.How are Bitcoins used?In addition to mining Bitcoins, there are other ways to earn Bitcoins. First, you can accept Bitcoins as a means of payment for goods or services. Setting up your Bitcoin wallet is a simple as setting up a PayPal account and it’s the way you store, keep track of and spend your digital money. They are free and available through a provider such as Coinbase. While this might take more time than it’s worth, there are websites that will pay you in Bitcoins for completing certain tasks. Once you’ve earned Bitcoins, there are ways to lend them out and earn interest. There are even ways to earn Bitcoins through trading and recently Bitcoin futures were launched as a legitimate asset class. In addition, you can trade your regular currency for Bitcoins at Bitcoin exchanges, the largest one being Japan-based Mt. Gox that handles 70 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. There are more than 100,000 merchants who accept Bitcoin for payment for everything from gift cards to pizza and even Overstock.com accepts it.What are the risks?There’s risk as well as a great opportunity with Bitcoin. While it has been appealing to criminals due to its anonymity and lack of regulation, there are lots of benefits to all of us if you’re willing to accept some risk to jump into the Bitcoin marketplace. Since there is no governing body, it can be difficult to resolve issues if Bitcoins get stolen or lost. In 2014 Mt. Gox went offline, and 850,000 Bitcoins were never recovered. Once a transaction hits the blockchain it’s final. Since Bitcoin is relatively new, there are still a lot of unknowns and its value is very volatile and can change significantly daily.So, the jury’s still out if Bitcoin will accomplish what its proponents predict, the replacement of government-controlled, centralized money. I fully expect 2018 to give us even more insight about the future of Bitcoin as the technology continues to grow and mature."

I know that you can’t really compare a digital currency to a company but it gives some perspective.Also, before we go any further I just want to reiterate that investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.While to many Bitcoin and Ethereum are both simply examples of cryptocurrencies – digital money transfer systems which use blockchain technology and encryption – there are subtle differences in how they work and what they can be used for.If you are looking to invest for speculative reasons, or even more so if you are considering using either platform for business – it’s important to understand those differences, because they could be the deciding factor in which coin (if either) goes on to become a widely accepted standard, and which will disappear into obscurity and worthlessness.What is a cryptocurrency?So, starting with the basics – cryptocurrency is a term that has come to be used to identify a newly emerging asset class. In some ways it is a slight misnomer – currencies are stores of value which we can use to purchase goods or services, and most cryptocurrencies cannot yet be exchanged for anything, other than other cryptocurrencies.So, while not currencies in the strict sense – they are certainly assets, as they hold value and can be sold for dollars, pounds and euros. Much like gold – which not everyone will accept in trade, but everyone agrees has a value.Unlike gold, however, cryptocurrency exists only in the digital world. So, how can we trust it is real?Well, basically, cryptocurrency stores value via mathematics. A simplified way of looking at it is that each cryptocurrency (and there are over 1,000 of them) is a very complex algorithm. The output of each algorithm tells us who owns each unit of that particular cryptocurrency – and is known as a blockchain.Bitcoin was the first success at creating a blockchain-based currency (or asset) which beat the double-spend problem inherent with digital assets. Digital data can be replicated and distributed indefinitely – so how do you stop people simply “copy and pasting” themselves more money?It overcame this issue in two ways – encryption, and distribution. The use of public and private key encryption means that although all the transactions on the network are public (essential for verification purposes), only those with permission can edit the data on the parts of the blockchain where they are authorized to do so.Simultaneously, its distributed nature – the fact that the blockchain algorithm is running on not just one, but potentially millions of machines – means that consensus must be established before updates to the blockchain are accepted across the wider network.In other words, if I take the data representing my five bitcoins and copy and paste it to give myself 10 bitcoins, it won’t work – because the changes I have made to my local blockchain will be rejected by the network consensus which knows (as I don’t have the correct private keys) that I don’t have ownership of those five extra bitcoins.How are Bitcoin and Ethereum different?Bitcoin was the first true cryptocurrency and has been in circulation since 2009. Ethereum is a far more recent development, going live in 2015.In the time between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s release, lots of other cryptocurrencies emerged. Mostly, however, they were limited to trying to improve on aspects of Bitcoin’s performance – for example, increasing speed of transactions or improving the security or anonymity of transactions.Ethereum is certainly faster than Bitcoin – with transactions typically settling in seconds, rather than minutes. But it also takes things further. While still blockchain based, and operating as a store of value, its fans and evangelists see it as a platform for distributed computing, which comes with its own built-in currency, called Ether.While the Bitcoin blockchain can simply be pictured as a database of accounts (or wallets) with an amount of currency stored in each, the Ethereum network blockchain is a more sophisticated construction, capable of storing computer code – applications – that can use the CPU power going into the network to execute.The currency – Ether – represents this CPU power – so the idea is that Ether will be bought and sold by businesses, governments or individuals to allow them to tap into the vast, distributed resources of the Ethereum network to run their own apps.The first of these applications are known as “smart contracts”. This is a way of automating contracts and agreements so they will execute when consensus says that conditions have been filled. Though simple, their uses are potentially widespread – such as enabling payment systems which will release funds on completion of work, or authorizing the transfer of ownership of good when payment has been made.The Ethereum network also allows the creation of other cryptocurrencies, or tokens, using the same protocol as Ether but distributed on different blockchains, which can be public or private. This means they can be created by organizations to represent shares, voting rights or as means of proving identity or authorization credentials.Should I invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum?Well, as I am not a financial advisor I wouldn’t tell you where to put your money. What I can do is suggest some things that you should bear in mind, if you are looking to make speculative investments in cryptocurrency.Ultimately, the long-term growth of any cryptocurrency (or indeed business) depends on useful applications being found for its assets.If Bitcoin goes on to become a widely accepted form of currency, or the Ethereum network becomes an established standard for distributed computing, then the value of these assets is likely to continue to grow.On the other hand, in technology, there is always something snapping at the heels of the front-runners. Newer and more efficient algorithms could replace either Bitcoin or Ethereum.Additionally, both face the threat of government regulation. The value of many cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) have moved downwards since the start of the year, which has been attributed to threats of their trade being regulated by governments in China and Korea.What is clear is that the huge increases in value we have seen over the last five years has largely been due to speculative investment – people buying them in the hope that they will be able to sell them for more money to someone else in the future.This is often a recipe for inflated prices and an inevitable crash back down to earth – something that many believe could happen at any time and may have already started.Ultimately, achieving sustainable growth will be dependent on useful applications. More businesses accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment, and more applications becoming widely used and supported on the Ethereum network."

Cryptocurrencies ...","Jan 16, 2018,11:48am EST","Bitcoin continues on its roller coaster ride falling from a high of $19,870.62 on December 17 to around $12,000 this morning. Cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin more than caught the attention of investors in 2017 when they became infatuated with it. Bitcoin started 2017 at $963.38 and ended at $13,850.40 for a gain of 1,338%. It nearly reached $20,000, coming close at $19,870.62 on December 17. This has led to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies getting huge media exposure and the creation of thousands of new ones. (Note for this article I’ve abbreviated cryptocurrencies as CCs.)","[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]A visual representation of the digital cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThere are many reasons that Bitcoin and CCs could increase or fall in value but the underlying reasons should be supply and demand. I wrote an article with 9 reasons that Bitcoin’s price could rise to $100,000 or more. However since Bitcoin and the other CCs are in a nascent stage, I believe there are at least 12 reasons that Bitcoin could fall back to $1,000. It was not even a year ago, March 26, 2017, to be exact that it traded for under $1,000. To get a handle on what could drive the price of Bitcoin significantly lower I’ve outlined the reasons below.#1) Regulation could have the biggest impactRegulators could have the biggest impact on Bitcoin and CC prices as multiple countries have either implemented some regulations or have discussed plans to limit them. If the regulations become too burdensome they could negatively impact the usage and therefore price of CCs.South KoreaSouth Korea has implemented some regulations and is considering additional ones. A few days ago it announced that CC traders would be fined if they do not convert from virtual accounts where they could trade anonymously to real-name accounts.One indication on how much regulations could impact a CCs price is when South Korea’s Ministry of Justice issued a premature statement on banning CC trading. After the statement was corrected the price of EOS, a popular CC in South Korea, jumped 40%.JapanJapan started to regulate Bitcoin and other CCs after Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin trading platform, collapsed and went out of business in 2014. It also passed legislation last year that legalized Bitcoin and other CCs as legal currency and an asset. These were positive steps in helping them become more mainstream but as with any legislation additional rules could be put in place to hurt them.ChinaThere is a Reuters article this morning saying “authorities should ban centralized trading of virtual currencies as well as individuals and businesses that provide related services.” This would be in addition to the country’s ban on ICOs or Initial Coin Offerings, CC trading exchanges and limits on Bitcoin mining.U.S. regulationThe SEC Chairman released a statement last month on “Cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings.” It laid out where the market is currently (wide open so investors should be very careful), what questions an investor could ask and that the SEC is very interested in this new technology.The U.S. Senate is planning on meeting with the SEC Chairman and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or CFTC Chairman next month. While I wouldn’t expect much to come from the discussion, at least initially it could bring CCs more into the regulatory framework.The challenge with many of the current and potential regulations is that even though one or multiple countries could ban trading or exchanges it doesn’t necessarily keep investors from executing trades in another country.#2) There is no “value” to itBitcoin or CCs don’t generate revenues or profits in the traditional sense. Miners do create revenue for themselves and traders charge a commission but a Bitcoin doesn’t do anything. There isn’t a physical presence to it (pictures such as the one at the beginning of this article are just representations) as it and other CCs are bits in computers.Since it doesn’t generate profits or cash it can’t be valued in ways that most other assets are. While a commodity such as gold can be used to create something of value, a Bitcoin resides in a computer. If enough uses aren’t eventually developed for them their demand could decrease.#3) Volatility can create nervousness Goldman Sachs has a chart that shows the daily volatility of Bitcoin vs. other investments such as WTI (West Texas Intermediate or oil), Gold, the S&P 500 and a few others. Bitcoin has been much more volatile than any of the other assets. This is good for traders (as long as they know what they are doing) but is mentally tough for longer-term investors. If this continues I believe it dampens demand from a wide range of investors.Bitcoin volatility#4) Leverage can be very badThe CBOE, or Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the CME Group started to make a market in Bitcoin options last December. These can be leveraged investments where only 44% of the total value needs to be covered. While the 44% is higher — too much higher — than other future contracts, given the volatility and risks involved it makes sense. However if Bitcoin’s price moves too much it could force contract holders to liquidate, putting more pressure on Bitcoin’s price.#5) A shakeout is comingThere were 1,450 CCs listed on coinmarketcap.com as of Tuesday morning with over half of them having a market cap under $10 million (note that Bitcoin’s was over $200 billion even with the price down to $12,300).There may be some legitimate uses for the “smaller” CCs but I suspect that hundreds of them will disappear. This would in theory decrease the supply of CCs which could mean investors may move their money to other CCs. Or the investments could be wiped out and the stain of so many going under would decrease demand.#6) ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings)The rapid increase in Bitcoin’s price has led to hundreds of ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings, launching in the past few months. Dentacoin was launched in August last year for the dental industry. The value of all its coins spiked to $2 billion last week and has fallen to $600 million.While Dentacoin may be legimate and survive, there are also instances of what appear to be outright fraud. The SEC has warned about ICO fraud, and this CNN article describes three potential ones. While there aren’t any assets behind Bitcoin or other well-known cryptocurrencies, a huge percentage of the new ICOs really could be all fluff. If too many ICOs are fraudulent this will hurt investor demand for CCs in general.#7) Hacking theft of CCsProbably the most well-known and largest theft of Bitcoins was Mt. Gox, a Bitcoin exchange in Japan. It was handling over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions but was hacked in February 2014 and 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen. At the time they were valued at $450 million and would currently be worth about $10 billion.Just last month Youbit, a South Korean Bitcoin exchange, was hacked. Almost 4,000 Bitcoins or 17% of its assets, worth about $48 million, were stolen. A Reuters article said that all customers CC assets would be marked down by 25%. That isn’t very comforting to CC investors.#8) FOMO or Fear of missing outThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, has helped to create a lemming effect. Investors don’t want to miss out on the next big thing and to a degree also want bragging rights that they own Bitcoin.It was reported by CNBC that Coinbase, a CC exchange, had 11.7 million accounts in October last year compared to Schwab’s 10.6 million. It increased in November, adding 300,000 in one week to get to 13.3 million. If this isn’t a rush to participate, nothing is.However, this could turn on itself. If enough Bitcoin owners decide they want or need to get out the value of a Bitcoin could drop dramatically.#9) Bitcoin mining scamsFrom an article I read on 99bitcoins.com about Bitcoin mining, there was a section about scams. It said, “There is a new concept called “cloud mining.” This means that you do not buy a physical mining rig but rather rent computing power from a different company and get paid according to how much power you own. At first this sounds like a really good idea, since you don’t have all of the hassle of buying expensive equipment, storing it, cooling it, etc.”It went on to add, “However, when you do the math it seems that none of these cloud mining sites are profitable in the long run. Those that do seem profitable are usually scams that don’t even own any mining equipment, they are just elaborate Ponzi schemes.”It wouldn’t surprise me that this is true given all the hype around Bitcoins. If this burns too many people it helps to break down the trust in Bitcoin and CCs.#10) Becomes too associated with criminals and rogue statesOne of the reasons that governments are concerned about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is that they could and are being used by criminals and money launderers. It has also been speculated that countries such as North Korea and Russia will or have been using Bitcoin and CCs to circumvent sanctions.Since Bitcoin users can remain anonymous and can work from anywhere in the world, this could lead to an increase in demand for them at the margin. However, if governments are able to find a way to regulate them due to the above concerns then the demand would be lessened.#11) Third parties changing their mindsThere have been Bitcoin debit cards available from various providers. However, on January 5 it appears that Visa Europe told many of them to close their debit cards immediately due to being out of compliance with its regulations. While this was probably a very small market it is not a positive step in CCs becoming more broadly accepted.#12) Bitcoin & Blockchain movie looks a lot like dot-com in 1999Kodak and Long Island Ice Tea (now Long Blockchain Corp) are two companies that have recently changed their names or announced that they were creating cryptocurrencies or a digital currency platform. Both of them saw their stocks jump after they revealed they were getting into digital currencies.While Kodak’s initiatives potentially have some merit, Long Island Ice Tea’s is pretty much beyond the realm of any imagination. If too many other companies jump on the CC bandwagon, it feels very similar to the dot-com era in 1999. That movie didn’t end well.It all comes down to trustIn many ways the global financial system is based on trust between individuals, companies and governments. One thought to kick around is that we trust all the computer bits that show how many shares of a company we own, how much cash we have at the bank and the credit card charges and payments for the stuff we buy. To a large degree these are computer bits stored as various locations. Bitcoin and other CCs are similar in this respect. However, if the trust in CCs falls apart it will lead to a fall in their prices.Please feel free to check out my other Forbes articles, “9 Reasons Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Or More” and “3 Reasons To Not Get Excited About Seagate’s Investment In Ripple/XRP,” regarding digital currencies."

Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesThere are many reasons that CCs could increase or fall in value but the underlying reason will be supply and demand. To get a handle on what could drive the price of Bitcoin significantly higher, I’ve outlined nine reasons below. I’ve arbitrarily picked $100,000, as I’ve also heard that it could go to $1 million, but I suspect that is to get media attention.#1) Limited to 21 million BitcoinsAt most there will be 21 million Bitcoins (or there are supposed to only be 21 million) “mined” or created. The first one was mined on January 3, 2009 and there are currently about 16.8 million in “circulation.”As you can see from the logarithmic chart below, it is becoming harder to create additional Bitcoins. Having it be harder to mine, along with a limit on how many can be created, makes the supply side come into play.Number of Bitcoins in circulation#2) First mover, network effect and media exposureWhat is unique to Bitcoin vs. other CCs is that it was the first one invented, gained acceptance by investors and businesses and has received the most media attention. New companies have formed to support and trade it, which has led others to take notice and try and cash in on the hype.Since there isn’t anything physically attributable to Bitcoin, having these qualities has been a huge help for it to gain traction. I am counting these three as one reason as they have a synergistic effect on each other and help create demand.#3) FOMO or Fear of missing outThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, has helped to create a lemming effect. Investors don’t want to miss out on the next big thing and to a degree also want bragging rights that they own Bitcoin.It was reported by CNBC that Coinbase, a CC exchange, had 11.7 million accounts in October last year compared to Schwab’s 10.6 million. It increased in November adding 300,000 in one week to get to 13.3 million. If this isn’t a rush to participate nothing is.#4) Lost keys   People lose and misplace things they own and amazingly enough it also happens with CC keys. While CCs are secure if the owner loses, misplaces or sometimes donates the computer device that has the CC key it is probably lost forever. Kimberly Grauer, Chief Economist at Chainalysis, estimates that 23% of CC keys have been lost which lowers the supply.#5) Large investment firms lend credibilityThe CBOE or Chicago Board Options Exchange and the CME Group started to make a market in Bitcoin options last December. Fidelity announced that besides making small investments in CC companies it also had a small mining operation. When you add reports that Goldman Sachs could start trading CCs it makes investors feel more comfortable committing capital and create demand. These large financial institutions wouldn’t be putting resources and people into CCs if they didn’t feel they weren’t viable.#6) Harder and costlier to mine themBitcoin mining was set up so that as more are created it becomes harder to produce the next one. And since mining is accomplished solely by computers it is taking more compute power to create them. This leads to higher system and energy costs.CNBC had a television segment last week showing a very large mining operation in Washington state where electricity costs are very low. The cost to create a new Bitcoin was about $3,500 so with a price that is $10,000 higher it is very profitable to do so. If mining costs increase it could slow down how fast new Bitcoins are created which would put a damper on its short-term supply.#7) HoardingHoarding of Bitcoins could occur as their owners expect their value to increase. While this could limit the supply of Bitcoins this can occur with any asset. At some price owners will decide to part with them.#8) Safety currencyThe U.S. dollar is considered the “safest” currency in the world since it has the full faith and support of the U.S. government. That being said there are a number of people and I suspect a growing number that look to Bitcoin and other CCs as a safe haven in times of trouble. Bitcoin has started to gain traction with people who live or send money to countries whose governments they don’t trust such as Zimbabwe or where inflation is very high, for example Venezuela.#9) Illegal activitiesUnfortunately Bitcoin and other CCs have been, and I believe, will continue to be used for illegal activities. Since Bitcoin users can remain anonymous and can work from anywhere in the world, this could lead to an increase in demand for them least at the margin.Will this continue?As with most assets there is no definite answer and especially with such a new and unique one. One thought to kick around is that we trust the computer bits that show how many shares of a company we own, how much cash we have at the bank and the credit card charges and payments for the stuff we buy. To a large degree, these are computer bits stored as various locations. Bitcoin and other CCs are similar in this respect.Bitcoin price chartYou can check out my other Forbes articles, “3 Reasons To Not Get Excited About Seagate’s Investment In Ripple/XRP” and “Kodak And Long Island Ice Tea Embracing Blockchain Is Just Like Dot Com In 1999.

forgot that the hard drive contained the codes to access some Bitcoins ...","Jan 29, 2018,11:10am EST",Shutterstock,"Somewhere in the Newport, Wales garbage dump is a computer hard drive that local resident James Howells discarded in 2013. He had spilled lemonade on it and thought it wasn’t worth fixing.Howells forgot that the hard drive contained the codes to access some Bitcoins he had “mined” beginning back in 2009. He had about 7,500 bitcoins, worth $75 million assuming a $10,000 bitcoin price.Howells naturally wants to recover the lost device. He’s offered the Newport council 10% of the proceeds if it will let him dig into the landfill. So far the answer is “no.”Stories like Howells’ are popping up everywhere. People who mined or purchased bitcoins, sometimes years ago, can’t access them.The reasons vary, but whatever happened, a lot of value is missing as Bitcoin’s price zooms higher.And these individual owners are only the first level. The accumulated pile of inaccessible bitcoins could lead to systemic consequences.Bitcoin’s anonymous inventor(s), Satoshi Nakamoto, designed the program to allow mining of only 21 million bitcoins by the year 2140. Miners have dug up about 17 million Bitcoins in total so far.A study last year by digital forensics firm Chainalysis estimated that somewhere between 2.78 million and 3.79 million Bitcoins are lost.That means as much as 22% of the existing Bitcoin supply might as well not exist. For all practical purposes, it’s gone.The real Bitcoin supply that is available for transactions isn’t 17 million — it’s 17 million minus those lost millions. So maybe as little as 13.21 million, using the higher Chainalysis estimate.Does that affect the Bitcoin price? It should.Imagine if these were shares of stock, and the company bought back two or three million of 17 million outstanding shares. The price would rise because supply dropped.But are the lost Bitcoins really lost? For some of them, we can’t be sure.“Satoshi” mined some 1 million initial Bitcoins.They’re on the blockchain ledger, so we know Satoshi hasn’t touched them. We don’t know who Satoshi is, whether he/she is still alive, or whether he/she still has access to those one million Bitcoins, or may have given access to others.Satoshi might even be a group of people.In any case, Satoshi’s stash represents 5.9% of existing Bitcoin supply. Their existence affects the value of all Bitcoins… but maybe it shouldn’t if a bus hit Satoshi and they are effectively gone.But Satoshi is/was pretty clever. Maybe some time-delay mechanism will distribute the one million bitcoins to Satoshi’s favorite people on a designated date. Or maybe Satoshi will retire and finally liquidate them next year. We can’t assume they are permanently gone.Similarly, many of those other “lost” Bitcoins may not remain so. Maybe that council in Wales will let Howells dig for his hard drive, and he’ll find it. If so, the total Bitcoin supply won’t change, but the available supply will rise.Or maybe scientists will invent brain-computer interfaces that let people recover forgotten passwords. Available Bitcoin supply will then grow some more.The law of supply and demand applies everywhere, even to Bitcoin. More Bitcoins in circulation means more bitcoins available when someone tries to buy Bitcoins with dollars, yen, gold or whatever.In theory, at least, that should have a bearish influence on the bitcoin price.Sound familiar? It’s what we would call “inflation” in a fiat currency. The value of each dollar drops as more dollars enter circulation.The broader point: Bitcoin has a kind of inflation risk.Granted, it’s less vulnerable than a fiat currency, thanks to that hard supply limit of 21 million. Central banks have no such limits. They can debase their currencies to nothing, as is happening in Venezuela right now.But just like monetary inflation, this risk grows with time. The longer people search for lost Bitcoins, the more likely they’ll find some. Technology will be giving them better tools as time passes, too.Bitcoin has many risks, so this is a relatively minor one. It’s small, but above zero.Small risks add up when trading stocks, bonds, or currencies. The traders who survive are the ones who watch for them.Bitcoin traders should take note."

[+] awareness of crypto-coins. (KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images)","Just a few years into the cryptocurrency revolution, bitcoin mining is already eating up an estimated 20,000 gigawatt hours of electricity per year. That’s roughly .1% of global generation, on par with the power demand of Ireland. The primary culprits are bitcoin mining appliances like the Antminer S9, which is a computer processor that does nothing but endlessly crunch algorithms to lengthen the blockchain. An Antminer draws a load of 1.5 kilowatts — enough to power two refrigerators and a flatscreen TV. If you run an Antminer 24/7 for a year it will produce about 0.85 bitcoins, at a cost of about 15,000 kilowatt hours. Depending on your power prices it will cost anywhere from $600 (at 3 cents per Kwh) to $1,800 (at 9 cents per Kwh) to mine one coin. Even with bitcoin having plunged to $11,600 this morning, there’s still money to be made, assuming you can get your machines cheap enough. Walmart sells the Antminer s9 for $8,200.But what happens if the bitcoin bubble just keeps expanding? Some naysayers worry that bitcoin mining could eat up all the world’s power generation by 2020. Is it a realistic concern? No. Analysts Michael Weinstein, Khanh Nguyen and their team at Credit Suisse took a look at the issue, and in a research note out today they conclude that fears of cryptocurrencies overwhelming the power grid are overblown. Start by comparing bitcoin’s 20,000 gigawatt hours per year with the 4.3 million Gwh used in the U.S. last year and 6 million by China. The analysts figured that if the price of bitcoin rose to $50,000, miners would find it economic to boost their efforts such that they would consume more than 350,000 Gwh, still less than 2% of world power capacity. The team also calculated the bitcoin price that would be needed to incentivize miners to gobble up all the world’s generation capacity: $1.1 million per coin.But that’s all assuming existing technology. As cryptocurrencies evolve, they will become more energy efficient. The proof-of-work algorithms run by bitcoin miners are needlessly complex. New coins have simpler algorithms. Ethereum is even shifting from a proof-of-work system to a more easily processed proof-of-stake system.Cryptomining will enjoy the same economies of scale of web servers. From 2000 to 2010 the power consumed by data centers surged from 20,000 Gwh to about 70,000 Gwh. Extrapolating that rate it wasn’t going to take long for the growth of the internet to outstrip human ability to keep the lights on. Yet data centers evolved to meet the need, growing in size and scale as well as energy efficiency. Since 2010 server farm power demand has barely grown, despite the number of installed servers growing sixfold. According to scientists at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, the industry is on track to improve energy efficiency 45% by 2020, with the likes of Google, Amazon and Facebook leading the charge.Fears of rampant energy usage caused by new marijuana cultivation were similarly half-baked. Utility companies in Colorado, California, Oregon and Washington have seen less than a 2% uptick in power demand linked to pot growing, according to the Credit Suisse team. Pacific Gas & Electric even offers discount power pricing for growers — who have LED bulb technology to thank for keeping their lighting bills low.There’s also the substitution effect. Crypto-blockchain-based payment systems will eventually replace our hack-prone credit card institutions, which themselves use massive data centers (Visa even has one with a moat). And somewhere out on the margin, cryptocurrencies are likely to reduce demand for other expensive-to-mine assets, like gold, which according to S&P Global has an all-in cash cost of about $900 per ounce.In the long run, says Credit Suisse, the breakthrough far more likely to rile world energy markets is the electric vehicle. If, by 2040, EVs grab a third of new-car market share, the world could require more than 280 gigawatts of additional power generation capacity — or somewhere in the vicinity of 2.4 million Gwh. But again, that’s figuring on current technology. After 25 years of improvements, lithium ion batteries are going to keep getting better.Technology has a way of outwitting the unbelievers. Just a few months ago Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, called bitcoin “stupid” and a “fraud.” Last week he said he regretted those comments, saying, “The blockchain is real.” "

backing ...","Jan 30, 2018,09:19am EST",Shutterstock,"Note: This is a follow-up to “3 Lies Bitcoin Skeptics Tell Themselves,” which was published earlier this month. I said I would write more on this topic if the first one did well, and nearly 75,000 views later, here I am.It seemed like last week was the week of the bitcoin skeptic as everyone from Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman to legendary investor George Soros had negative things to say about the world’s first and most well-known cryptoasset.Although the arguments against bitcoin keep coming, they haven’t evolved much since 2013, when the first major run-up in the price brought out all of the haters. With skepticism abound once again, I thought now would be a good time to cover three more lies bitcoin skeptics tell themselves.Lie #1: Bitcoin Has No “Intrinsic Value”and Will Crash to ZeroOne of the most common arguments against bitcoin is that the price will eventually crash to zero because there is no true, intrinsic value backing the asset.On the other hand, the skeptics say the U.S. dollar is required for tax payments, and even gold has the underlying utility of industrial use cases. This argument is so common that well-known economist Nouriel Roubini made it in a new article that I saw while writing this one.If the skeptics want to make this argument, then they need to come to grips with the fact that permissionless digital payments could also be construed as the underlying value of bitcoin. Much like you need U.S. dollars to make tax payments in the United States, you also need bitcoin to make permissionless, digital payments in an efficient manner online (gold bugs can also read this full breakdown of what they miss about bitcoin's intrinsic value).Chartalism is just basic appcoin ideology applied to government taxation. Both rely on friction to force hodling their token, but if that friction is technologically removed so to speak then the token value tends towards zero.— Pierre Rochard (@pierre_rochard) January 13, 2018Now, you could argue bitcoin is not required because there are so many altcoins that can also be used, but the issue there is that bitcoin is the most reliable, stable, secure, and long-lasting of all the cryptocurrencies, which is why people still prefer it in the face of high on-chain transaction fees (see my full explanation of why the bitcoin price has continued to rise in the face of higher transaction fees).This point about bitcoin lacking any “intrinsic value” has been used as the reasoning behind many of the nearly 250 times people have said bitcoin is dead.In addition to the contradiction in terms of a payments use case providing underling utility for U.S. dollars but not bitcoin, this argument sort of misses the fundamental value proposition of bitcoin in the first place — at least in terms of what drives its price. Bitcoin is a seizure-resistant digital asset with a transparent and incorruptible monetary policy, which provides the base, intrinsic (if you want to call it that) value proposition that attracts hodlers (see my full breakdown on hodlers providing a price floor for bitcoin).Now, this is not to say the bitcoin price could not be in a short-term price bubble; that’s certainly possible. However, a price correction would not indicate that there is no value here at all.Lie #2: Bitcoin Wastes Energy and Harms the EnvironmentAnother common argument made by bitcoin skeptics is that decentralized transaction processing is a bad idea due to the inefficiencies involved and the headline-grabbing energy costs that go into the mining process. Skeptics often say that this energy is “wasted” and does nothing but harm the planet because, as I’ve already covered, they also think Bitcoin is a useless system anyway.First of all, bitcoin mining is not wasteful by definition. Miners are incentivized to secure the network via rewards in the form of newly created bitcoin and transaction fees; therefore, miners only mine if people find bitcoin useful as a store of value and/or medium of exchange.Secondly, as Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh has argued, bitcoin incentivizes the discovery and advancement of renewable forms of energy.“The fact is that the Bitcoin protocol, right now, is providing a $200,000 bounty every 10 minutes (the bitcoin mining reward) to the person who can find the cheapest energy on the planet,” wrote Van Valkenburgh in a blog post last month.Over the past few months, we’ve seen energy providers in Washington state and Quebec receive more requests than they can handle from cryptocurrency miners who desire low-cost electricity for their facilities. What do these two locations have in common? Cheap, clean hydroelectric power.Lie #3: Bitcoin is a Bad Idea Because Bad People Might Use ItThis third lie (or sixth lie if you started with the previous article) that bitcoin skeptics tell themselves is usually made when any new form of technology first hits the market: What happens if bad people use it?While bitcoin is far from anonymous right now, it could eventually be made much more private. In fact, some altcoins, such as Monero and Zcash, already provide enhanced anonymity to those who seek it.When thinking about the issue of some people using bitcoin to do bad things, it’s important to think of what the alternative option implies. If there is no anonymity allowed in online transactions, then that means the national government and/or a handful of companies will know about everyone’s online purchasing habits. At this point, it should also be remembered that the world is becoming an increasingly cashless society.This argument that bad people will use bitcoin is similar to the arguments against encryption more generally. There is no grey area to deal with here. Privacy is binary; you either have it or you don’t.Government officials have long contended there is a need for backdoors in encryption software so law enforcement can more easily solve cases once they have probable cause. Others say that backdoors don’t work because they cannot be sufficiently secured from hackers. The most famous version of this debate — at least in recent times — came in the form of the FBI trying to get Apple to unlock a domestic terror suspect’s phone.Apple: If we're forced to build a tool to hack iPhones, someone will steal it.FBI: Nonsense.Russia: We just published NSA's hacking tools— Christopher Soghoian (@csoghoian) August 17, 2016Apple’s argument was that a backdoor in their phones would be nearly impossible to keep secure and out of the hands of hackers. Later in the same year, Apple’s point was illustrated when a set of hacking tools and exploits were stolen from the NSA.According to Wired, the FBI was eventually able to unlock the terror suspect’s phone without Apple’s help anway.So, in the context of bitcoin, the debate is between some centralized entity (likely a bank and/or government) knowing the financial activities of all of their users (and potentially leaking this data to hackers) and everyone having a right to financial privacy.One last thing to consider for lie numbers two and three is that bitcoin doesn’t much care how you feel on these points. Even if bitcoin were extremely wasteful and only useful for criminals, the system is designed to be resistant to government-enforced shutdowns. We’ll have to wait for a serious crackdown or attack from a major government (if it’s not already happening) to see how well this aspect of the system holds up."

When belief supersedes reason in finance, we call it speculation.","Is belief crowding out reason when it comes to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? While I think that blockchain technology is promising, I don't know if we should be betting on Bitcoin and other virtual currencies as if they're a new discovery of gold or silver deposits.Prof. Robert Shiller, who teaches economics at Yale and is an expert on bubbles and speculation, says we should pay close attention to the story behind Bitcoin. He claims it bears some huge similarities to the Wizard of Oz, which was really a veiled satire on the folly of the gold standard (the ""yellow-brick road"").Yale University professor Robert Shiller.(AP Photo/Jessica Hill)As someone who has carefully analyzed both the housing and dot.com bubbles - and won a Nobel Prize in economics for his research - Shiller has called the Bitcoin craze a bubble. This is what he told Quartz earlier this year:“I think that has to do with the motivating quality of the bitcoin story. And I think, what’s so exciting? You have to think like humanities people. What is this bitcoin story?”For one thing, millions believe that Bitcoin will make them rich with little or no effort. After all, the virtual currency's reference price has climbed more than 600% in recent months, although it's retrenched this month - off 50% from its peak value.Then there's the allure of blockchain technology: The government doesn't control it, computers around the world monitor it and it's embedded in cryptic code, so it would be hard to hack. So goes the story, although there are some strange aspects to it.When I saw Shiller speak recently, he elaborated when I asked him a question about Bitcoin. Shiller was lecturing at the Chicago Humanities Festival.I've seen Shiller several times in the past and have interviewed him for two of my books: The Cul-de-Sac Syndrome and Keynes's Way to Wealth.How do you value Bitcoin when there are no earnings, dividends or price/earnings ratios? I asked Prof. Shiller.While he didn't offer a direct reply on the valuation question, he gave me his observations on the story behind Bitcoin and why it's valued so highly.""Bitcoin is the best narrative possible,"" Shiller replied with a smile. ""It's a great story. It's a mystery based on a person who wrote a brilliant paper that nobody seems to have found (Satoshi Nakamoto).""""Who is this person? Maybe he doesn't exist. But when I'm lecturing at Yale, my students wake up when I talk about Bitcoin. I can see it in their eyes. I'm interested in the narrative.""For now, you'll also need to pay attention to the other parts of the Bitcoin story. It's unregulated, although government agencies are casting a gimlet eye on it. Big banks hate it. Drug dealers reportedly use it on the dark web. Transactions are really hard to trace, if at all.The CBOE and CME Group is offering derivatives that allow you to hedge or speculate based on the cryptocurrency's price.Certainly blockchain and Bitcoin and its many cousins aren't going away. But their popularity will hopefully not obscure the need for more transparency. I would refrain from adding them to your retirement plan until more is known.Then there's the underlying narrative. Every story has its ups and downs. Although I have no idea where Bitcoin will end up, keep in mind that all bubbles don't end well."

prices of “cryptocurrencies” still will depend on how much value ...","Jan 11, 2018,08:24am EST","I’ve only written about Bitcoin on this blog once before, four years ago. To me, it was a sideshow, although I admit that it’s underlying technology – blockchain – is rich with potential.","My opinion about Bitcoin – and now its johnny-come-lately imitators and competitors – remains largely unchanged. In accordance with Carl Menger’s subjective theory of value, the market prices of “cryptocurrencies” still will depend on how much value individuals choose to attach to it. Also, Bitcoin and the others still have the speculative potential to produce mind-boggling profits.On one crucial fundamental point, though, I now disagree with my earlier assessment of Bitcoin and its cousins: I no longer believe that one can legitimately call them “currencies.” That is a fallacy, a falsehood, or an inaccuracy, and I’ll let you debate the proper semantics. My point is this: The primary definition of a currency – “money” – is that it serves a society as the generally accepted, routinely used medium of exchange.  Neither Bitcoin nor any other so-called “cryptocurrency” does that or is capable of that in its current stage of development.Perhaps you have seen The Wall Street Journal video that vividly illustrates the defects that render Bitcoin impractical (at least for now) as a currency: The service charges for processing small transactions can nearly double the cost of an item purchased; the time it takes to process a transaction varies unpredictably, thereby making transactions cumbersome and inconvenient; and since few vendors use the real-time dollar-Bitcoin exchange ratio, the dollar price of a transaction may be far different from what one thinks one is paying. Yuck! (Note: North Korean agents and other hackers are showing that Bitcoin has other defects, such as not being as secure as advertised, but I am limiting my discussion to the defects that disqualify Bitcoin from being characterized as money.)Let’s look at Bitcoin from the perspective of Gresham’s Law, popularly but sloppily stated as, “Bad money drives out good money.” This seems to apply to Bitcoin, because few rational people would pay 76 Federal Reserve notes’ worth of Bitcoin for a pizza (as in the Journal’s video) when they can buy it for ten Federal Reserve Notes. Because of this, most Bitcoins have been withdrawn from everyday circulation.Actually, a better way of stating Gresham’s Law is that when something is more valuable in a nonmonetary market than it is as money, it will migrate to its nonmonetary market and cease to be used as money. Since Bitcoin has largely migrated from the monetary marketplace, it raises a key question: If Bitcoin isn’t money, then, what is it? Unlike gold and silver, which had centuries-long track records of being valued for various nonmonetary uses, Bitcoin has no preexisting nonmonetary uses. Neither does it have a track record that provides any reliable parameters for its exchange value.Bitcoin and the other cryptos have value for those seeking to move or store wealth outside the banking system and hopefully out of view from the prying eyes of government. And, like gold and silver, they have value for those who want insurance against the depreciation of government fiat currencies. It seems to me, though, that the primary demand for cryptos today comes from speculators. People desire and purchase Bitcoin and similar devices for the simple reason that the market price of Bitcoin has soared, and many people believe that it will soar more in the months and years ahead. For many of its holders today, Bitcoin amounts to a digital casino in which shrewd financial sharks will devour the wealth of naive novices and pathological gamblers.In accordance with the free-market axioms that the customer is always right, and that profit-seeking enterprises need to provide what people are demanding, the financial industry is scrambling to get on board the crypto train. Popular financial newsletter publishers are rushing new newsletters to market, dispensing advice on investing or speculating in cryptos. Likewise, financial institutions are making new markets for the trading of cryptos and derivatives thereof.Cryptos have become an investment mania reminiscent of the dot-com boom of the late ‘90s. Some think the recent parabolic rise in the price of Bitcoin signals the beginning of the end of a crazy bubble. While that is possible, the recent price spikes may instead mark the end of the beginning (the opening act in a long-term crypto drama). It is possible that the crypto mania will play out similarly to the dot-com craze, with many of the cryptos failing and becoming worthless while one or a few of the crypto competitors flourish. Just as many believed that there could be no longevity to a business that didn’t earn profits (Amazon in its early years) so today, many believe that a “currency” that doesn’t function like a currency can’t survive. I’m not so sure about that. As long as people continue to value Bitcoin for whatever reason – parking wealth outside official channels, insurance against pathetic fiat currencies, speculation, etc. – it will have value. And given the limited supply of Bitcoin, its market price, though subject to great volatility, may eventually enrich its holders and make its creator(s) (the individual or individuals pseudonymously known as “Satoshi Nakamoto”) to supplant Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the richest wealth-holder(s) in the world.To repeat my conclusion of four years ago: “What follows is going to be interesting. Good luck to all.” And be careful."

Past analyst/co-founder, on Quora:Let’s be clear about something: there is no such thing as a meaningful Bitcoin price prediction. It just isn’t possible with the current structure.
To explain:Simply put, trading is based on sentiment, without anything fundamental to act as an anchor. There is no true waterline, whatever small snapshots in time might suggest. Ignore the hundreds of hot-take explanations suggesting “well, the problem is that amateurs who don’t understand Bitcoin’s true value came in and pushed the price up above where it should have been”. This is the sort of nonsense that makes a bubble a bubble. The closest that Bitcoin has to a true value is: (i) its demand for use-cases where it’s the only medium of exchange for a given purpose (few of them legal or good), and (ii) the recovery cost of miners.Neither of those dynamics support a price at $10k or any other high number. They work just as well at $5k, or less.Being candid, trying to make sense of all the tangled signals involved is on the level of reading tea leaves. We might be right in our guesses, but we’re often right about a lot of things by accident (especially when we’re gambling on a binary outcome — it’s much easier to pick a single winner than say that of a multi-team tournament). The only sure thing is that volatility will remain high.Case in point, I made a gentleman’s wager in early December with two fellow Quorans that Bitcoin would break the $10k floor by year’s end (it was then trading at around $16k). Turns out I was off by two weeks (it fell to a low of $9,200 this morning). Does this make my prediction meaningful? Not really. It was a gut instinct. The price could just as easily have hit $25k and I wouldn’t have been terribly surprised. Hence why I only bet a latte.We have to be real about the limitations of knowledge here. Sure, it’s a fun thing to banter about, or to bet on with our spare cash. And, sure, we can make some logical predictions about how governments may act or how state-sponsored competitors may muddy the waters. What we can’t do is know for sure what will happen to prices in general. If someone says otherwise, they’re either trying to make a name for themselves or trying to take your money. Beware of both.Note: A previous version of this piece contained a mistake about the relationship between trading volumes and block sizes.

For instance, Morgan Stanley estimates it could outstrip power demand from electric vehicles by 2025.  Bitcoin mining currently thrives on cheap electricity from power plants which have lost customers, like hydropower and coal plants in China orphaned by reduced aluminum production, but on its current trajectory Bitcoin will require new power plants or compete with electricity consumers where miners have ready access to transmission.Bitcoin’s increasing exchange value drives energy consumption by increasing the so-called “network rate,” which is the number of computations or “hashes” per second competing to provide the next block in the Bitcoin block-chain, and hence the next allotment of Bitcoins.  Bitcoin value inflation has increased computations required per dollar (or other currency) of revenue to the point where computing power could make more money elsewhere (mining for other crypto-currencies like Ethereum, or even taking on cloud computing).Bitcoin Basics Push It into An Energy Demand “Red Zone” Stepping back to consider how Bitcoin works helps explain these effects of the crypto-currency phenomenon.  Bitcoin is a distributed encrypted ledger list consisting of data blocks (the blockchain), each about 1 megabyte in size.  To extend the blockchain, a miner (or a pool of miners) solves a difficult computation with computers.  The first one to crack a given problem gets to add the next block to the chain and collect revenues for processing transactions into that block; if validated they also get a fixed number of Bitcoins.  This is the “proof-of-work” scheme for allocating new Bitcoins.  Today that amount is 12.5 Bitcoins per block, but it gets halved every 210,000 blocks (this explains why only about 16 million Bitcoins will ever exist).  The Bitcoin code is set up to create about one block every ten minutes by adjusting the difficulty of mining as a function of the overall network rate.How the blockchain worksWith some Bitcoin basics understood, we can now understand the price/energy/hash rate dynamics underpinning this analysis.  First, let’s look at how the exchange value of a Bitcoin matches up with the network rate (measured in quadrillion hashes per second - TH/s).  Mining involves fixed costs, like computer hardware, and variable costs like the energy prices.  Bitcoin mining revenue must exceed electricity costs, and cover equipment purchases, along with a profit margin.  If Bitcoin value increases, so do profit margins from a fixed rate of mining, attracting new miners.  This can be slow if new equipment needs to be installed, or fast if existing equipment is diverted from other uses (like mining another proof-of-work crypto-currency).  New miners drive up network rates, and mining difficulty increases to maintain a fixed production schedule of a block per ten minutes.As hash raters increase, less efficient (in Joules per Hash) computers eventually can’t make enough revenue to cover energy expense and drop out, while newer more energy-efficient machines begin mining – able to target fatter profit margins.  Due to different levels of energy efficiency, and overall improvements in energy efficiency for mining, hash rates will tend to creep up anyways, but the main driver of increase is still the Bitcoin exchange value.  If that falls, less efficient computers will drop off sooner, newer more efficient computers will join more slowly, and some miners may choose to use their computing resources for other purposes.  Hence, we can expect a roughly linear relationship between network rates and Bitcoin value.  This is born out empirically in data, although today the growth in Bitcoin’s value is running ahead of the network rate, implying that we can expect the network rate and related energy consumption to rise soon (or that miners expect Bitcoins to drop below $7,000).The linear relationship between network rate (currently around 15 Million TH/s) and Bitcoin exchange value (currently dropping fast at around $11,000), combined with electricity use rising as a function of computational intensity, provides a mechanism for understanding why the explosive Bitcoin price growth to date has driven explosive energy use growth from mining – and Bitcoin’s movement into the “red zone” of rapidly increasing resource use.But details about hashing difficulty and the precise efficiency and computational power of various mining rigs obscure a simple tie between the Bitcoin exchange value and energy use from miners.  At any given moment blocks are being produced at roughly one every ten minutes (slightly faster if difficulty adjustments can’t quite keep up with network speed increases), a fixed number of Bitcoins is produced per block, and each Bitcoin can be traded at its exchange value.  This means the current Bitcoin value directly sets the amount of total available revenue from Bitcoin mining at a given time.Since electricity cost is an important part of mining cost, some fraction of revenues will always be directed towards paying electricity bills.  This fraction may vary from 5% to 95% for any given mining rig, but the mining fleet average will never vary by more than one order of magnitude from around 40%.  Similarly, we can assume average electricity prices around $0.05/kilowatt-hour with only some variation.  In summary, if the value of a Bitcoin multiplies sixteen times in one year and sustains growth, the associated energy consumption cannot be far behind.Bitcoin’s “Green Zone” Of Growth – 19% Per YearSo far, we have mostly seen how  sky-rocketing Bitcoin prices pushed the currency into a “red-zone” making the whole scheme more likely to crash than a tulip craze .The world's first bitcoin miners at work?Yet, the simple math connecting Bitcoin value with energy use highlights a “green zone” where investors in Bitcoin can see investment growth at up to 19% without driving unsustainable energy use from miners.  Since the number of Bitcoins allocated per block is halved roughly every four years by design, Bitcoin’s value can double every four years (or 19% growth) without increasing annual revenue and energy use.If Bitcoin’s bubble can survive the inevitable burst, there is no reason why it can’t offer investors attractive returns without driving crazy energy use.In fact, if Bitcoin mining can settle into a more stable growth pattern, it could become a net contributor to a more sustainable energy system by capturing orphaned energy value.  Today this mostly implies isolated power plants without sufficient transmission access, but once mining equipment is mostly paid and fixed costs are low, the equipment can shift to mining only when power prices are low.  This ready source of demand elasticity would provide valuable flexibility on a majority-clean power grid based on variable generation from sources like wind and solar.It’s hard for any rational observer to see the spectacular current rise in Bitcoin prices without anticipating some kind of major crash, or to look at the concurrent rise in energy consumption without some concern.  However, if crypto-currencies sustain interest after the inevitable bubble-burst, they will have plenty of room for stable growth without running into economic or energy consumption limits, and could improve our economy and our environment."

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis even indicated as much in an article last week.Whether the price will continue to rise in the aftermath of historic gains in 2017 is still up for debate, but there seems to be a stronger understanding that this cryptoasset will not simply vanish out of thin air one day.Having said that, there are still plenty of gold bugs and Nobel-prize winning economists who still don’t understand the value proposition of Bitcoin (I tried to explain it to the gold bugs here).With the creation of a new asset class comes the difficulty of assessing the fundamental, underlying value of these assets. While earnings reports can be used to calculate theoretically fair valuations of traditional stocks, no such data exists for Bitcoin. A number of different theories for valuing bitcoin and other cryptoassets have popped up over the past few years, but those who dare make price predictions based on some sort of traditional valuation analysis usually end up with egg on their face.#NeverForget #ProfessorBitcorn #Rekt pic.twitter.com/wmsOOhNdNu— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) December 5, 2017Of course, there is one theory that has been around for a number of years now that has been mostly overlooked. It is the theory that long-term holders have the biggest impact on the Bitcoin price and transactional demand is not nearly as important.There was a whole paper published on this topic in early 2014, although the concept was laid out in a theoretical manner rather than proven with empirical evidence. The basic idea is that the bitcoin price in terms of U.S. dollars or any other fiat currency will be determined by the willingness of holders to pull bitcoin out of circulation more than anything else.To gain a better understanding of this theory, one must look deep into the mind of the hodler.What is a Hodler?No, “hodler” is not a typo, and it doesn’t stand for “holding on for dear life.”Hodl is a meme that originated in a drunken post on the Bitcointalk.org forum back in late 2013 as the bitcoin price was collapsing amid regulation-related concerns in China.The original post indicated a preference for long-term holding of the bitcoin asset as opposed to day trading, but the meme has grown into a rallying cry for bitcoin holders who are willing to hold on to their bitcoin in pretty much any market environment.The hodlers are here to stay, and they’re not leaving. They’re the strong hands that do not sell when the price collapses by 25% in a single day or 50% over the course of a month. In fact, they buy the dips.Why Do Holders Hodl?Hodlers take their belief in the use of Bitcoin as a store of value to religious levels. Some of them hodl for political reasons (they would prefer to see the world use Bitcoin as money rather than the U.S. dollar or any other fiat currency), others just want to speculate on the future usefulness of bitcoin as a widely-used form of money.In short, hodlers hodl because they believe in the meme of bitcoin as digital gold. They understand the value of a permissionless, censorship-resistant form of electronic money in an increasingly digital world.In other words, hodlers are the floor on the bitcoin price. Once enough people sell their bitcoin, only the hodlers are left, and they’re ready to buy more, which increases the percentage of the total supply of bitcoin that is held by the hodlers.A true hodler will never sell their bitcoin. Instead, the hodler waits patiently for the day when the use of Bitcoin is ubiquitous around the world and their everyday transactions can be made via the permissionless digital cash system. As the infamous meme based on a scene from The Matrix says, hodlers won't have to sell by the time they're ready to cash out.As longtime hodler and PayPal Board Member Wences Casares recently indicated, the idea here is that Bitcoin will eventually become a global, apolitical standard for value and settlement.Can Hodling Be Measured?Bitcoin hodlers have the strongest effect on the long-term bitcoin price, but is there any way to measure their collective impact? Not really.The key issue here is hodlers can be hard to detect on the blockchain. It’s not clear if someone is a real hodler until they’ve gone through a price panic or two.FundStrat co-founder Tom Lee uses a combination of the total number of Bitcoin addresses and the average dollar-value transaction volume between those addresses as a way of tracking the overall Bitcoin userbase. But again, not all Bitcoin users are hodlers.Sure, there was a LendEDU survey released last year that indicated the average price holders would sell at was nearly $200,000 per Bitcoin, but these were holders, not necessarily hodlers. It’s possible that many of the individuals who participated in the survey sold their bitcoin during one of the sharp price drops over the past month. Price crashes tend to separate the holders from the hodlers.Every short-term Bitcoin price bubble brings new attention to the bitcoin asset, with some of those new users having the potential to turn into hodlers. Instead of looking for data points that can be used to predict daily movements in the bitcoin price, perhaps those who are interested in the future potential here should take the advice of a drunken bitcoin believer from 2013 and simply hodl."

[+] (ANTHONY WALLACE/AFP/Getty Images)","China’s government is planning to shut down Bitcoin miners in its latest crackdown on the cryptocurrency. The Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation has requested that local governments make an “orderly exit” from the industry.  China produces the most Bitcoin in the world using Bitcoin mining , which involves an energy-intensive process of solving complex math problems to add transactions to the Blockchain, a public ledger. But the crackdown is about more than the high levels of energy required to mine Bitcoin.Not just about the electricityChina is planning to limit electricity to Bitcoin miners, and government bodies have expressed concern about energy usage. Bitcoin mining is estimated to use up to 4 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three nuclear reactors' production levels.However, this move isn’t just about the electricity. In fact, it is telling that it was China's central bank that met on the issue of Bitcoin mining, underscoring the fact that the issue is not only, or even primarily, an energy issue. It’s about clamping down on perceived risks of the cryptocurrency, which regulators have associated with malicious acts like fraud and money laundering. Authorities have already cracked down on thousands of criminal cases associated with alternative cryptocurrencies, including Onecoin and Ticcoin. These cryptocurrencies were viewed as Ponzi schemes used to raise illicit funds. Later, officials shut down cryptocurrency exchanges and banned fundraising through initial coin offerings (ICOs). On Monday, it was reported that Chinese authorities would block cryptocurrency platforms that permit centralized trading.Cracking down on fraud and money laundering alone does not appear to be the way China is addressing risks associated with Bitcoin, however. Authorities are going after the industry more broadly. This may be because China has enough financial risks to regulate at the moment, and it is at capacity, or it could be that officials really do view Bitcoin as insufficiently transparent to represent an appropriate means of exchange or store of value.Alternatives to mining in ChinaChinese Bitcoin mining companies may be out of luck doing business in a favorable environment. To combat this, some companies have already moved operations overseas. Most recently, Bitmain Technologies set up a subsidiary in Switzerland, which will extend its branches, currently in Amsterdam, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Qingdao, Chengdu, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Bitcoin miners have also been attracted to the Canadian province of Québec for its advertised cheap electricity. However, other companies may be forced to shut down. Moving abroad is likely to result in higher energy costs, which can dramatically reduce profit margins gained from mining.Moving forwardMake no mistake, the energy issue is a problem. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts have argued that Bitcoin mining must switch to renewable energy. This makes sense, not only for countries like China that have previously relied on coal-powered energy, but for the world as it experiences climate change. I would even argue that the mining process should be altered so that it doesn't rely on enormous amounts of energy. This would require replacing computing power and its accompanying high energy usage with another barrier to entry, such as ownership of a specific technology. The most critical aspect to address for China, however, is criminal activity. Unfortunately, it is not known what percentage of cryptocurrency activity is associated with fraud or other crimes as parties remain unknown by name. It seems likely, from my perspective, that Bitcoin would be used most efficiently for larger-scale crimes in which quick conversion to a fiat currency is not essential. This is because cash can simply be used for petty or pedestrian crimes. For larger-scale crimes paid in Bitcoin, rapid money laundering remains a challenge, since converting Bitcoin to cash requires the registration of an identity and makes it easier to find criminals. No matter the type of criminal activity, however, it must be controlled.While cryptocurrencies were meant to be stateless, there is no avoiding the hand of the state in quashing criminal activity. China and other countries should set up regulations for Bitcoin to reduce crime. Bitcoin expert Professor Olivier Scaillet of the University of Geneva agrees, stating, ""if you regulate the use of bitcoin in terms of acceptance as a mean of payment, it is  a way to limit its criminal use."" There is no need to believe that the main issue with Bitcoin mining is the electricity cost. We know it is about the larger issue of fraud and other illicit activities. Therefore it makes sense to end the worst practices rather than all practices in this area."

The most recent scandal is the apparent hacking of the Japanese Bitcoin exchange Coincheck.

In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently took action to shut down an initial coin offering (ICO) that the agency alleges ""targeted retail investors to fund what it claimed to be the world’s first 'decentralized bank.'""""AriseBank and its co-founders Jared Rice Sr. and Stanley Ford allegedly offered and sold unregistered investments in their purported “AriseCoin” cryptocurrency by depicting AriseBank as a first-of-its-kind decentralized bank offering a variety of consumer-facing banking products and services using more than 700 different virtual currencies,"" the SEC stated.""AriseBank’s sales pitch claimed that it developed an algorithmic trading application that automatically trades in various cryptocurrencies.""There is no regulated bank (as of this writing) that deals directly in retail operations to sell or hold cryptocurrencies. Of course, that may change, when and if regulators can find a way to police the unregulated crypto market.And while I think the idea of blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, is generally a good idea, cryptos are not decentralized banking. They are not linked to anything other than software and it's hard to know who's trading them and why.There's also a cult-like devotion to Bitcoin, which could account for the bubble and irrational exuberance propelling its price into outer space. Here's Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist and a Nobelist in economics, recently:""Bitcoins lost about 40 percent of their value over the past six weeks; if Bitcoin were an actual currency, that would be the equivalent of a roughly 8,000 percent annual inflation rate. Oh, and Bitcoin’s untethered nature also makes it highly susceptible to market manipulation.""Like any trend in investing, those who don't know what they're doing will get burned. Here are some safeguards from the SEC:— Some companies are not required to file reports with the SEC. These are known as “non-reporting” companies. Investors should be aware of the risks of trading the stock of such companies, as there may not be current and accurate information that would allow investors to make an informed investment decision.— Investors should also do their own research and be aware that information from online blogs, social networking sites, and even a company’s own website may be inaccurate and potentially intentionally misleading. Be especially cautious regarding stock promotions, including related to new technologies such as ICOs.— If an offering is registered, you can find information (such as a registration statement or “Form S-1”) on SEC.gov through EDGAR.In other words, do your research. One or more technologies will make cryptocurrencies a viable alternative to our flawed banking system, but it's hard to tell which ones will survive. In the interim, you need to protect yourself."

If this piece does well, more pieces covering other arguments made by Bitcoin skeptics will be published.Bitcoin’s amazing price rise in 2017 led to everyone and their mothers commenting on the topics of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies over the past few months, which means there were plenty of skeptics around who wanted to tell everyone about how bitcoin is a fraud that has no underlying value at all.Whether they’re claiming Ripple is a fork of Bitcoin or GPUs are still useful for mining bitcoin, so-called “experts” are responsible for a lot of misinformation regarding this new technology in the mainstream press. This is possibly due to many of the people quoted in various media outlets specializing in more general areas of study rather than just Bitcoin itself.Bitcoin skeptics have been proven wrong more than 200 times when it comes to predicting the death of the digital bearer asset. Here are three of the lies these critics tell themselves, which are at the root of these false predictions.Here is the #bitcoin chart since @wadhwa published ""R.I.P., Bitcoin. It’s time to move on."" in @washingtonpost two years ago. (Pic via @CoinMarketCap)Then: $381.73Now: $14,616.60. pic.twitter.com/6sopMY2RQ4— Kyle Torpey (@kyletorpey) January 10, 2018Lie #1: Bitcoin Is A Ponzi SchemeThe claim that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is likely the oldest and most common argument used by those who have a negative view of Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention.Skeptics point out that those who wish to profit from their early speculations on the bitcoin price rely on more people to enter the system for their gains, in addition to talking about how there is no practical use of the cryptocurrency network. As Eric Posner wrote in Slate back in 2013:“Unless a bitcoin has value as a currency, it has no value at all, and its price in dollars will fall to zero. A regular Ponzi scheme collapses when people realize that earlier investors are being paid out of the investments of later investors rather than from the returns on an underlying asset. Bitcoin will collapse when people realize that it can’t survive as a currency because of its built-in deflationary features, or because of the emergence of bytecoins, or both. A real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion.”One of the points Posner missed in his 2013 assessment of bitcoin as an asset is that it provides a censor and seizure-resistant store of digital value. This property was further solidified in 2017 as the Bitcoin network proved resistant to the contentious SegWit2x hard fork attempt and the bitcoin price continued to rise despite historically high on-chain transaction fees (see my explanation for why this happened).Furthermore, if one considers bitcoin a Ponzi scheme, then the same logic must be applied to all other forms of money. Is gold also a Ponzi scheme due to the non-industrial uses of the precious metal? Are the fiat currencies widely used in the world today Ponzi schemes since they were bootstrapped by a peg to gold?Posner referred to bitcoin as a “collective delusion” in his piece for Slate, but as Derek Thompson pointed out in The Atlantic late last year, this has been a property of every form of money throughout history.The IMF has referred to bitcoin as a “naturally occurring Ponzi scheme,” which may be applicable to all forms of free market money.""Money is a bubble that never pops,"" said AngelList CEO and co-founder Naval Ravikant at a digital currency conference late last year.In short, there’s a reason people have decided to store value in bitcoin, and it has to do the intrinsic properties of the system such as a trustless monetary policy and resistance to seizure by governments.A final point that needs to be made here is bitcoin may very well be in a short-term price bubble (see Chain CEO Adam Ludwin’s arguments for why this price mania has occurred).Lie #2: Bitcoin Is Not SecureThere have been many hacks and thefts in Bitcoinland over the years, but this does not mean the system is not secure. These thefts have occurred at the layers above the base Bitcoin blockchain.Hackers often steal large amounts of credit card data from centralized servers that store this sort of data (usually a merchant like Target). With Bitcoin, security is pushed to the end user. Each user controls their own financial data in the form of private keys, so there is no central server for hackers to target.Of course, points of centralization still pop up in Bitcoin — mainly in the form of exchanges. When someone gives their bitcoin over to a centralized entity, they must trust that entity to secure the money. This turns exchanges and other bitcoin custodians into the biggest targets for hackers in the Bitcoin ecosystem.In reality, the hacks on bitcoin exchanges illustrate the value of the underlying Bitcoin blockchain from a security perspective.It should be noted that Bitcoin is likely to become even more secure due to technical developments that have taken place over the past few years. By implementing the Lightning Network or a federated sidechain (such as Blockstream’s Liquid), the level of risk associated with trading on a bitcoin exchange can be drastically reduced.Covenants are another innovation that could reduce the potential for theft, even when users are taking responsibility for their own funds. This solution would effectively allow a Bitcoin user to cancel a transaction made by a nefarious actor trying to steal funds.Obviously, hardware wallets and secure enclaves have also played a role in making it much easier to secure one’s own bitcoin.Lie #3: Bitcoin Cannot Be Used as MoneyThe idea that bitcoin cannot be used as money is one of the more puzzling claims made by skeptics. It’s similar to someone pointing out that Crocs are not shoes. Whether they’re called shoes or not does not matter. What matters is people are walking around with them on their feet.(Note: I forget the original source for the above Crocs analogy, so someone point me in the right direction if they remember where it came from.)The main criticism usually made in terms of bitcoin’s usefulness (or lack thereof) as money is that the price is far too volatile. A point that is missed here is those who are already using bitcoin as a store of value don’t care about the short-term price volatility (see my explainer on this point using an analogy of Bitcoin as a social network).It should also be mentioned that the bitcoin price has generally become more stable over time.There are also certain types of people in the world who have no option other than to use Bitcoin due to its permissionless properties. Whether it’s a teenager trying to buy some pot from a darknet market vendor in Kansas or a teenager in Venezuela who just wants to buy a new game on Steam or Xbox, Bitcoin is able to provide digital payment services to those who are unable to gain access to the global financial system.Now, I know what you’re thinking: “Steam stopped accepting bitcoin! It’s useless for payments due to the high costs of making a transaction and network congestion!”Yes, it has become uneconomical to make on-chain, low-value Bitcoin transactions. But claiming that Bitcoin is useless for these sorts of payments right now is like saying the Internet is useless for streaming video in 1993. The technology just needs time to mature.Layer-two solutions, such as the Lightning Network, are an attempt to build a payments layer on top of the base Bitcoin protocol. With the Lightning Network (or something like it), bitcoin-denominated payments can be instant and nearly free while retaining the trustless properties of the underlying blockchain.Whether a specific good is useful as money is in the eye of the beholder. It may not make sense for everyone in the world to use bitcoin as money right now, but for some people, it’s the best option available to them (see BitPesa Elizabeth Rossiello’s points on the usefulness of bitcoin in Africa).The reality is people have found Bitcoin to be so useful that the developers working on the project have been unable to scale the system to keep up with demand while also retaining its decentralized properties."

Instead of making payments, people are now interested in trading or hodling Bitcoin and other cryptoassets.Recently, it’s become clear that the popular bitcoin apps are going to be the ones that focus on speculating on cryptoassets rather than making payments with cryptocurrencies — at least for the foreseeable future.
Moving Away from PaymentsStripe, Steam and Microsoft all announced their abandonment of bitcoin recently due to problems associated with network congestion, higher transaction fees, and price volatility. Microsoft ended up bringing bitcoin back after confirming with BitPay that payments lower than $100 can still be made via the bitcoin payment processor.“[Bitcoin] transaction confirmation times have risen substantially; this, in turn, has led to an increase in the failure rate of transactions denominated in fiat currencies,” wrote Stripe’s Tom Karlo in a recent blog post. “Furthermore, fees have risen a great deal.”In addition to the abandonment of bitcoin by merchants and payment processors, we’ve also seen bitcoin-focused companies change their focus.Can't remember if this is old news or not.

In fact, they no longer accept new merchant signups.Everyone Wants to Trade CryptocurrenciesAlthough merchant adoption of bitcoin appears to be on the decline, people are still very much interested in bitcoin as a speculative asset. Coinbase was the most popular app in the Apple app store near the end of 2017, according to Recode.It turns out people don’t want to have some bitcoin on their smartphones in order to buy coffee at Starbucks. Instead, people want to speculate on the price of Bitcoin and other cryptoassets at the tap of a button.While Coinbase was becoming one of the most popular iPhone apps, other finance-related startups took notice. Robinhood and Square both recently announced that their users will be able to buy and sell Bitcoin from within their respective apps. The functionality is already enabled in Square’s Cash app, and Robinhood plans to offer multiple cryptoassets for speculation purposes.There’s also the case of Abra, which originally launched as a sort of permissionless alternative to Venmo, who now focuses on its ability to act as an investment platform. Additionally, bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain has enabled its users in the United Kingdom to buy and sell cryptoassets, and they’re rolling out that functionality in the United States as well.For now, it appears these sorts of apps that allow users to speculate on the price of bitcoin and altcoins will be the most popular.Why Did This Happen?So, what caused Bitcoin’s pivot from cryptocurrency to cryptoasset?Although integrating Bitcoin for payments makes sense for merchants (no fees or chargebacks), the same cannot be said for their customers, nearly all of whom don’t have any Bitcoin to spend. Additionally, the congestion on the network has made on-chain transactions impractical for small, time-sensitive payments, as Stripe and Steam pointed out.Having said that, we’re very much still in the early days of cryptocurrency, and as Xapo CEO and PayPal Board Member Wences Casares explained back in 2015, Bitcoin will likely need to become a store of value before it can become a useful medium of exchange. Once more people are holding Bitcoin, the issues associated with price volatility become less of an issue (see my full explanation of this point using an analogy of bitcoin as a social network).Although the payments use case has been tossed to the side for now, there is still plenty of value in Bitcoin as a seizure-resistant digital asset with a transparent, incorruptible monetary policy, as illustrated by Bitcoin’s price rise in the face of higher transaction fees.While all of these different apps are onboarding new people who will use bitcoin as a store of value, the Lightning Network, which is basically intended to be an additional payments layer built on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain, is also in development.Although businesses may dable with altcoins for a bit, the Lightning Network may be the most critical advancement for scaling any cryptocurrency to many more users over the long term (see my post on why the Lightning Network may diminish the value of altcoins focused on low transaction costs).Many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley originally viewed the Bitcoin network as PayPal 2.0, but now most people are talking about the bitcoin asset as digital gold. In time, both characterizations of the P2P digital cash system may be true.While we’re still in the onboarding phase for this technology, Silicon Valley will focus on building apps that allow everyone and their grandmothers to trade or simply store value in bitcoin and other cryptoassets."

The investors say that they collectively lost over $771,000 in their investment in the company and other damages. Bitconnect purportedly had a market capitalization of $2.6 billion on January 6, 2018, but was of this writing about three weeks later, it is down to $128 million. You can read more about the Bitconnect lawsuit here.","Next, according to another story you can read here, Tokyo-based Coincheck, Inc., reportedly lost somewhere around a half billion dollars' worth of its customer's blockchain tokens (a form of crytpocurrency) to hackers.But as big as these numbers are, they pale in comparison to the research paper entitled ""Price Manipulation In The Bitcoin Ecosystem"" as published in the Journal of Monetary Economics that one person was able to manipulate the price of Bitcoin in 2013 from $150 to $1,000. Meanwhile, one of my readers sent me a link to an article found here which suggests that there is significant price manipulation of Bitcoin going today. (Well, no duh.)The Bitcoin BubbleSo, in a single week we are presented with reports of significant fraud, theft, and price manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. This is hardly investment Utopia, and sadly it seems that most of the folks who are having their shirts stolen in crypocurrency are those who can least afford to lose it. In fact, there is increasing evidence that many of the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investors are not just gambling with money they can't afford to lose, but they are gambling with money they don't even have -- by purchasing cryptocurrencies by taking advances on their credit cards.All of this has made cryptocurrencies horrendously volatile -- their trading charts look the waves of a Bering Sea storm (with the exception of Bitconnect and a few others which looks like that cliff which Wiley E. Coyote always falls from).These bad things happen with governmental currencies too, but in a much, much lesser degree because those currencies are subject to government regulation and oversight. Take the dollar, for example. The dollar is just a little piece of paper, but it is subject to oversight by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, among others. Behind the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve is the U.S. Department of Justice and other law enforcement apparatus, such as the IRS Criminal Investigations branch. A private individual or group which attempts to significantly manipulate the U.S. dollar would find the full weight of the U.S. government coming after them and fast.The U.S. is hardly unique in this regard. All governments, through their Finance Secretaries or Central Banks or whatever, carefully regulate their currencies. It is this regulation that causes the currency to be treated with some degree or another of predictability, i.e., currencies move in relation to the markets and to each other, but these moves are typically at much more of a glacial pace -- routine daily swings of 10% or 20% just don't happen (yes, sometimes a currency will crater, such as Iraqi dinars, but not on a daily basis).Private currencies, including cryptocurrencies, are not regulated and have very little, if any, protection against price manipulation. The only self-policing that exists is the market itself, which is to say that investors in a cryptocurrency may quit buying at a given price if they suspect that price manipulation is occurring, but maybe not. There simply is no agency that is both looking for signs of price manipulation and can come flying in with a Cease & Desist order that says, ""Hey, you cut that out while you await the next-to-follow indictment.""This brings us to the Government Regulation Paradox: Cryptocurrencies need government regulation to deter price manipulation and related wrongs, but the absence of such regulation is one of the biggest reasons that many investors buy into cryptocurrencies in the first place.Otherwise stated, cryptocurrency investors desire the stability that comes with government regulation, but they don't want the cryptocurrency to be regulated by the government.The market alone will not fix this problem, since by the time the market figures out that significant price manipulation or fraud has occurred, it is a done deal. The horse is already out of that barn, and too bad so sad if you bought in at the high.It may be that in the future governments will start issuing their own (regulated) cryptocurrencies, establish exchange rates, and to all the other things that it takes for a currency to become viable. The technology of currency has long been headed this way anyhow, with paper money about to go the way of pretty sea shells and squirrel pelts.But we're not there yet. In the meantime, cryptocurrencies will continue to be highly volatile and subject to price manipulation. There is little doubt that we will see more Bitconnects where billions literally evaporate overnight.Better take that into account before you borrow against your credit card to buy more crypocurrencies.This article at https://goo.gl/DAQtfA"

cybercurrencies (or cryptocurrencies if you prefer). As with the prior ...","Feb 1, 2018,11:59pm EST","It used to be that bubbles largely harmed only folks in one particular country. Tulpenmanea (tulip bulbs, 1638) dinged the Dutch. The South Seas and Mississippi bubbles (1720) zapped the French. The ""Roaring Twenties"" stock market bubble (1929) mostly hurt only Americans. The Japanese stock bubble (1989) was largely confined to the Home Islands. The Dot-com bubble (2000) was largely contained to Americans.","The Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) bubble (2008) perhaps demonstrated for the first time that a bubble could significantly outgrow the borders of the country which gave it birth. Yet, as with other previous bubbles, the most direct effects hit those in the United States, even though the secondary effects on foreign investors and the world economy in general were quite significant.The Bitcoin BubbleThe Bitcoin Bubble, however, is the first truly world-wide bubble. Folks from all continents have significantly invested in Bitcoin and other cybercurrencies (or cryptocurrencies if you prefer). As with the prior bubbles, the vast bulk of these investors don't understand the fundamental economics of their investment, if it even exists, but they have seen other people make great riches and they want to quickly become multimillionaires as well. Thus, South Koreans are taking cash advances against their already deep-in-the-red credit cards to buy Bitcoins, ordinary Brazilians are using their carefully horded reals to buy Bitcoins, and American retirees are cashing out their 401(k) plans buy Bitcoins.Before the internet, folks outside the bubble home country didn't even hear about the deal until later, after it had burst, much less have an opportunity to invest. But with Bitcoin, the self-touted ""Currency of the Internet"", pretty much anybody with an internet connection can plunk down their pesos, yen, rubles and euros too. In this sense, the world really has come together since now anybody regardless of nationality can be a sucker.If there is a silver lining to this particular bubble, it is that (and quite unlike the MBS bubble which burst in 2008), the large institutional investors such as investment banks, insurance companies, pension funds and mutual funds have stayed safely on the sidelines. The pain of the Bitcoin bubble bursting may thus hit particular individuals quite hard, but there are unlikely to be an adverse systemic effects on any country's economy much less the worldwide economy.The question for the Bitcoin investors is now how low can it go? As with all investments, the ultimately theoretical answer is zero -- just ask the investors in any of hundreds of Dot-com companies if you don't believe it. However, it is possible that Bitcoin may survive at some level as a payment system, albeit at a much, much lower market capitalization value than when it got close to (and some say hit) $20,000 in December, 2017.The problem is that when a bubble builds and then bursts, the object of the bubble usually becomes seriously discredited and obtains a very negative reputation. Just as the Dutch didn't want to hear any more about tulip bulbs after 1638, and an entire generation of Americans swore off equity investments for the rest of their lives after the 1929 crash, it may be that crypocurrencies will suffer a similar fate.Or not. Even after the 2008 MBS crash, institutional investors again started buying mortgage securities for their relative safety (though presuming higher lending standards, we'll see how long that lasts). So it might be that crypocurrencies will survive at some, albeit diminished, level.The other silver lining is that the Bitcoin bubble drew the attention of large companies worldwide to the advantages of Blockchain technology, which maintains multiple ledgers of transactions that making hacking much more difficult. Numerous companies are using or starting to look into this technology, which has proven advantages. The trouble for cryptocurrency investors is that they don't own this technology, and are not going to be realizing any royalty rights for it.Yet, investors around the world may soon learn a valuable lesson, which is that anything that you don't fundamentally understand is unlikely to be a good investment for you. Most folks investing in Bitcoin have utterly no idea what it should really be worth, but are instead just blindly speculating that (in the spirit of the Ghostbuster Stairs Syndrome) ""it goes up"". That's not analysis, that's a prayer. By contrast, at least two noted economists have said that the correct value for Bitcoin is in the $20 range.For many worldwide, Bitcoin will prove to be quite valuable -- as a lesson in bubbles and buying in at the high.This article at https://goo.gl/tB2K5e"

[+] cryptocurrencies are classic bubbles that will burst eventually. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)“Bitcoin is not a currency because a currency is supposed to be a stable store of value and the currency that can fluctuate 25% in a day can’t be used for instance to pay wages because wages drop by 25% in a day. It’s a speculation. Based on a misunderstanding,” he added.Soros earned a reputation for making masterful calls based on macroeconomic conditions over several decades through his storied Quantum Fund, which produced average annual returns of 20% through its history. Seth Klarman, founder of the Baupost Group, also deemed bitcoin a bubble Thursday, calling cryptocurrencies “tulip bulbs for the digital age” in a fourth-quarter letter. Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, called the bitcoin a bubble in an interview with CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.Other high-profile investors have taken the opposite position. Bill Miller, chief investment officer of the Miller Value Partners hedge fund, told Consuelo Mack in a WealthTrack podcast that he had about 50% of the fund in bitcoin in December.Soros went on to comment on blockchain technology and the crash of bitcoin during his speech:“There’s also as very innovative blockchain technology, which can be used for positive or negative purposes. Currently it’s used mostly for tax evasion and for people and the rulers and dictatorships to build a nest egg abroad,” he said.So recently there was a just now a … conference where instead of discussing conditions in Russia they mainly discussed bitcoin because that’s what the rulers were interested in. So this will have a big effect on the valuation of bitcoin. Normally when you have parabolic eventually it has very sharp break but in this case as long as you have got dictatorships on the rise you will have a different ending because the rulers in those countries are going to turn to bitoin to build their nest egg abroad. So I expect instead of an abrupt break to have a rather flat top over.But it’s nevertheless a bubble typical which is always based on a misunderstanding like the tulip mania. But the blockchain technology can be put to positive use and we use it actually in helping migrants to communicate with their families and to keep their money safe and carry it with themselves.""This article originally appeared HERE.

of ...","Jan 7, 2018,02:52pm EST","A month ago, my article Seven Lies Bitcoin Fans Tell Themselves (And Anyone Else Who Will Listen) clearly struck a nerve, as almost half a million people read it.","Each of those readers will take heart in the fact that there are plenty more such lies to go around – especially if we include all of the alternative cryptocurrency coinage springing forth like tulips in the snow, what aficionados refer to as altcoins.Here, then, is the sequel.Cybercurrency: tulips in the snowLie #1: The ‘Black and White’ FallacyIn the previous article, I pointed out that Bitcoin wasn’t sufficiently similar to other things to draw comparisons. A common response: I fell into my own trap by making comparisons between, say, the Bitcoin bubble and other speculative bubbles or between Bitcoin and ‘real’ money.Such responses are examples of the black and white fallacy: assuming that for a given argument, only the two most extreme positions are under consideration. Such extremist thinking pervades the cryptocurrency world.A common argument that succumbs to this fallacy: there are problems with putting governments in charge of the money supply, so we need a money supply independent of any government. Perhaps working within the system to improve how government operates would be more efficacious, hmm?Lie #2: Bitcoin’s Market Cap is RelevantThe formula for market capitalization is simple, but deceiving: multiply the number of Bitcoin (or any altcoin) in existence by the market value of such a coin, and voila! A number that represents…what, exactly?As I write this, Bitcoin’s market cap is over a quarter of a trillion dollars. That doesn’t mean, however, that there’s a bucket with that much cash in it under a rainbow somewhere, ready to be divvied up amongst all the lucky leprechaun-seekers holding Bitcoin.In reality, when the bubble is about to pop and everyone seeks to cash in, the total amount to be divvied up can never be more than the amount people invested in Bitcoin over time – and that number is far, far smaller than its current market cap.Lie #3: Decentralized Transaction Processing is a Good IdeaAs with any blockchain-based technology, every cryptocurrency’s transaction infrastructure depends upon a number of decentralized transaction processors.In the case of Bitcoin, we call these processors ‘miners,’ because of the Bitcoin infrastructure rewards such miners with new Bitcoin.For cryptocurrencies that follow this model (and not all of them do), there are a number of problems. Mining becomes increasingly expensive and consumes massive quantities of electricity – but those aren’t even the biggest problems.The ticking time bomb behind Bitcoin and all similar currencies: if the market value of the reward for mining drops below the cost of mining, then miners will stop mining. Which means that nobody will process transactions. Which means the entire Bitcoin infrastructure grinds to a halt. For good.For altcoins that don’t reward transaction processors with new coins, there’s even less reason to continue to participate once the hype dies down.The solution? Centralize transaction processing, like 
 
Visa
, 
 
Mastercard
, and all the banks do. Which, of course, makes cryptocurrency pointless.Lie #4: ‘HODL’ is a Rational StrategySome cryptocurrency speculators are all too happy to sell on the upswings and buy on the downswings, a surefire way to make money – as long as you can time your transactions properly, of course.But other speculators are HODLers – HODL standing for ‘hold on for dear life.’ The HODL strategy assumes that the value of Bitcoin or altcoin in question will multiply many times in the future, and thus a HODLer won’t sell no matter how volatile the price.In reality, the sheer quantity of HODLers are simply propping up the speculative value of the cryptocurrency, giving the more active traders a better chance of getting out with some profit.Remember, the only people who make money in a speculative bubble are the ones that get out in time. Everyone else is a loser. Which is essentially what HODLers are.Lie #5: Cryptocurrencies Can Be a Viable Medium of Exchange and also Artificially ScarceBitcoin’s most important innovation is perhaps its artificial scarcity. There is a maximum number of possible Bitcoin, creating more is increasingly difficult, and the blockchain infrastructure prevents double-spending any of it.Such artificial scarcity is essential to Bitcoin’s speculative value, but operates at cross purposes with any effort to make it a viable medium of exchange. After all, who would want to buy – or sell – a cup of coffee with Bitcoin if one day that cup cost $5, the next $50, and the day after that $10?In fact, if I were to invent a cryptocurrency that could serve as a viable medium of exchange, it would make far more sense to base the value of one of my coins on, say, an average of the top ten fiat currencies (aka ‘real money’).Such a cryptocurrency wouldn’t have artificial scarcity, however, and thus wouldn’t be particularly useful as a speculative vehicle. And where’s the fun in that?Lie #6: Innovation in Altcoins Will Fix the Issues with Bitcoin There are hundreds of altcoins out there, with more appearing out of nowhere every day. Now that even die-hard Bitcoin aficionados are realizing that Bitcoin itself has a number of technical issues, they are rapidly jumping ship to various altcoins that purport to solve the problems with Bitcoin.The problem with this argument is that by far the primary motivation for this shift are Bitcoin’s shortcomings as a medium for criminal enterprise. It’s not anonymous enough for child pornographers and too volatile for money launderers, in particular.So where is the innovation focusing? On altcoins that better meet the needs of such criminals – not on priorities that align with bona fide, legal business drivers. From the perspective of legal commerce, today’s innovation is creating more issues, not fewer.Lie #7: Coins from ICOs will Have ValuePerhaps the craziest corner of an already insane cryptocurrency circus is the world of initial coin offerings (ICOs). Vaguely similar to initial public offerings (IPOs), ICOs are a way for startups to raise money from investors.That, however, is where the similarities end. In essence, to implement an ICO, a startup creates a large number of some brand-new kind of altcoin out of thin air and sells many of them to speculators.There are a number of variations on the specifics, including how many of the altcoins the founders retain and what can be done with extra ones left over after the ICO.The startup then supposedly uses the real money they get from selling the fake Monopoly money they just printed up to get a blockchain-related business off the ground (unless they’re complete scammers, of course, which many are).Then something magical happens, and everyone who bought the altcoins at the ICO sells them for a profit. Just what magical occurrence imbues such worthless bits of, well, bits, depends upon the business model of the startup – but one thing the investors don’t get is an ownership stake in the company.At least you can play Monopoly with real Monopoly money. However, with ICO-generated coinage, there is rarely even a speculative market, because there are simply too many ICOs with too many new altcoins.Want to put a hotel on Park Place? You’re out of luck. All that new altcoin isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on – if there were paper, which there isn’t.Welcome to the world of cryptocurrency.Intellyx publishes the Agile Digital Transformation Roadmap poster, advises companies on their digital transformation initiatives, and helps vendors communicate their agility stories.

This means that funds cashed out from one currency were invested in other currencies.That’s a bullish ""technical"" sign for cryptocurrencies, as it keeps the momentum for the sector alive.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don't own any cryptocoins or tokens.]The worse days were early this week when the sell-off in major cryptocurrencies spread across the entire sector. This means that money cashed out from one cryptocurrency didn’t flow to other cryptocurrencies, but moved to cash or to other investments.And that’s a bearish sign for cryptocurrencies, as it undermines the momentum for the sector.Apparently, momentum is changing very fast in cryptocurrencies, much faster than in other asset classes.That’s why technical analysis alone may not be a reliable indicator for trying to guess the direction of the cryptocurrency markets.What about fundamental analysis?For the vast majority of cryptocurrencies there are no fundamentals to talk about, other than a website with a message that promises to make capitalism better.For major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, there’s some information to make both a bullish and a bearish case.The bullish case is about the advantages Bitcoin has a “headless” currency. ""Increasingly widely accepted as a means of payment with no bank intermediation and absolutely no fees, Bitcoin has some of the attributes of a headless currency,” says Eric Pichet, a KEDGE professor.Then there’s the rarity of the cryptocurrency and the low ownership rate, which explain its price spike, and the potential for further gains. “The relative rarity of the virtual product explains its rise in large part because only 0.01% of the world population own any,” adds Pichet. “Therefore, one can imagine the effect on its trading price if the primary cause of speculative bubbles, namely FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) were to spread to a mere 1% of the world population, or 100 times more holders.”The bearish scenario centers on two major threats which cryptocurrencies face. One of them is an intrusion in the blockchain system and the circulation of fake coins. Another threat is a concerted effort by governments around the world to ban their use.As Eric Pichet concludes, ""Under these conditions, what type of needles would burst the bubble? The first would be the heist of the century: an intrusion in the blockchain system that created a deluge of fake bitcoins. The second would be the adoption of a common position by all national governments and central banks to prohibit this means of payment in the name of fighting fraud, for example.”"

[+] 2017 DealBook Conference at Jazz at Lincoln Center on November 9, 2017 in New York City. (Photo by Michael Cohen/Getty Images for The New York Times)This is only fun if you start with the possibilities. Bitcoin is just one of an emerging set of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin CEO Roger Ver shouted its promise in a recent video.[1] Here is his summary of why fans of currency should get in the crypto game:Ver is obviously all in. He views buying and selling this currency as an inevitability, not just a possibility. As he puts it, “the only way to stop it is to turn off the entire internet in the entire world, and keep it off. Even China can’t do that.”Enter Mark Cuban. He appropriately owns a team called the Dallas Mavericks, as he has historically been a maverick among NBA’s older line of owners. Assuming Bitcoin remains capped at 21 million, the scarcity could drive demand skyward faster than any NBA team ticket sales, or media rights contracts.The Cuban Bitcoin project is probably his attempt to remain relevant to a “maverick” fan base. All owners want to grow their fan base. Going international is a primary method they all embrace. But who else has attempted to court math nerds, since algorithms are fundamental to mining cryptocurrencies? Those in my type one above,who are already sold on digital currencies, may love to see the experiment grow to fruition in this industry. Those who were on the fence may use the game they love as the leaping point.As Cuban admitted in an email,  “Some people want to buy products in Krypto to prove a point. We are happy to make it easy for them.” [3]If it works, Cuban will have two out of three types on the crypto divide. In basketball, shooting 66 percent from the field is damn good. In a highly competitive 30-team industry, being the first could be worth its weight in Crypto, whatever that is or will be.He may also be looking to attract enlightened NBA players searching for business future beyond, yet through the sport. As sure as NBA players like money, someone trying to grow the money business in their sport probably will get their attention even if they do not yet know how it works.NBA’s forward-thinking owners realize that New Age Athletes are getting smarter. To attract them as free agents, they better offer business opportunities beyond basketball. The Golden State Warriors already lured veteran cerebral players like Andre Iguodala into the fold. The new 2010 owners embraced exposing players to business opportunities. That ownership group includes YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley, Joe Lacob, a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Peter Guber, chairman of Mandalay Entertainment Group. They have reportedly viewed the Warriors as an extension of their businesses, connecting players with Silicon Valley like no other team in NBA history. That, in part, brought Iguodala to the Warriors, and may bring more veterans like him.Iguodala has become part of the Warrior business network, being courted by various businesses in their road show presentations.  To date he has invested in about 25 startups based on a vetting of portfolios. The Warriors also hired David Kelly as its general counsel. Kelly has been a skilled litigator and rapper known as Capital D. His last album, “Polymath” has gained traction among some players with hopes to follow him – to the Warriors and to a profitable version of musical chairs.[4]Cuban is probably contemplating how the dangle a currency carrot. He is probably undeterred by recent talk about digital currency regulation or the fact that Bitcoin has high volatility, including a period when it lost as much as 48 percent of its value from its December 18, 2017 high.[5] Cuban may be thinking he will create no less than three things: a media buzz, a unique fan base of Currency Crusaders, and saliently, his own laboratory within which to experiment on how he can make it work. It would be sort of like his own intranet.  And if certain cerebral players endorse whatever Cuban can do with his control group, he may attract the next group of Iguodala All-Stars.Of course, this all seems far-fetched to most. So did using a phone for most of our communications before Apple. Cuban is looking to introduce Bitcoin to his home games next season. Most of us will not invest. But more of us will watch Cuban’s Maverick operations than ever before.[1] Camila Russo, Mark Cuban Says Mavericks To Accept Cryptocurrencies Next Year, January 16, 2018, BloombergTechnology[2] See Exhibit A James Harden, and Exhibit B James[3] Camila Russo, Mark Cuban Says Mavericks To Accept Cryptocurrencies Next Year, January 16, 2018, Bloomberg Technology[4] See Staci Zaretsky, Before Becoming GC Of The Golden State Warriors, This Lawyer Was A Rapper, abovethelaw.com.

An increasing number of social enterprises are turning to the technology, the underpinning of Bitcoin, as well as cryptocurrency, to create secure, accessible platforms for the poor around the world.One of the latest entries is Moeda. The New York City-based startup, launched last year, has a micro-lending platform that uses blockchain and a cryptocurrency named MDA to connect investors to unbanked populations in emerging countries.For now, the focus is on cooperatives in Brazil, especially on women-owned enterprises, offering interest rates of 15%. That's compared to the 120% or so they would usually have to pay other lenders, according to CEO Taynaah Reis. The cooperative structure is common in Brazil, according to Reis; enterprises encompass everything from milk production plants to yucca farms.The current system, according to Reis, is bad for both cooperatives and investors. Many of these cooperatives, mostly located in rural areas, have a tough time getting loans, and that’s especially true for women. Generally they borrow through a government program, but the red tape and bureaucracy often prove to be impenetrable. Plus, even when they get a loan, they don’t receive technical assistance.For investors, there’s the problem of trust in the system, especially in light of Brazil’s recent plague of corruption.With that in mind, Moeda uses blockchain technology, which is often described as an open distributed ledger, to create a platform through which investors can easily track projects in a transparent way. Result: All activities are out in the open, nothing can be erased and you know your money is getting into the right hands. “Over the years, I’ve seen investors consider social enterprises in Brazil to be a risk,” says Reis, “Trust is important, especially in a country like Brazil--and blockchain allows us to nurture that trust.”Plus, the company provides not just access to funding, but help in creating a business plan, feasibility studies and other technical assistance. And it considers nontraditional credit history factors, such as the impact cooperatives have on their communities, in addition to placing a priority on investing in women.So far, according to Reis, they’ve raised money from a large crop of investors--841--mostly from China, which has a long history of trading with and investing in Brazil. The majority are 22-to-28-year-olds interested in combining impact and investment.In August Reis and her comrades raised $20 million over a two-week period, allotting $10 million of that to funding projects. It's invested in 18 of them so far, with loans ranging from $50,000 to $300,000. Case in point: a six-month $55,000 loan to Hope Valley, a 10-year-old cooperative pumpkin and yucca farm and food processor in Formosa, Brazil. The money helped pay for an irrigation system and food processing equipment. Thanks to the investment, the co-op is able to produce five times more than before, according to Reis. And the number of contracts to public schools grew from 30 to 90.Hope ValleyThe next step will be to launch an app over the next few months allowing individual and institutional investors to make direct investments of MDAs into companies. So there will be no intermediary. Investors will buy the MDA tokens, much as they do when purchasing Bitcoin, and make their investments through the app. Then entrepreneurs will receive the loan in MDA and exchange their tokens for local currency. The company is working with a  group of cooperative banks in Brazil serving local populations in underdeveloped areas.It all started last March, when Reis organized a UN-sponsored hackathon focusing on applying blockchain technology to meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals; she also served as a judge. One of the participating teams submitted the basic concept behind Moeda—and won. Intrigued by the idea, Reis approached winners Isa Yu and Brad Chun and suggested they start a real company, using the prize money to launch the startup. "

Will I lose money ...","Editors' Pick|Jan 12, 2018,12:34pm EST",Every new technology faces incredible hurdles.,"Without a great PR campaign – communicating the benefits of the breakthrough - from innovators, early adopters, inventors, banks, regulators, investors who made money, investors who lost money, and the media who must translate this innovation to the masses, any game-changer can eventually become the next Betamax or MySpace.Take Cryptocurrency. Please!The Bitcoin market, which has surged from about $1,000 to $20,000 and back down again … wait, now it’s back up ….. has captured headlines around the world not just for its investment potential but for its revolutions in financial payment. Cryptocurrency is the technology behind Bitcoin and other formats. The major issues everyone wants to know are:There’s a huge public relations element to any new technology. Most die a very quiet death, forgotten and ignored. Only a few breakthroughs actually break through.   Remember, Public Relations is the Persuasion Business.  If the masses are not convinced of the safety, investment potential and ease of use of cryptocurrency, all the hipsters, futurists and techno-nerds will be trading amongst themselves like obscure comic book collectors or Area 51 theorists exchanging UFO theories.The first hurdle is comprehension. most people don’t understand the cryptocurrency.  There’s a great description from my friend and former client, attorney Sky Moore, in Forbes, with a glossary of terms.""Blockchains are permanent records of transactions that are recorded on chains of individual computers (“blocks,” and thus the name “blockchain”). By creating a permanent digital record over an entire chain, blockchains permit instant verification and authentication of any information, including contracts, account information, currency transactions, and records of stock ownership. Because of this versatility, blockchains will be used for countless different purposes in the future.Cryptocurrency means any digital medium of exchange, generally traded using a blockchain. A cryptocurrency only has value to the extent that people are willing to accept it in exchange for something else, like dollars. Thus, there needs to be a sufficient supply for the cryptocurrency to act as a medium of exchange but a limited supply in order to prevent a collapse in value. Anyone can issue a cryptocurrency, even governments (and some have).Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, and it also introduced and used blockchain technology.""A picture shows a Bitcoin ATM on December 11, 2017 in Rovereto, northern Italy. Bitcoin surged past... [+] $18,000 after making its debut on a major global exchange but was trading lower on December 11, 2017, highlighting the volatility of the controversial digital currency that has some investors excited but others nervous. / AFP PHOTO / PIERRE TEYSSOT (Photo credit should read PIERRE TEYSSOT/AFP/Getty Images)All revolutions are obvious in hindsight. Usually the process isn’t smooth. Slate magazine humorously explains stages of adoption of successful new technologies detailing the emotional barriers people build to shield themselves from the cutting edge.“Stage 1: “It will kill us all!!”Reaction upon first hearing about some early scientific or technology research being conducted by a university, corporation, or government. Usually the coverage appears in a technology or science magazine with a snappy headline but little substance. Next comes a clever screenwriter who turns the wee bit of science into a science fiction popcorn thrill ride that literally shows us how the world will end but contains even less real science.Stage 2: “It will steal my daughter!!”Reaction upon the dramatic success of said technology following its introduction to the market. This is usually where the moral panic sets in, perhaps brought on by a conversation in a bar/church/school-pickup line or a quick story on the nightly news telling you that you need to be afraid (typically accompanied with video of children walking home from school and using the technology).Stage 3: “I’ll never use it!!”Reaction upon receiving the said technology as a Christmas or birthday gift after the boogeyman of doom has slowly faded. Soon after insisting that he/she will never use this thing, the person may realize how useful and/or fun it can be.Stage 4: “What are you going on about?”As people begin using the technology in their daily lives, they forget about the fear. I would humbly like to submit Johnson’s Addendum to Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic until about two weeks of using the technology, upon which time it becomes mundane.”Ayelet Noff, my cool, futuristic international PR friend from Blonde 2.0, a PR firm with offices in Tel Aviv and Boston, represents several crytocurrency and blockchain companies. Obviously she’s pro-technology on this issue, but she makes a good argument.“Cryptocurrency and blockchain are all about decentralizing and taking the power away from the bigger institutions and putting it back in the hands of the people,” Noff says. “If you look back in history, if you fight technology, you are never going to win.  We see what's happening with Bitcoin, it's skyrocketing. You really have to be very ignorant to fight against it.  Right now the banks are scared and they are trying to find a way to work with these companies to see how to integrate blockchain into their systems.”The promise of crytocurrency is bypassing the banks and credit card companies, bypassing the fees, the regulations and yes, the regulators, with non-traceable transactions. That’s the Utopian opinion. Many financial institutions and leading economists consider Bitcoin a fad or a scam, offering a Dystopian view.Robert Shiller, a Nobel prize winner for his work on bubbles, was quoted by CNN explaining currency appeals to investors because it has an ""anti-government, anti-regulation feel.""""It's such a wonderful story,"" he said at a conference. ""If it were only true.""Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein told Bloomberg that the currency serves as ""a vehicle for perpetrating fraud."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on CNBC that it ""seems like a bubble.""On CNBC President Ronald Reagan’s Former Director of the Office of Management David Stockman stated: ""It's basically a class of really stupid speculators who have convinced themselves that trees grow to the sky. It will burn out in a spectacular crash. All of these latter-day speculators will have their hands burned to a crisp, and they will learn the proper lesson.""The Washington Post took a balanced look at the phenomenon, with an article called “Five Myths About Bitcoin.""""It works. It’s not a scam. But it’s not magic. And it won’t replace credit cards and cash.  “Many utopian bitcoin supporters, such as Kim Dotcom, creator of the Megaupload file-sharing site, predict bitcoin will overtake other payment schemes. “In five years, if you try to use fiat currency, they will laugh at you,” says major Silicon Valley investor Tim Draper.But bitcoin does not yet have several key properties needed for a universal payment mechanism. First, the design currently limits the system to handling only a few transactions per second, nowhere near the tens of thousands that credit card networks can handle, nor the tens of thousands more done in cash every second. The community has worked for years on various plans to improve bitcoin’s capacity, but there is no agreed-upon path forward.Second, bitcoin transactions, once free, are increasingly expensive, with fees now averaging $20 and reaching as high as $400, based on demand. Developers are working to improve capacity, but for now the trend is going in the wrong direction. Finally, bitcoin transactions do not take effect immediately because of the limitations of the blockchain. New transactions are added only every 10 minutes, on average, and when users desire extra security, they can take more than an hour. Even with planned improvements, it’s unclear if the technology can ever become a universal payment system. Bitcoin is more like a reserve store of value, akin to gold bullion or Treasury notes, than a day-to-day tender.”With the steady but sure adoption of the blockchain technology, whether it’s used for Bitcoin, Fitcoin, Bitfit, chicken and biscuits or some other currency, appears as if it’s here to stay. As for the utopian version of free untraceable transactions, that’s a little more far-fetched. Unless my sources inside Area 51 are wrong. "

(Shutterstock),"As we enter into 2018 it is clearly impossible to ignore Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency for that matter.  They have broken into everyday discussions on financial markets.  Not only does Bitcoin now regularly flash across your TV screen on financial media but there are two Bitcoin futures contracts and a large number of ETF applications.  There are clearly true believers in cryptocurrencies and they were incredibly well rewarded last year.  There are those who shout bubble, but have been shouting bubble since Bitcoin was below $100 and are becoming reminiscent of people walking the streets with 'the end is nigh' placards.  In between are those who are merely dabbling, those who are reluctant but feel compelled to be involved, to those who quite frankly seem to like the adrenaline rush.As I have been trying to think about where people are in terms of adoption of Bitcoin, I thought of the Kubler-Ross model (link).Denial.  There are still some who just ignore Bitcoin.  They don't hate it, they just don't see it as relevant.  Anything else that has a total market cap this large would resonate for them, but they continue to believe that they can function perfectly well, while ignoring cryptocurrencies, despite them having an ever more obvious influence on markets.Anger.  Anyone still starting bitcoin articles with Tulips in the title is just angry.  The person carefully crafting charts plotting other historical bubbles against Bitcoin is angry.  Googling Sir Isaac Newton to see how much he lost in the South Sea Bubble is just anger.  Talking about how 'its only paper' money or forwarding articles detailing how you might be worth $X million on paper but that you can't spend a bitcoin is just stuck in anger and not helping themselves.Bargaining.  Grudgingly admitting that 'blockchain' the technology might be useful but that doesn't mean Bitcoin will be. Arguing that Bitcoin is the MySpace of digital currencies and when the Facebook is created, you will buy that.  Deciding that if Bitcoin goes back below $1,000 you will buy - just in case.Depression.  I can't believe I missed Bitcoin.  Then I missed Litecoin.  Then I missed Etherium.  Then I missed Ripple. UGH!!!!  How much ripple does everyone have?  Am I the only person who doesn't own crypto?  How could I have missed this!! Why did I listen to so and so - they clearly were too old for this.  I should have listened to those other guys.  I can't believe I missed the opportunity of a lifetime.Acceptance.  It really isn't too late.  If you think about it, there are only futures on Bitcoin.  ETFs haven't launched.  I know Joe - the old fool - doesn't even have a Coinbase account and still thinks a wallet is made of leather!  Yeah, I might have missed some of this, but there is a lot more opportunity to come.  I might have missed the first wave or second wave, but it was really risky back then.  Now, it seems so obvious in hindsight and it really isn't that late.I don't know where you are in this model, but I suspect that the last 2 months have seen a lot of people reach 'acceptance' and while there are more people at earlier stages, who can all eventually become adopters, I think they are stuck and near term adoption will be slow (which I think is evidenced by what I view as underwhelming performance of the futures contracts so far - not in terms of price - but in terms of volumes and liquidity).For those who do view Bitcoin as a bubble, this model is actually helpful as it helps explain how people get from the point of not caring to buying - which is a key ingredient to any bubble and I think the last time I used this model was in 2007 regarding housing. "

intentionally doesn't list every investment type available), Bitcoin is ...","Jan 11, 2018,08:00am EST",Shutterstock,"According to a study published earlier this year by the National Institute on Retirement Security, 88% of Americans believe we are in a retirement crisis. What does this tell me? It’s time to change the status quo and look at alternatives.I have witnessed firsthand the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies in 2017. Investing in digital currencies for your IRA or 401k enables you to diversify your retirement portfolio without relying on the stock market, and the price of one Bitcoin has increased over 1,000% in the past year. It’s time to look at saving for retirement as an exciting experience rather than a painstaking one.However, there’s currently a lot of conflicting information floating around the internet about everything in the cryptocurrency space, from wallet storage options to do-it-yourself versus full-service companies, so I decided it was time to set the record straight. Here are four warnings that I’d like to share with people who are looking to invest in digital currencies for their IRA or 401k.Watch Out For Misleading StatementsLet’s look at the facts: Virtual currencies are treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes, according to the 2014 IRS ruling. While the IRS doesn’t specifically mention “Bitcoin IRAs” under the law (it intentionally doesn't list every investment type available), Bitcoin is eligible for inclusion in IRA investments, provided that investments comply with standard IRS regulations. Statements to the contrary may be considered misleading.There is some confusion surrounding the terms ""IRS approved"" and ""IRS compliant."" So what’s the difference?Well, you can think of “IRS approved” and “IRS compliant” as a difference in syntax more than anything else. The IRS does not “review or approve investments” or “endorse any investments.” However, as long as the companies comply with regulations, cryptocurrency investments are IRS compliant and treated as property for federal tax purposes.Beware Of Do-It-Yourself Programs For IRAsThere are many do-it-yourself IRA investment companies out there promoting their services, and while there are some benefits to a self-directed brokerage IRA, it's important to know what you're getting into before you sign up.If you go down this route, a custodian will set up an LLC model in your name, making you the CEO of your own hedge fund. That’s where they leave you. You are now on your own to find a trustworthy exchange, execute the trade to Bitcoin, maintain IRS compliance and secure your investment with a digital wallet. This can put you at risk for dipping into a prohibited transaction unknowingly.Some self-directed IRA companies recommend consulting with legal counsel every step of the way to prevent inadvertently crossing into prohibited territory. However, that can be extremely costly and tiresome, and if you don’t use an attorney familiar with cryptocurrency policies, it could result in legal issues.Not All Bitcoin Wallets Are The SameBitcoin and cryptocurrency investments are stored in digital wallets, but not all digital wallets are created equal. It’s important for customers to keep this in mind when they are looking for a reliable wallet to store long-term cryptocurrency IRA investments.One primary distinction is that some digital wallets, such as BitGo, support multiple coins, while others, like Xapo, only support Bitcoin. In the event of a blockchain split, customers using the second wallet may not receive their coins in the new token. Some wallets are also based overseas, which can complicate tax and reimbursement and lead to lagging customer support, which is especially troublesome when spam and security concerns crop up.Make sure to do your homework and find out what each digital wallet provides before you make a decision about where to store your cryptocurrency IRA investment.Cheaper Isn't BetterIt makes sense to want to shop around and find the best deal, but I have to caution customers that cheaper is not always better. As we discussed before, you may find that do-it-yourself models have cheaper initial fees, but you have to do everything yourself, and the amount of money you’ll have to spend verifying each transaction with legal counsel beforehand will likely far exceed the cost of a full-service company that does everything for you.Other companies can promise to sell Bitcoin below market price, but these programs can often come with a number of strings attached, such as six-month fulfillment terms and purchasing mining equipment.Overall, it’s important to remember that fees are higher to place Bitcoins in an IRA than fees for traditional assets and securities like stocks or mutual funds. This is largely due to the complexity of purchasing and holding cryptocurrency. At each step of the purchase process, there are additional costs that traditional stock purchases don’t have.By keeping these four warnings in mind, you’ll be equipped to make a more informed decision about where to store your cryptocurrency IRA investment."

The auction is in connection with various federal criminal, civil and administrative cases.","There is no disclosed reserve price for this auction, which will take place over a six-hour period on January 22 from 9:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST), and the United States Marshals Service saying it “reserves the right to sell some, all or none of the Bitcoins for any reason.” It is the sixth Bitcoin auction that the USMS have held to date.In order to register, potential bidders must complete all the necessary registration requirements by noon EST on January 19 via email (USMSBitcoins@usdoj.gov). A $200,000 deposit is required to participate, with deposits being returned to non-winning bid (within five business days), while the deposit of the winning bidder is retained by USMS and credited towards the purchase price.The sealed bid auction for approximately 3,813 Bitcoins separated into three series, as follows:Individuals will not have the opportunity to view other bids and nor will they have the opportunity to change their bid once submitted. Bids to U.S. Marshals Service will only be accepted by email from pre-registered bidders only.(Image: Shutterstock).While open to foreign citizens (non-U.S. nationals), bids will not however be accepted from any person or entity that appears on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control list of “Specially Designated Nationals.” And, all deposit and purchase funds must be received from a U.S. bank.The required items for registration include: A manually signed pdf copy of the “Bidder Registration Form”; a copy of a Government-issued photo ID for the Bidder (or Control Person(s) of Bidder); a Deposit in US Dollars sent by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) originating from a bank located within the United States; and, a copy of the EFT transmittal receipt. (Note: The USMS accepts EFTs via Automated Clearing House (ACH) Credit or Fedwire).Should the winning bid(s) for any of the three series of cryptocurrency blocks fail to send funds to USMS by wire transfer from a bank located in the U.S. by 2:00 P.M. EST, on Tuesday, January 23, 2018, or not close the transaction through no fault of the USMS, it is explained that the bidder will “forfeit” their deposit(s) to the USMS. The winning bidder(s) will be notified January 22.Bidding In The AuctionA single registration form allows an individual to bid on multiple blocks from Series A, Series B, and Series C at the same per Bitcoin price. It does not allow multiple bids at differing per-Bitcoin prices to be submitted.Consequently if one wants to bid multiple prices on the different blocks, then additional registration forms and additional deposit funds ($200,000 a time) will be need to be submitted.As an example, if a bidder wanted to purchase two blocks of Series A and one block of Series B at different prices (e.g. say $X per Bitcoin for 500 Bitcoins from Series A, $Y per Bitcoin for 500 Bitcoins from Series A, and $Z per Bitcoin for 100 Bitcoins from Series B), they need to submit three separate registration forms - and total deposit of $600,000.A fact sheet on the auction process explains that the USMS will notify all bidders about their eligibility to participate in the auction by email no later than 5:00 PM EST on Friday, January 19, 2018. And, should the USMS determine that any individual is not an eligible bidder, deposit funds will be returned, and they will not be eligible to participate in the online auction.Individuals participating will not have the opportunity to view other bids and nor will they have the opportunity to change their bid once submitted.The Bitcoins being auctioned by the USMS were forfeited in a number of federal criminal, civil and administrative cases, include:Asset Forfeiture StatisticsIn terms of asset forfeiture made as a whole by the U.S. Marshals Service, the value of assets on hand as of September 30, 2016 stood at $1.5 billion, with the amount distributed to victims of crime and claimants being $183 million and the amount shared with participating state and local law enforcement agencies at $305 million.The U.S. Marshals Service plays a critical role in identifying and evaluating assets that represent the proceeds of crime as well as efficiently managing and selling assets seized and forfeited by the Department of Justice.The Marshals Service manages a wide array of assets, including art, antiques, cash, collectibles, commercial businesses, financial instruments, real estate, vehicles, jewellery, vessels and aircraft. Proceeds generated from asset sales are used to operate the program, compensate victims and support various law enforcement efforts.With regard to the proceeds from the sales attributable to each case - related to these Bitcoin sales - a spokesman for the USMS said that they ""will be handled differently, depending on the case.""While there is no disclosed reserve price for the auction that takes place on January 22, the USMS stated that it “reserves the right to sell some, all or none of the Bitcoins for any reason.” Bids received before or after the online auction period will not be considered as will those bids that do not conform to the instructions.Clearly, having to make a deposit of $200,000 to take part in the auction may preclude many investors, but syndicates could bid through a single named individual. For further details on the bidding process view this link.Note: Subsequent to this story being published, the U.S. Marshals Service announced on March 5 that they were to hold another Bitcoin auction - their seventh such auction - for approximately 2,170 Bitcoins (c.$24 million) - in 14 blocks (2 x 500 Bitcoins; 11 x 100 Bitcoins; and, 1 x c.70 Bitcoins). To be held on March 19 (from 8am to 2pm EDT), interested parties need to register by noon EDT on March 14 and deposit $200,000 with USMS (returnable to non-winning bidders).More information on this latest auction can be accessed via this link. "

Pixabay (Creative Commons). When I stopped mining for crypto coins ...","Jan 19, 2018,11:58am EST","Mining and cryptocurrency are dirty words to many of my readers. Extra dirty to people looking to build their own gaming PC in a retail landscape that's seen the prices of graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia inflate to atrocious levels. Seriously, it's now significantly cheaper to buy the majority of boutique or mass-market systems than it is to build them yourself. Perhaps it's not the right time to go DIY. Maybe you have no desire to assemble a crazy mining rig. But  for those of you with gaming PCs, you might be surprised how much money you can make mining with it, and how easy it is .","Use your existing gaming PC to make some extra Bitcoin, or extra cash.When I stopped mining for crypto coins back in 2013, getting a client up and running was a challenge. Basic knowledge of Linux and terminal commands were requirements. I'm dipping my toes back in these waters now, and I've found it's shockingly easy to get up and running on a Windows PC using software called NiceHash. No command lines, no messy configuration files -- although they're there if you need them. Just an installer, some quick auto-benchmarks, and then your GPU or CPU (or both) are putting their hashrates to work for you. The software even generates a Bitcoin wallet address for you.NiceHash makes it super simple to earn money mining with your existing gaming PC[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]3 Important Things About NiceHashBefore I get ahead of myself, let me lay down a few important comments. Don't skip these!First and most importantly, NiceHash does not actually use your PC's hardware to mine crypto coins like LiteCoin, Ethereum, or Monero directly. Instead, you're automatically selling your PC's hashing power to other miners who are mining those coins, effectively contributing to a pool's combined power. The reward? NiceHash pays you in Bitcoin at regular intervals. You can then transfer your earnings to an exchange like Coinbase and buy crypto coins if that's what you're after, or simply connect a bank account and cash out.The second thing is, for me, what makes NiceHash so appealing. Your hashrate -- or the power at which your GPU can mine -- is always being directed to what the most popular crypto coin is. It's completely hands-off. Before your first launch, the software will benchmark your hardware's hashrates for a variety of algorithms that correspond with those coins. Then at regular intervals it auto-switches to the most profitable one (to see these on your own, visit a site like WhatToMine.com). This means you're maximizing profit without needing to invest time in constant research or speculation.And the third thing: if you do want to get serious about mining, NiceHash may not be for you. Users can see higher hashrates and thus higher profits when doing things like flashing their GPU's BIOS, using command-line based clients, overclocking and undervolting, and installing alternate drivers like AMD's Blockchain Driver. But if you just want to click a button and start generating a profit, NiceHash is the easy button.How Much Can Your GPU Make?So, let's talk money. For the values below, I used the NiceHash Profitability Calculator and assumed a 0.10 USD/kWh electricity cost, meaning you're seeing profits after paying for the power consumption of that GPU. Your mileage may vary is an understatement here. The value of Bitcoin is in constant flux, and these calculations were based on a USD value of $11,655 on January 19. As the value of Bitcoin climbs, so do your potential profits. The reverse is of course true.All of the GPUs listed below were tested in the company's labs, and are pulled from actual profit numbers from users, not estimated ones. For my part, I can confirm the accuracy of the Radeon RX 580 and Nvidia GTX 1060 earnings.At time of publication, a GTX 1080 can earn up to $144/month miningMonthly profit for select Nvidia GeForce cards:Even a GTX 1060 3GB is a decent little miner while being incredibly power efficient. For those of you rocking something like a 1080? That's some awesome coin.AMD's Radeon Vega 64 GPU can make about $123.08 mining with NiceHashMonthly profit for select AMD Radeon cards:I included AMD's higher-end 7000 series cards here because they're not too shabby and tons of people still use them. As for AMD's latest Vega cards, they may chew through power, but they also spin a decent profit after the electricity bill gets paid.And a couple CPUs for good measure:Yes, you can actually use higher-end CPUs (expect a dollar or two per day max), but it will render your PC unusable for day-to-day tasks. And you can use NiceHash with your gaming laptop, though I caution against putting both your GPU and CPU to work simultaneously due to thermal and throttling concerns.Obviously these profit numbers will fluctuate for you, especially since you're probably going to use your rig and not dedicate it solely to mining. Then again, if you have a spare GPU you're not using, you can easily slot that into your PC and tell NiceHash to use that one and not your dedicated gaming GPU. Better to have it collecting Bitcoin than dust.At the very least, I believe the majority of people could be profiting enough to buy a new game every month.

[+] Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch),"In a recent interview with PayPal President and CEO Dan Schulman, PayPal Board Member and Xapo CEO Wences Casares shared his vision of a world where bitcoin becomes a global, apolitical standard of value.Casares is known as ""patient zero"" in terms of Silicon Valley’s interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology, but he thinks the road to success for Satoshi Nakamoto’s original creation may be much more boring than most of the people in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street would like to think. In the recent interview, Casares was also asked to compare Bitcoin with the distributed ledger technology (DLT) being worked on by major banks and the alternative public blockchains that compete with Bitcoin more directly.Bitcoin vs. Blockchain TechnologyAlthough it became somewhat fashionable for people to say that they’re interested in blockchain rather than bitcoin a couple of years ago, Casares believes this is an ignorant viewpoint to hold.“That shows quite a lot of ignorance about how the system works because that would be the equivalent of saying, ‘I like the web, but I don’t like the Internet,’” Casares told Schulman. “Well, the web doesn’t work without the Internet. The blockchain doesn’t exist without bitcoin.”Casares went on to explain that, in his view, the key, world-changing attribute of the Bitcoin blockchain is that it is no longer necessary to trust anyone else to verify the data held in a particular database. Instead, the level of trust in the data found in the blockchain exists on a spectrum related to the amount of work that has been expended on the verification of that data. In other words, a transaction gains more trust as it receives more confirmations from miners on the network.“A blockchain of four banks — it’s a database of four banks,” added Casares. “It’s nothing new. That’s not really a blockchain. A blockchain is something where you don’t have to trust any counterparty.”In Casares’s view, Bitcoin is the only blockchain working at scale in this manner, and that is due to the financial incentives around mining the bitcoin asset.The Incentives for Everyone to Build Around a Single BlockchainWhen asked about cryptoassets more generally, Casares was quick to point out that anyone making a prediction in this area is nothing more than a speculator.“I think that this is an experiment, and as such, nobody really knows what the outcome of the experiment [will be],” said Casares. “It will take a long time, and a lot of different things can happen.”In terms of his “best guess”, Casares analogized Bitcoin to the early days of the Internet. According to Casares, solid cases were made for the use of different Internet protocols for different use cases. For example, TCP/IP could be used for low-bandwidth applications (email for example), while X.25 could be used for something like Netflix.This is similar to how some people view Bitcoin as a network for digital gold today, while Ethereum is a network for smart contracts or Monero is a network for privacy-focused transactions.“Even though it made some engineering sense, it didn’t really make sense as a whole,” said Casares in terms of using different protocols for different use cases in the early days of the Internet. “There were huge incentives [around TCP/IP]. Today, the Internet won, and TCP/IP transports everything . . . Even things you never imagined — at some point, [started] being transported via TCP/IP.”To Casares’s point, layer-two networks on top of the base Bitcoin blockchain, such as the Lightning Network or sidechains, are intended to enable any value-related use of a blockchain. For example, RSK recently launched the beta version of an Ethereum-esque sidechain for Bitcoin (also see my post on the effect the Lightning Network may have on altcoins focused on low-value transactions).A counterpoint from advocates of alternative public blockchains would be that the security assumptions of sidechains are not well-tested at this point.From Casares’s perspective, the success of TCP/IP was due to the incentives for everyone to build around a single, robust protocol. In his view, the incentives around the use of one protocol for digital value transfer are even stronger.“There is a huge incentive to have one very, very robust blockchain,” said Casares. “At least for any process that, in the end, will be moving value of any kind.”If everyone built around the same blockchain, the amount of trust that can be placed upon that particular blockchain would increase due to the financial incentives in mining. Basically, the security of the Bitcoin blockchain would be much greater if alternative proof-of-work blockchains were ignored.In Casares’s view, there will be one blockchain that becomes the standard. This is similar to how there is one Internet and there are not separate networks at the base layer for Skype, web browsing, and every other Internet application.“I think we’re going to have one blockchain for value,” Casares continued. “There may be other use cases that do not entail value that may merit a different blockchain, but in terms of value, it’s most likely, in my opinion, that we’re going to have one. And right now, the most likely one seems to be the Bitcoin blockchain.”Casares then reiterated that this is a “highly speculative” viewpoint and Bitcoin is still an experiment. However, he indicated that there is a greater than 50% chance of success and roughly 20% chance of failure for Bitcoin during the opening portion of the interview.Casares added that there are a number of possible use cases of blockchains that may not have anything to do with the transfer of value, which leaves the door open for the existence of Bitcoin alternatives.The Boring Case for BitcoinWhile there is a large amount of excitement generated around Bitcoin in Silicon Valley and Wall Street, Casares is of the belief that the cryptoasset network’s road to success could be rather boring. Casares claimed that Silicon Valley is waiting on a killer app and Wall Street would like to see more use of the technology as a payments mechanism. However, the Xapo CEO can envision a world where neither of these scenarios play out and bitcoin still succeeds.“I can imagine a world in which neither one — in which they keep waiting and they never see the killer app and they never see payment adoption, yet bitcoin or cryptocurrencies win and people are forever late,” said Casares.In this hypothetical scenario, bitcoin would be used as a global standard of value that could be used to price every other asset in an apolitical manner. For example, fiat currencies would be quoted in bitcoin rather than other fiat currencies. Casares added that our children may one day wonder how assets were fairly priced in a world before bitcoin.“I can imagine a world in which bitcoin becomes a global standard of value — it’s the first global and non-political standard of value — coupled with the first global and non-political standard of settlement,” said Casares. “That would be super powerful. It doesn’t really need a killer application or much payment adoption to become that, but that would change the world as we know it. It would be the biggest leap forward in the democratization of money we’ve ever seen.”It could be argued that bitcoin’s role as an apolitical store of value was solidified by the abandonment of the SegWit2x hard fork proposal just days before it was supposed to activate. Ironically, Casares’s bitcoin wallet provider Xapo was a supporter of the New York Agreement, which was the basis for the SegWit2x proposal.Bitcoin most important quality is it's censorship resistance, the rest will follow. I got too impatient with 2x. Pictures also took too long to download in the early Internet, Bitcoin will eventually be able to process more payments.— Wences Casares (@wences) November 12, 2017Casares added that tracking the the success of Bitcoin may be a boring process, similar to tracking the adoption of email over time. There are simply more people using the protocol every year.“Success looks like more of the same,” said Casares after covering Bitcoin’s adoption metrics up to this point (Bitcoin enjoyed a tenfold increase in dollar-denominated transaction volume per day in 2017 alone).Update: This article was updated to include an embedded tweet from Casares where he discussed his impatience regarding a hard-forking increase to the block size limit, as outlined in the SegWit2x proposal."

[+] cryptocurrency and cybersecurity.,"Japan isn’t just the home of superstar all-girl idol bands like AKB48—it’s also the spiritual home of Bitcoin; Satoshi Nakamoto, the virtual currency’s creator used a Japanese name and the first successful bitcoin exchange, Mt.Gox, was founded in Tokyo. According to Japan's TBS News, over 30% of global bitcoin transactions are conducted in yen. It seemed only a matter of time before someone found a way to synergize bitcoin and all-girl idol bands, and this month the debut of Virtual Currency Girls (仮想通貨少女/kasoutsuka shojo) made it happen.The band was conceived and launched by talent management company Cinderella Academy (Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo). The Virtual Currency Girls are made up of eight female band members, aged between 15 and 22. Each girl, clad in a character mask, a frilly maid uniform and knee-socks, represents a virtual currency, such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and even Mona.Fans are expected to root for both the girls and/or the currency they represent. In their debut concert on January 12, the ostensible leader, 18-year old Rara Naruse (Bitcoin Cash), explained, “We want to enlighten Japan through entertainment about the possibilities of virtual currency. Cryptocurrencies are not just speculative investments but are really great technology that will change the future,"" she explained. However, onstage Rara had a bit of a catfight with the 16 year-old representative of Bitcoin, Hinano Shirahama. Ms. Shirahama (Bitcoin) insisted that Ms. Naruse (Bitcoin Cash) was a flash-in-the pan next to the older and more revered original Bitcoin. Rara was insistent that she, or rather her currency, was the future. No one appeared to win the fight but the audience was amused.While the dialogue and on-stage banter may seem silly, the girls have all studied up on the virtual currencies they represent; they can explain them succinctly and in ways that are more informative than many long-winded books. Hinata Kozuki (Ripple), a 15-year-old who lives in Aomori Prefecture, spends four hours on the train to get to band practice in Tokyo on the weekends. “I picked Ripple because when you send virtual currency, it supposedly arrives the fastest. If I really was Ripple, band practice would be a lot less tiring,"" she said.In song, dance, and in candid talks, each of the eight girls who make up the band extol the virtues... [+] of the virtual currency they represent.Their debut song, ""The Moon And Virtual Currencies And Me,"" is a catchy tune but also a cautionary one. It warns the public to avoid fraudulent virtual currency operators, and lock down their cyber security. It’s also a meditation on making and losing huge sums of real money by investing in cryptocurrency.Related: An ICO Ban In Japan Is Still A 'Definite Possibility'The band members sing as well as any Japanese teen-idol band, and there is certainly something charming about eight teenagers shouting a chorus of virtual currency names, pronounced with a Japanese accent: “NEMU! NEO! MONA! EIDA! RIPPURU! BITTO! IISSA!” Virtual Currency Girls have a CD for sale but it can only be purchased with cryptocurrency.It takes some decoding but any cybercurrency fan can figure out the lyrics if they listen closely.  There are also references to the smallest unit of Bitcoin, a Satoshi, and other obscure terms that should inspire study amongst their fans.The song ends with a prophecy and a warning, which loosely translated goes like this:""Paper [money] is over. It’s the digital age… Also are you thinking about taxes [on your earnings]… You put better some away. If you forget, the tax office will come for you someday!""It’s hard to find fault with a band that warns you about cybersecurity and the need to pay your taxes, while dancing and smiling at the same time. With less than a month in existence it is not clear whether this band will be a hit or a miss, but at the moment they seem to be gaining traction. They have a song, and of course, they have merchandise. In keeping with the theme, Virtual Currency Girls' goods, can only be purchased in cryptocurrency. Cash, in principle, is not accepted.The appearance of such a band shouldn't be that surprising. Japan has been very friendly towards cryptocurrency; it recognized bitcoin as legal tender in April last year. In September, the Financial Services Agency officially recognized 11 companies as legal cryptocurrency exchange operators.More on Forbes: Japan: A Forward Thinking Bitcoin Nation"

dollars or where customers sent/received coins from another bitcoin ...","Jan 10, 2018,04:28pm EST","As the number and variety of cryptocurrencies on the market continue to grow, so does the scrutiny by government regulators.  As noted in my prior post, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission have developed units focused on cyber-threats, as have numerous foreign governments.  Most recently, the Internal Revenue Service has joined the mix by investigating the ways in which taxpayers do – and more importantly, do not – report virtual currency transactions.  Now Congress has gotten in on the action by amending the tax code to close a loophole that allowed cryptocurrency owners to exchange digital currencies without reporting the transactions on their tax returns.  2018 is likely to be a year of uncertainty for owners of cryptocurrencies, which may account in part for the double digit decline in the value of Bitcoins at the end of December.","After announcing initiatives aimed at addressing misconduct in the cyber world, in December 2017, the relatively new Cyber Unit of the SEC brought its first enforcement action related to the sale of cryptocurrency through an initial coin offering (“ICO”).  In the lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Dominic Lacroix, described by the government as a “recidivist securities law violator,” had undertaken a cryptocurrency ICO that fraudulently raised approximately $15 million from investors by falsely promising a 13-fold profit in less than a month.  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest and penalties and bars from practice for Lacroix.  According to Robert Cohen, Chief of the Cyber Unit, “This first Cyber Unit case hits all of the characteristics of a full-fledged cyber scam and is exactly the kind of misconduct the unit will be pursuing.  We acted quickly to protect retail investors from this initial coin offering's false promises.”The IRS also has initiated cryptocurrency-related litigation, filing a lawsuit in federal district court in San Francisco in March 2017 to obtain customer data, including customer accounts and transaction records, from Coinbase.  Coinbase, a popular service for buying and selling bitcoins which – on a side note – recently announced that it was conducting an internal investigation into possible insider trading of Bitcoin Cash by its employees, refused to comply with the government’s summons claiming it was illegally broad.Initially, the IRS sought records related to all of Coinbase’s more than one million customers.  Its demand subsequently was limited to those accounts that conducted bitcoin transactions worth $20,000 or more, which applied to approximately 8.9 million transactions conducted by more than 14,000 Coinbase customers.  The information sought all transactions where bitcoins were exchanged for dollars or where customers sent/received coins from another bitcoin user.  In November 2017, United States Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Corley, sitting in the Northern District of California, ruled in favor of the IRS, finding that the narrowed summons “serves the IRS’s legitimate purpose of investigating Coinbase account holders who may not have paid federal taxes on their virtual currency profits.”BitcoinMagistrate Judge Corley ordered Coinbase to turn over the taxpayer ID number, name, date of birth, address, records of account activity and periodic statements of accounts in response to the subpoena, but found that the IRS’s request for account opening records, copies of passports or driver’s licenses, all wallet addresses, and all public keys for all accounts/wallets/vaults were not relevant at this stage of the government’s investigation.The order covers the period from 2013 to 2015.  Papers filed during the litigation revealed that the IRS’s investigation was prompted by the agency’s discovery that in those years, less than 900 individuals per year declared bitcoin related losses or gains despite the fact that the value of virtual currency soared from $13 to $1,100 during the same period.  Since then, digital currencies, which offer a low-cost alternative to using banks, money transfer companies or brokers that charge hefty fees, have continued to explode.  In 2017, trading of cryptocurrencies posted record numbers – over $10 billion – in trading volume.The decision in the Coinbase case is particularly relevant given provisions included in the controversial 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that amend the tax code’s rules regarding “like kind exchanges.”  Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows taxpayers to postpone the recognition of capital gains or losses for “like kind exchanges.”   To qualify as “like kind,” both properties must be similar in nature, character or class.  For example, real property and personal property can qualify, as long as they are exchanged for similar real or personal property.  The statute explicitly excludes stocks, bonds, or notes, and other securities or debt.The massive tax reform enacted by Congress at the end of 2017 tweaked Section 1031 to replace the word “property” with “real property,” thereby limiting the “like kind exchange” exception to apply only to real estate transactions.  Cryptocurrency owners who seek to diversify their holdings by exchanging one type of cryptocurrency for another must now report the tax consequences.  This amendment, coupled with the IRS’s victory in the Coinbase case is likely to lead the agency to cast a wider net to gather information from other companies that facilitate cryptocurrency transactions.Market reports as recent as last week stated that the preeminent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is the weakest it has ever been.  Simultaneously, analysts were predicting that 2018 will be the first year that central banks begin to hold digital currencies among their assets as a nod to the fact that cryptocurrencies are here to stay.  Although the future of cryptocurrencies may be unclear, increased government regulation and involvement in cryptocurrencies is a certainty.To read more from Robert J.

[+] parliament house, in New Delhi, India, in New Delhi, India, Thursday, Feb. 1, 2018. Jaitley is expected to announce populist giveaways in an attempt to woo voters as this is the last budget of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government which will seek a second five-year tenure in May 2019 national elections. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)According to a transcript of the speech by The Hindu, Jaitley expressed skepticism of cryptocurrencies while more broadly applauding blockchain technology.
Distributed ledger system or the block chain technology allows organization of any chain of records or transactions without the need of intermediaries. The Government does not consider crypto-currencies legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate use of these crypto-assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system. The Government will explore use of block chain technology proactively for ushering in digital economy.This follows other negative comments and public warnings Jaitley has made about cryptocurrencies, such as his comments in a December notice that warned Indian citizens:There is a real and heightened risk of investment bubble of the type seen in ponzi schemes which can result in sudden and prolonged crash exposing investors, especially retail consumers losing their hard-earned money. Consumers need to be alert and extremely cautious as to avoid getting trapped in such Ponzi schemes.If these recent comments truly spell the end of legal cryptocurrency trading in India, that marks a major blow for the cryptocurrency world; the country currently accounts for 10 percent of all bitcoin transactions, reporting record numbers in recent months.Amid the media storm, William Suberg of CoinTelegraph has noted that this is a case of misinterpreting words and corollary action:India’s central bank has issued repeated warnings on cryptocurrency investment, some of which appeared tantamount to calling it illegal.... While Jaitley’s speech noticeably avoided any mention of legality of crypto in and of itself, commentaries by third parties and mainstream media journalists controversially claimed that a ban was imminent.Whatever the case, as India gears up for election season next May, it appears that the issue of cryptocurrency legality will be playing a role in the public discourse.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated.

Another platform called Ethereum, that also uses blockchain, is predicted by some experts to overtake Bitcoin this year.","AdobeStockWhat is Ethereum?Ethereum is an open-source public service that uses blockchain technology to facilitate smart contracts and cryptocurrency trading securely without a third party. There are two accounts available through Ethereum: externally owned accounts (controlled by private keys influenced by human users) and contract accounts. Ethereum allows developers to deploy all kinds of decentralized apps. Even though Bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, it’s Ethereum’s aggressive growth that has many speculating it will soon overtake Bitcoin in usage.How is Ethereum different than Bitcoin?While there are many similarities between Ethereum and Bitcoin, there are also significant differences. Here are a few:What are the advantages of Ethereum?Proponents of Ethereum believe its main advantage over Bitcoin is that it allows individuals and companies to do much more than just transfer money between entities leading Bloomberg to write it’s “the hottest platform in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains” and companies such as JPMorgan Chase, Intel and Microsoft to invest in it.History of EthereumEthereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin said, “I thought [those in the Bitcoin community] weren’t approaching the problem in the right way. I thought they were going after individual applications; they were trying to kind of explicitly support each [use case] in a sort of Swiss Army knife protocol.”He envisioned a different way.Buterin was introduced and intrigued by blockchain technology when he got involved in Bitcoin as a 17-year-old programmer in 2011 and co-founded Bitcoin Magazine. He started to imagine a platform that went beyond the financial use cases allowed by Bitcoin and released a white paper in 2013 describing what would ultimately become Ethereum using a general scripting language.The key differentiator from Bitcoin was the platform’s ability to trade more than just cryptocurrency.In 2014, Buterin and the other co-founders of Ethereum launched a crowdsourcing campaign where they sold participants Ether (Ethereum tokens) to get their vision off the ground and raised more than $18 million. The first live release of Ethereum known as Frontier was launched in 2015. Since then, the platform has grown rapidly and today there are hundreds of developers involved.Ultimately, Buterin hopes Ethereum will be the solution for all use cases of blockchain that don’t have a specialized system to turn to.Ethereum is still experiencing growing pains and suffers from some of the same issues that Bitcoin does primarily in its scalability. In 2016, $50 million in Ether was stolen by an anonymous hacker which resulted in questions about the platform’s security. This caused a split within the Ethereum community and it broke off into two blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).There have been dramatic fluctuations in the price of Ether, but the Ethereum currency grew more than 13,000 percent in 2017. This tremendous growth is attractive to many investors, but the volatility makes other investors cautious.It’s still a very young platform, but its potential and applications could be limitless. Ethereum’s infrastructure was enhanced over the last few years when it was challenged with security issues and since it’s less monopolistic than Bitcoin, it is more open to reform measures that might ultimately make it a superior solution to Bitcoin."

As more people adopt new ways of transferring value, markets of all types are being disrupted. The adoption of blockchain technology and the innovative products built on top of it, namely digital assets or cryptocurrencies and similar value-exchange mechanisms, are gearing towards dramatically changing how we transact in our day-to-day life. Disrupting the entire financial industry is already a major effect of the rise of cryptocurrencies, but it is not the only industry that this phenomenon will affect.","A multitude of industries are being rewritten and new ones are being created every day. Cryptocurrencies are having a direct and indirect impact on people, organizations and countries all over the world. Take for instance Ivan Liljeqvist, a Software Developer from Stockholm, Sweden and founder of Ivan on Tech, a YouTube channel that informs users about cryptocurrencies and tries to breach the gap between the expert and the average user. Ivan produces videos explaining to the average user the advantages and disadvantages of certain cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology. Ivan’s channel grew from 4,000 to over 100,000 subscribers in just a few months, a major increase (+2,500%) and an example of how the ripple effect of cryptocurrencies benefit not only those who hold the digital asset, but content creators as well. As a technology content creator focused on blockchain, cryptocurrencies and similar technologies, he is able to help those who want to take a part in the cryptocurrency phenomenon but simply do not know where to start. Ivan now travels all around the world speaking at conferences about the importance of understanding these disruptive technologies. Because of his channel’s popularity, he is now exploring new verticals and coming up with new ways to help those wanting to understand all of the recent buzz.Media coverage is one of the reasons why cryptocurrencies have reached their popularity. When Bitcoin was created in 2009, only those close to the project were able to participate in the network. Most people were not aware of its existence until it received media attention and information about this disruptive technology began to emerge. As the average user tuned in to learn all about Bitcoin from their preferred media outlet, we began to see an exponential increase in the value of Bitcoin, as people eager to be a part of this new technology began to join the network. New exchanges were created for people to trade their local currency for cryptocurrencies, and information began to spread on social media and the press. Today, the spotlight is on the incredible increase in the value of Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. Information both vilifying and praising these technologies make headlines around the world, and skeptics and lovers share their thoughts on social networks. Content creators need to be careful when releasing information about cryptocurrencies, as we have seen that these could have major effects on an already volatile market. Rightfully, information is crucial when it comes to breaching the gap between the expert and the average user trying to be a part of this global phenomenon.Breaching the gap and helping people join this phenomenon is just the start. If cryptocurrencies are here to stay, we need to make sure everyone is able to participate. By having a healthy community around various cryptocurrencies, we can ensure that the future of these technologies is in the hands of the majority of the global population. Once everyone in the world is able to take advantage of these breakthroughs, we will see new businesses flourish and new opportunities arise­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­–and we are already seeing that occur. Decentralized networks like the Bitcoin network can be used by people anywhere in the world to transact with one another, and decentralized applications can be built on top of Ethereum or EOS to allow for more scalable and independent products. It should not be a surprise that these technologies will have a major economic impact in developing countries, as they become the alternative to an otherwise polluted, expensive and inefficient system.In Zimbabwe for instance, Bitcoin is trading at above average prices, as the demand for the digital currency is ever-increasing. It is also the case that decentralization is not always required. Ripple Labs for example, a company who claims to have the fastest and most scalable digital asset (XRP) has been under fire recently due to concerns that they control most of their digital asset. Although controversial, companies like Ripple are also set to change the world dramatically, as they allow for faster settlement across ledgers and connect financial institutions all over the world. This will mean that countries that would otherwise go through various expensive routes to send money across international borders will be able to trade at a lower cost and more efficiently. There is no “one size fits all” in cryptocurrencies, as the use cases of some cryptocurrencies benefit some users more than others, but the options are there for those who want to take advantage of them.
Cryptocurrencies are not only changing how we transact, but also how we store value for the long-term and conduct business. In the traditional sense, for example, people would have a bank account to store some of their money, and companies would offer cards for medical expenses and other types of accounts to save for retirement. This can all change as people move their assets to digital formats, and store them in distinct wallets distributed across multiple places. These changes are already seen in governments across the globe as countries explore ways to digitize their own currency. You may soon find that your parking meter no longer accepts physical coins, but digital tokens that you can purchase online. Small businesses may also choose to transact with cryptocurrencies, as they will be able to do this cheaply and fast. It is not far-fetched that we could see companies as large as Uber be replaced by decentralized autonomous organizations that run on smart contracts. Smart contracts can be programmed to perform many of the tasks traditional organizations perform, but more efficiently and open, and they use digital tokens to transact. These changes are not only limited to a specific type of organization or even a country, they can resonate all around the world, from a small tourism company giving tours of the Amazon River to the tech startup in Silicon Valley or Singapore. These changes to how traditional organizations and businesses operate is yet another of the ripple effects of cryptocurrencies.Disruptive technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies are able to rewrite our day-to-day life. The effect of cryptocurrencies is seen not only in the financial industry, but in various markets all across the world. Cryptocurrencies and related technologies can have direct and indirect effects on a personal, organizational and geographical level. Their effects can reach anyone, from content creators, to small companies in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, to entire countries. It is this wide spectrum of impact what powers new businesses and opportunities, the seemingly unlimited potential of how markets are being rewritten by these technologies. As more people realize their potential, and as new users are able to participate in the various networks, the ripple effect of cryptocurrencies will reach every corner of the world.DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, PLEASE CONSULT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR BEFORE INVESTING IN ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY.

Collaborative consumption. What all of these terms have in common is the idea of decentralization — and blockchain applications, including bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, are just the latest in a trend toward this new economic paradigm.If it’s unclear what decentralization means, consider the following visual. You might have seen one like it before. On the left is a representation of a centralized, top-down system. Think of a traditional corporation, one that has only one CEO and one head office.Are we headed for a new economic paradigm?Now compare that to the next two visuals depicting decentralized and distributed systems. Instead of being top-down, their infrastructures are more collaborative, helping to prevent systemic failure, collusion and more.This is the “sharing economy” business model that’s growing in prominence thanks to the internet and practiced by companies such as Facebook, Airbnb, Uber and more. Although these firms have one CEO and headquarters like a more traditional company, their assets are decentralized and widely distributed: Facebook’s content is collaborative among 2 billion users worldwide. Airbnb and Uber’s hotels and cabs are privately owned. Jack Ma’s Alibaba has no inventory of its own, relying instead on a decentralized network of retailers and manufacturers.Blockchain, and bitcoin specifically, is the logical conclusion to this trend. Bitcoin is completely open-source and peer-to-peer. No one owns it. Unlike fiat currencies, it’s not controlled or regulated by a central authority. This is possible only through the power of blockchain, the decentralized, unmodifiable electronic ledger that records all activity across the entire system.We’re in the very early stages of this new paradigm, but already much is expected. Mastercard believes the sharing economy will inevitably graduate beyond social media and accommodations, spreading “into new sectors, including insurance, utilities, health and social care.” And UBS estimates that by 2027, blockchain could add between $300 and $400 billion of annual economic value to the global economy.Indeed, something interesting is happening.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

Nor can taxpayers pay their taxes with loose diamonds even though, they, too, have value. And typically, most taxpayers can't pay in Botswana pulas or Russian rubles either. So what can you use? Let's take a look.By law, at 31 U.S.C. 5103, you can pay your taxes using U.S. money:United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.It's worth noting that law is found at Title 31 (Money and Finance), and not Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code). That's because not all laws which affect your taxes are specific to the Tax Code. Since Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is an arm of the federal government, it is also subject to other regulations like this one from the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS) which confirmed that IRS would no longer accept checks for $100 million or more.But even when an issue is directly related to IRS, you won't necessarily find a corresponding provision in the Tax Code. Consider the issue of paying in foreign currency, for example. On the IRS website, it notes that ""Payments of U.S. tax must be remitted to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in U.S. dollars"" - even for foreign electronic payments.  But if you check the Tax Code, you won't find specific language requiring that those taxes be paid in U.S. dollars, just like there's nothing in the Code that says no to payments of bitcoin or loose diamonds. Here's what the Code actually says (section 6311):It shall be lawful for the Secretary to receive for internal revenue taxes (or in payment for internal revenue stamps) any commercially acceptable means that the Secretary deems appropriate to the extent and under the conditions provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary.That's a fancy way of saying that the IRS will issue Regulations (interpretations of the tax code) and other guidance about the kinds of payment which can be used to pay your taxes so long it doesn't run afoul of other rules. And the IRS has done so, authorizing, for example, payment by check, money order, credit card and debit card. (You can find more ways to pay your tax bill to IRS here.)What about other forms of payment? Paying in foreign currency has been addressed - it's allowed under limited circumstances. But paying in bitcoin (or loose diamonds) has not specifically been authorized, and even if you wanted to argue that the specific omission of bitcoin or loose diamonds shouldn't preclude using those as payment for taxes, you'd likely lose under a statutory interpretation of what's considered ""commercially acceptable.""That said, if you really had your heart set on paying your taxes in bitcoin, you could investigate using a third party. Bitcoin-based shopping cart Snapcard tried its hand at it in 2014 with a service that allowed customers to pay the IRS. The service Snapcard worked like a payment processor (think MasterCard) and processing fees applied. However, Snapcard has since repivoted and launched a product in 2015 called ""Masspay"" that became Wyre. According to a spokesperson from the company, ""Paying the IRS with bitcoin is something that we're not offering at the moment.""Of course, just because IRS doesn't accept cryptocurrency like bitcoin as direct payment today doesn't mean that will always be the case. A bill to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes was ultimately voted down, 264 to 74, by the New Hampshire legislature in 2016: The state was angling to be the first in the country to accept bitcoin as payment for taxes. A similar measure in Utah also failed to pass. However, states are still trying: Arizona introduced a crypto payment measure just this year. I suspect it's just a matter of time before we see some changes.(Author's note: An email to IRS asking whether there were any plans in the near future to accept bitcoin as payment was not immediately returned.)--Before you go: be sure to read my disclaimer. Remember, I’m a lawyer and we love disclaimers.If you have a question, here's how to ""ask the taxgirl."""

Beyond the noise and hum, we are just barely scratching the surface of uses for the underlying technology, blockchain. The opportunity for retailers is really interesting. Blockchain in the supply chain is one useful tool. Customer engagement is the bigger opportunity.","I was a CIO in Boston during the heady days of the dot-com expansion. I heard stories of VC companies pestering their new start-ups...”Have you used up the $25 million I gave you yet?” and wondered what the heck they were thinking.  I also knew I was missing something. I wanted in, but a CIO was not desirable in the dot-com space at that time. CTO’s were the rage.Certainly, we can say that over the past twenty years, the world of the internet has stabilized. Particularly in the world of retail, digital channels are generally a part of a retailers’ overall strategy.  And as an excellent recent New York Times article argues, while the open protocols underpinning the internet still exist, at the next layer, proprietary protocols and standards have filled any gaps in the original standard. So Facebook, with more than two billion users, has become a de facto personal identity standard. LinkedIn aspires to be the de facto business identity standard. And Amazon, well…you know. It would like to rule the commerce world entirely.So, in many ways, aspects of what was meant to be standard and widespread have become consolidated and proprietary. As such, they are also open to attack and/or coopting, as Facebook apparently was, by foreign agents seeking to influence the US elections. This has proven to be more than a little problematic.The world is changing again. This past week in Miami, I think I got a sniff into what I missed in the 1990’s, as I found myself in the middle of a feeding frenzy, the North American Bitcoin Conference, now a part of the World Blockchain Forum, Investments and ICO’s. For the uninitiated, an ICO is an “Initial Coin Offering.”  There were a lot of ICO offerings in the midst of the speeches, and truly, Venture Capitalists were panting over the possibilities. I was sitting at one booth where quite literally, a Venture Capitalist introduced himself as such and basically said “I want in.  Who do I give my money to?”I should mention four years ago I went to the Bitcoin conference in Miami, and it was not part of anything else. It also was attended by about 600 people (mostly young guys), in a very warm room upstairs from the Miami Beach Convention Center. The Bitcoin was worth $600 a coin at that time.  This year’s conference filled the 4,600 seat James L. Knight Center in downtown Miami and additionally filled about 50,000 square feet of exhibit space (all booths were 10*10, for reference). It's true that after a crazy ride, the Bitcoin is settling in at around $11,000 per coin, but that no way dampened enthusiasm. The event is still not NRF Big Show size, but it’s pretty big, and the investment money was flowing like water.In fact, the Bitcoin conference re-branded as a part of the World Blockchain Forum actually tells you a lot. Behind the noise, blockchain is the crown jewel of this new era. So while the world at large is focused on Bitcoin’s wild valuation swings, and no less than Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase’s announcement that he regrets calling Bitcoin a fraud, they might miss the second part of his statement, “The blockchain is real,” and they miss the way dollars and fiat currencies in all flavors are flowing into blockchain-based start-ups. In fact, J.P Morgan Chase announced a blockchain based system last October that will significantly reduce the number of parties needed to verify global payments, reducing transaction times from weeks to hours (and no doubt making their transactions more profitable).IBM has thrown money behind blockchain, so has JDA. But there are boatloads of start-ups out there, and there is a lot of work to be done, particularly on the ledger’s ability to process a lot of transactions at the same time (scale).Blockchain is distributed, which is to say it is replicated in multiple locations around the world, and activity/transactions are irrevocable. The distributed aspect has both positive and negative implications. Because the entire chain is distributed (i.e. lives in more than one place), it has latency built in.  That is to say that it takes time to replicate transactions into every blockchain ledger around the world. That’s the downside. But because it is distributed, it is also hard to destroy, just like the internet. Just as the internet was original designed by the defense department to avoid single points of failure, a blockchain is hard to destroy.Because transactions are irrevocable, debates about who did what to whom, when, tend to disappear. It is meant to be the true “permanent record.” As such, it is designed for exchanges between parties that do not trust each other and who would be happy to be anonymous.Now that I’ve presented this probably overlong explanation of blockchain, I want to describe one blockchain-based retail application that could solve a somewhat intractable problem: the desire for consumers to experience more personalized offers from retailers, coupled with their desire to maintain their privacy. In other words, I'm talking about customer engagement. By all accounts, personalization is a Holy Grail in retail. Today’s consumer simply doesn’t want to see extraneous “stuff.” She wants to see things that are relevant to her lifestyle, budget and overall tastes. But she’s not keen to “open the kimono” and let you know everything about her.Enter Shopin. It’s early stage, and just now took its Initial Coin Offering live. It is actually being called a “private token pre-sale.”  The concept is simple.I spoke with Shopin’s Blockchain Technology Officer, Jeremy Harkness, at the show. Shopin has modified blockchain to have qualities of both a ledger (the original blockchain design), and a database.  It is built on Ethereum, which appears to be the most widely used blockchain implementation (with an associated cryptocurrency, of course). According to Harkness, Shopin’s implementation can process millions of transactions. They have clocked it at between one million and two million transactions per second, so it should be adequate for retailers. It's an interesting concept.The consumer owns the key to her data and can permission it out if she wants to. If she agrees to permission it out (and she could theoretically be given Shopin tokens by the retailer for doing so), the retailer is given anonymized information so it can understand the shoppers needs and wants. The technology will include a bit of Artificial Intelligence (AI), so that it can match up what a retailer has available for sale with the shopper’s tastes. At any point along the way, a Shopin token can be exchanged either as a reward or as an incentive.The retailer only sees what the AI engine’s recommendation is, based on what’s in stock vs. what the customer’s past purchase history is. Privacy is maintained, relevancy is achieved.Shopin also plans to include a wallet, which would give the consumer a single sign on and one click checkout.  Two-factor authentication is included to help insure privacy and accuracy.I initially had some concerns about data accuracy, since having looked at Acxiom’s aboutthedata.com I discovered numerous errors in their recording of my tastes. I also know a core tenet of blockchain is irrevocability. However, I would later see from looking at Shopin’s web site, that they plan to allow the consumer to pre-enter her own tastes along with reviewing previous purchase data passed into the system. In other words, the consumer is in control, and the retailer can respond accordingly.This is an interesting way to get to personalization without sacrificing privacy. It’s important because notwithstanding continual statements that “Millennials don’t care about their privacy,” most studies seem to tell us that they certainly do. Really, what they want is control.Shopin isn’t fully ready for prime time, but it does give you a taste of the possibilities. Couple with that some of the core tenets of blockchain: distributed data, knowing no geographic borders or fees and fundamentally almost impossible to hack and it starts to become intriguing.Long story short, blockchain offers a lot of possibilities to fulfill the original promise of the internet. It beats back arbitrary geographic and political boundaries, so it is of great interest to populists and anarchists alike. It’s private, safe and in no one individual’s control.  The promise is huge."

[+] Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images),"The concept of blockchain as a standalone technology started gaining popularity in 2015. Prior to that, it was just known as a data structure underlying Bitcoin technology. In Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper, the two words “block” and “chain” appeared together. It was only called “a chain of blocks.”Bitcoin’s rise into popularity resulted in it being categorized as Blockchain 1.0. With Ethereum making waves as a decentralized platform for applications that run exactly as programmed, more and more people began to categorize Ethereum as Blockchain 2.0. Now the market is battling to see who will be named Blockchain 3.0. Direct Acyclic Graph or DAG may be it.What is DAG?DAG is a directed graph data structure that uses a topological ordering. The sequence can only go from earlier to later. DAG is often applied to problems related to data processing, scheduling, finding the best route in navigation, and data compression.Bitcoin Blockchain Storage StructureBitcoin has always been inefficient due to the proof-of-work (POW) system. Blocks can’t be created simultaneously. The linked storage structure allows for only one chain on the whole network. All the transactions occurring around the same time are kept in the same block. Miners then compete for the block validation. One single block is created about every 10 minutes.The first community to come up with the idea of changing the chain-like storage structure into a DAG of blocks was NXT. If the time of mining remains unchanged, the storage could be extended by X times with X blocks on the network at the same time.DAG of Blocks StructureThe blockchain combination with DAG still comes from the idea of side-chains. Different types of transactions are running on different chains simultaneously. DAG of blocks still relies on the concept of blocks.IoT Chain (ITC), IOTA, and Byteball are the blockless projects currently shining in the market. With Bitcoin or Ethereum, the block creation speed is a bottleneck. Bitcoin generates a new block every 10 minutes. Ethereum is better, but it takes around 15-20 seconds for block validation. But why do we even need a block? On the bitcoin network, many transactions are mined into blocks and the transaction sequence is maintained by the prehashes between blocks. What if you combine blocks and transactions together? Make every transaction directly involved in maintaining the sequences. After the transaction is placed, you can skip the process of mining. This makes it blockless and more efficient. Concepts in the DAG BlockchainThe Double-Spending Issue, from a Probabilistic PerspectiveThe Bitcoin network uses the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) model. Users are only allowed to have one transaction placement under their UTXO. There might be more than one miner who solves the hash function at the same time to acquire the right of block validation. This might develop forks temporarily. The validation of a certain transaction is decided by the number of transactions behind it. The rate of transactions coming back into the network is lower with more transactions behind it, which makes the transaction safer.The Width of the NetworkWhen each transaction is validated, it needs to be linked to an existing and relatively new transaction on the DAG network. If it links to earlier transactions every time, it would make the network too wide to validate the new transactions. Ideally, the DAG network chooses an existing later transaction to link to when a new transaction happens. The goal is to keep the network width within a certain range that can support quick transaction validation. IOTA also proposed its own algorithm controlling the width on the tangle network.Quick TransactionsDue to its blockless nature, the transactions run directly into the DAG networks. The whole process is much faster than those of blockchains based on PoW and PoS. No Mining InvolvedThere are no miners on DAG networks. The validation of transactions goes directly to the transactions themselves. For users, this means transactions go through almost instantly. Friendly to Small PaymentsWith the advancement of DAG, we’re looking at a future where high functioning and minimum transaction fee chains are possible. That means users can send micro-payments without heavy fees like Bitcoin or Ethereum.One project in China looks to be taking a serious swing at being the leader in this space. IoT Chain (ITC) is built on DAG and can handle over 10,000 transactions per second. It has a strong vision, strong community, and is backed by leading blockchain funds like ChainFunder and FBG. IoT Chain has a solid shot at becoming categorized as Blockchain 3.0.DAG will be used for applications that require scalability in the thousands of transactions per second. The launch of CryptoKitties clogged the Ethereum network which resulted in slow transactions and high fees. Ethereum has a solution to this called sharding, but it is 5 years out. Applications will soon, I think, be turning to DAG to scale."

But for some reason, all of this buzz about cryptocurrency really has my attention.Some call cryptocurrency the “digital gold rush,” magnetizing thousands around the world to invest in digital currencies like Bitcoin and other alternative coins like Litecoin and TRON. Although skeptics have their concerns, there’s no denying cryptocurrency has an exponential growth trend that appears to be steadily rising.For millennials, cryptocurrency could be the investment opportunity of a lifetime. Not to mention, it’s ushering in a tidal wave of technological innovation. The biggest barrier to entry for most? Decoding all of that tech jargon. It’s about time someone explained cryptocurrency to you in a language you can actually understand. That’s why I’ve just launched one of the world’s first online crypto and blockchain summits, where 21 industry-leading experts will be sharing everything you need to know about cryptocurrency over the course of three days.This week on the Unconventional Life Podcast, I spoke with a cryptocurrency geek who’s done all of the heavy lifting for you. Meet Michael Graziano, the founder of Global Degree, one of the largest online communities for millennial travelers worldwide. He’s racing to become the youngest North American male to visit all 193 countries in the world, documenting all of his adventures online. Across his social channels, and including collaborations with Discovery Channel and MTV, Graziano has a combined reach of 50 million+. “I’ve been to over 100 different countries and seen all different types of economies, people, and ways of life. Some of these countries’ databases are incredibly inefficient and outdated. Can you imagine what the world will look like when everyone’s on one database?” Graziano says. Enter the blockchain. If you don’t yet know what that is, don’t sweat it—below, I’ve transcribed my Q&A with Graziano where he breaks down the fundamentals of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and more, so you can finally get up to speed on everything crypto.Jules Schroeder: What is blockchain?Michael Graziano: A blockchain is a global online database that anyone, anywhere, with an internet connection, can use. The cool thing is traditional databases are owned by a central authority like banks, companies, or governments, but blockchain isn’t owned by anyone. It has a peer-to-peer network looking after it, so cheating the system is nearly impossible. Blockchain stores information permanently across a network of personal computers, which decentralizes, distributes, and records it onto a public ledger that anyone can see. The transactions are verified by miners, who maintain the ledger. These bundles of records on personal computers are called blocks. Each block has a timestamp, and a form to a previous block, forming a chronological chain.Schroeder: What is Bitcoin?Graziano: Bitcoin is blockchain’s first and most widely known application.. People send Bitcoin freely to each other, and blockchain comes in to verify that only one person claims to own each coin at one time.Schroeder: How are businesses and governments reacting to cryptocurrency?Graziano: Big players like eBay, Microsoft, Expedia, McDonald’s and Subway are all starting to accept Bitcoin and other digital currencies. The Swiss government is accepting Bitcoin for tax payments. Dubai has announced that they want to become the world’s first ‘blockchain city.’ These are major statements from major economies… all of this is happening so fast and I expect these changes to really amplify in 2018.Schroeder: What will change in the future with everyone using these blockchain technologies?Graziano: When it all boils down, blockchain allows us all to share a single source of truth. Take the sharing economy, for example, which has given rise to Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, etc. These companies have profited on the idea of a sharing economy, but instead of sharing, they’ve acquired or eliminated competitors and collected all the profits. Where blockchain could step in is to create a public marketplace where people can share cars, homes, or whatever, with no intermediary. Another application is the recapturing of our identities. The most powerful asset of the digital age is data. Perhaps more valuable than money, land, or anything else you own. Everywhere you go and everything you do online is recorded. It creates a virtual you. But the biggest problem is that you don’t own the virtual you. It’s owned and exchanged by big companies like Google. Blockchain is one new technology that will allow you to have privacy and to monetize and control where your information goes.Schroeder: So what are some of the top cryptocurrencies to look out for in 2018?Graziano: I encourage people interested to do your research, but here are five projects that I think have a lot of potential: Skycoin, which has the ability to give each company or application their own blockchain, helping to combat high traffic and loading times with no transaction fees. Xaurum, the only cryptocurrency backed by gold, which provides intrinsic value and makes growth much more secure with less volatility. Stratis, a blockchain development platform that allows people to create custom uses for blockchains that haven’t even been thought of yet. Shift, another alternative blockchain that includes peer-to-peer storage, an uncensorable internet, and seamless monetization removing the need for third parties like Facebook or Youtube for content creators. Then there’s DOVU, which is embracing the emerging smart car industry where cars are predicted to generate up to 25GB of data per hour. With DOVU you can manage and sell your car’s data at your discretion in exchange for tokens.Disclaimer: the opinions expressed in this article are not intended to replace the advice of an investment advisor.

Robinhood ...","Jan 25, 2018,11:01am EST",Robinhood Crypto,"Since launching in 2015, online brokerage platform Robinhood has become a staple among millennials diving into U.S. equity markets via smartphones, and more recently, web browsers. Now, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm is moving into the crypto market after announcing Thursday that it’ll start offering Bitcoin and Ethereum trading next month.Robinhood Crypto will launch in February to consumers in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana and New Hampshire. Starting Thursday, anybody in the U.S. with Robinhood’s iOS or Android mobile apps will be able to track market data, read news and set price alerts for a roster of 16 cryptocurrencies that include Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and Ripple, in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum.“Now in Robinhood, for the first time, consumers will be able to invest in and trade stocks, ETFs, options and cryptocurrencies all in one place. You don’t need to have different apps, or be checking stocks on Robinhood and then logging into some exchange in Asia to trade your cryptocurrencies. It’s all consolidated,” says Baiju Bhatt, who serves as co-founder and co-CEO of Robinhood alongside Vlad Tenev.This consolidated portfolio thesis was a direct response to user feedback, Bhatt adds. Robinhood says its consumer base has now grown to more than three million users, contributing to a transaction volume of about $100 billion.“Robinhood has historically been very popular with younger consumers in our country, with our consumer being, on average, about 30 years old -- more than half of them being first-time investors in the stock market,” Bhatt says. “Now, we see this happening with cryptocurrency to another very large set of consumers, and we really love the opportunity to help start this journey as well -- to be their first touchpoint into cryptocurrencies.”When Robinhood Crypto initiates trading next month, it’ll bring to its launch the zero-commission trading structure that the broader Robinhood platform offers. From a fee perspective, Bhatt says today’s cryptocurrencies have become too expensive, and he hopes the firm’s pricing structure will systematically drive down associated costs for consumers in the industry.[Editor's note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]The firm says it’s looking to expand the launch to the remaining 45 U.S. states “soon,” and that it’s established a listing committee to help determine which new digital assets could make their way onto the platform in the future -- although consumer research made it clear for now that Bitcoin and Ethereum were in the highest demand. They’re currently the two largest cryptocurrencies with market capitalizations of $190 billion and $102 billion, respectively.“Cryptocurrencies have the potential to, I think, fundamentally reorganize the way that money works in the world from the ground up, to be a conduit to transition power from establishment financial institutions back directly to the hands of the people, and I think that’s something that is very appealing to us,” Bhatt says.Until recently, cryptocurrency trading in the United States has been done almost exclusively through crypto-specific exchanges, such as Coinbase, popular for its strong regulatory-minded structure; San Francisco-based Kraken and recently launched bitFlyer USA -- and while security for such exchanges has been an increasingly addressed concern, the global crypto-exchange market has been, and continues to be, marred by controversy stemming from glitches and multi-million-dollar hacks.The popularity and regulatory approval of crypto-exchange Coinbase has allowed newer stock-trading platforms to consolidate crypto and traditional asset trading via a Coinbase integration feature, but Robinhood is by far the largest traditional-leaning brokerage player to get in on the action. Robinhood Crypto is launching as a Robinhood Markets Inc. subsidiary, and as such will be regulated as a money services business.Meanwhile, of recent volatility, Bhatt says it’s to be expected in the short term and that the decision to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum is one for the long run.“It’s so tempting to try to add some predictability to how the prices of cryptos are going up or down. Internally we actually tried to take a long view,” Bhatt says. “And long term, we think [crypto] is going to be pretty successful, so whether it’s going up or down in the short term is not something we think too much about.”"

(Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg)","When bitcoin hit $1,000, In Mean realized he made a mistake. The developer mined “a lot of bitcoin” not long after the cryptocurrency was released in 2009, but he lost all the money he might have gained in a simple mistake: failing to backup the coins. Now that a growing number of Cambodians are buying into cryptocurrency, the Cambodian developer is building and marketing a local coin aimed at helping new users understand the field and bridge some of the technology knowledge gap that allows newcomers to fall into digital scams. KHCoin, his newest cryptocurrency, trades for a measly .000000999 btc on coinsmarkets.com, but it’s not meant to be a high-value currency yet, Mean said. At the moment, he’s giving KHCoin to any Cambodian who asks about it. “Every day, 10 or 20 people message me saying, 'I want to buy your coin, how much are you selling?'” Mean told me at a Phnom Penh franchise of U.S. cafe chain The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. “And I say ‘I’m not selling, go and get it for free!’”Mean started researching, compiling, and forking code for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in 2014, back when the value for bitcoin was $1,000, as he said. The developer -- who’s a brother and original business partner to executives of Cambodia’s well-known startups, online shopping platform Little Fashion and media site Khmerload -- served as the backend developer for Popular Coin and released his own cryptocurrency, Prosper Coin, which was originally promoted as a cryptocurrency that could be used in online casinos.More on Forbes: Bubble Or Not, Bitcoin's Price Surge Is A Boon To Southeast Asia's StartupsIn the past year, Mean turned his attention to learning more about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He hosts Q&A videos in Khmer on his public Facebook page, and behind the scenes, he’s working with a handful of local developers who he hopes can lead the pack in blockchain technology. And after gaining a pool of donations, in lieu of an initial coin offering, he released KHCoin and a digital wallet, available in the Google Play store.Picking up speedThroughout the country, hundreds of new users are trying to tap into the expanding global cryptocurrency market. Dozens of Facebook and Telegram groups have popped up among locals and expatriates, offering crypto news in Khmer and English, plus questions and trade offers from local enthusiasts. Steve Miller has been mining for bitcoin and learning about cryptocurrency throughout the eight years he’s lived in Phnom Penh, but it’s only last year where the practice started picking up speed among other expatriates and locals. “I’ve been trying to build a community here forever, but it’s been almost impossible because of the diversity of people that comes through here.”A man walks past a poster that informs customers that bitcoin can be used in this shop in Tokyo on...

(Photo credit: TORU YAMANAKA/AFP/Getty Images)Miller started his own company in Cambodia, Cryptoasia, as well as a bitcoin-taking restaurant called Coin Cafe out of his apartment in a Phnom Penh alley, in an effort to create a face-to-face community of digital currency traders and enthusiasts.  A handful of restaurants and guesthouses in the country are starting to accept bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, from a Phnom Penh poker clubhouse to a sub sandwich shop in sleepy riverside town Kampot. But few say they're getting any digital transactions. Pushback from the national bankMiller said he became invested in cryptocurrencies because of the underlying philosophy: limiting the number of federal and corporate intermediaries. But most of the people in Cambodia who ask Miller about cryptocurrency want to know how they can make money, hyped by the prevalent investment schemes in the country, he said. Though the National Bank of Cambodia is exploring blockchain technology, which allows secure digital currency transactions, the body is not willing to trust cryptocurrencies. Director General Chea Serey called the fintech “a new form of fraud” in a conference in November, and later banned initial coin offerings from Cambodia-based currencies.And late last month, the NBC said it “never allowed the purchase, sale and circulation of any form of cryptocurrencies” after Japanese firm Chaintope said it was developing K-coin with full support from the agency. The NBC would not respond to requests for comment. Miller said he understands the NBC’s concerns and hopes people who conduct fraud receive some kind of karmic punishment, but he believes the government’s interest in regulating cryptocurrency defeats the philosophical purpose of the technology.More on Forbes: South Korea's Crypto Crackdown: Exchanges Won't Go Down Without A Fight“A lot of people are losing their money [to cryptocurrencies] now, but that’s the best way to learn you need to do your due diligence,” he said. “The alternative is a lot of people go running to the government and that’s not what we want, we want people to be accountable for their actions.”In Mean, developer of the cryptocurrency KHCoin, explains that his development is meant to function...

He is already working with businesses, including his family’s online shopping chain Little Fashion, to set up an e-payment gateway. If the NBC changes heart, Mean could open up cryptocurrency payment gateways for several Cambodian websites “overnight.” “There is a trend right now, and when you talk about cryptocurrency you talk about the dream that happened when the internet started,” Mean said. “You cannot stop this. It’s a dream that people want, that money is truly money and not something that the government makes us believe anymore.”"

[+] 2018. Billionaire Warren Buffett said on CNBC that most digital coins won't hold their value. Photographer: Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg","2017 is viewed by many as the year of the crypto. However, with the increase in popularity and surge in value of cryptocurrencies, a significant number of cryptocurrency investors are now finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of trying to determine what, if any, is their tax liability attributable to their 2017 cryptocurrency transactions. The heightened level of taxpayer concern with correctly reporting the tax liability associated with their transactions can be directly associated to the John Doe summons the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued to Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States.The IRS is concerned that many U.S. taxpayers may not be accurately reporting the gains or income they have generated from their cryptocurrency transactions. Since the majority of cryptocurrency transactions have likely resulted in significant gains due to the surge in value in most cryptocurrencies, coupled with the fact that the gains are likely short-term capital gains (subject to ordinary income tax rates) since the cryptocurrencies were likely held less than 12 months, the IRS has good reason to be concerned.As a result, in a petition filed November 17, 2016 with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the court for a John Doe summons to be issued to Coinbase. The John Doe summons would require Coinbase to provide the DOJ with information related to all Bitcoin transactions it processed between 2013 and 2015. The DOJ would then share the information received with the IRS to be matched against filed tax returns. The IRS summons power is extremely broad and has been protected by the courts over the years. However, Coinbase actually had some success defending the John Doe summons issued by the IRS and was able to limit its demand to ask only for accounts that conducted Bitcoin transactions (either exchanging Bitcoin for dollars or sending or receiving coins from another Bitcoin user) worth $20,000 or more between 2013-2015.IRS Notice 2014-21 stated clearly that for federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. In addition, the Notice made it clear that virtual currency is not treated as a currency for tax purposes. The Notice then confirmed that cryptocurrency would be treated as a capital asset. IRS Notice 2014-21 holds that cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoins, will be considered property, which is a capital asset and subject to the capital gains tax rules so long as it’s not held for business purposes.As long as one holds cryptocurrencies for personal or investment purposes, any gain/loss from the sale of the cryptocurrency would be subject to the capital gains tax regime. If the cryptocurrency was held for less than twelve months (short-term capital gains), then ordinary income tax rates would apply. Whereas, if the cryptocurrency were held for twelve months or more, the favorable long-term capital gains rate would apply. The determination of a taxpayer’s overall net capital gain or loss is based on a netting formula involving all capital (cryptocurrency) transactions during the year, with the short-term gains netted against the short-term losses and the long-term gains netted against long-term capital losses. However, if one was considered in the business of trading cryptocurrencies or mining cryptocurrencies, they could be subject to the ordinary income tax rate.The tax law divides capital gains into two different classes determined by the calendar. Short-term gains come from the sale of property owned one year or less; long-term gains come from the sale of property held more than one year. Short-term gains are taxed at your maximum ordinary income tax rate, where the maximum tax rate was lowered to 37% under the Trump tax plan. Most long-term gains are taxed at either 0%, 15%, or 20% and can be subject to the additional 3.8% tax under Obamacare. For lower-bracket taxpayers, the long-term capital gains rate is 0%.There are exceptions, of course. The long-term capital gains rates were not impacted by the Trump tax plan. In order to determine whether your capital gains transaction will be subject to the short-term or long-term capital gains tax rules, one will need to determine their holding period. The holding period in connection with the capital asset transaction is the period of time that you owned the property before sale. When figuring the holding period, the day you bought property does not count, but the day you sold it does. So, if you bought a Bitcoin on April 20, 2017, your holding period began on April 21, 2017. Thus, April 20, 2018 would mark one year of ownership for tax purposes. If you sold on that day, you would have a short-term gain or loss. A sale one day later on April 21 would produce long-term tax consequences, since you would have held the asset for more than one year. The tax rate you pay depends on whether your gain is short-term or long-term.On the other hand, a capital loss is a loss on the sale of a capital asset, such as a stock, mutual fund, real estate, or cryptocurrency. As with capital gains, capital losses are divided by the calendar into short-term and long-term losses and can be deducted against capital gains, but there are limits. Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. So, short-term losses are first deducted against short-term gains, and long-term losses are deducted against long-term gains. Net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain. So, for example, if you have $2,000 of short-term loss from a cryptocurrency investment and only $1,000 of short-term gain from a cryptocurrency investment, the net $1,000 short-term loss can be deducted against your net long-term gain (assuming you have one).If a taxpayer makes a number of stock or cryptocurrency trades in a particular year, the end result could be a mix of long-term and short-term capital gains and losses. If you have an overall net capital loss for the year, you can deduct up to $3,000 of that loss against other kinds of income, including your salary and interest income, for example. Any excess net capital loss can be carried over to subsequent years to be deducted against capital gains and against up to $3,000 of other kinds of income. If you use married filing separate filing status, however, the annual net capital loss deduction limit is only $1,500.Since the IRS has treated cryptocurrencies as property for tax purposes and the SEC has indicated it should be treated as a security, it is believed that an individual taxpayer can generally determine whether they will be using the specific indication method, which lets one identify the specific cryptocurrency to be sold, or the first-in-first out (FIFO) method for determining the cost basis of the cryptocurrency. The FIFO is the default accounting method by the IRS, unless one has records to support another method. The specific identification option is the method likely to give one the most flexibility and potentially the best tax result. The net capital gain or loss is reported on the individual taxpayer’s federal income tax return (IRS Form 1040 – Schedule D).It is important to remember that each time you sell or exchange a cryptocurrency for either cash, another cryptocurrency, or for goods or services, the transaction would be considered a taxable event, which would be subject to either, short-term or long-term capital gain/losses based on the basis (what you paid for the crypto), holding period, and the price the cryptocurrency was sold or exchanged for. Moreover, if the transaction was part of a business, such as mining activity, the applicable corporate or ordinary income tax rates would apply. The good news is that new mobile applications and wallets are available that can help taxpayers keep track of the necessary tax reporting information needed to properly calculate and report their tax liability with respect to their cryptocurrency transactions during the year.In sum, as long as one purchases cryptocurrencies for personal or investment purposes, any gain/loss from the sale or exchange or the cryptocurrency would be subject to the capital gains tax regime. If the cryptocurrency was held less than twelve months, then ordinary income tax rates would apply and if the cryptocurrency were held for twelve months or more, the favorable long-term capital gains rate would apply. The total short-term and/or long-term tax due or loss recognized would be determined based off a netting formula. However, if one is considered in the business of trading cryptocurrencies or mining cryptocurrencies, the taxpayer could be subject to ordinary income tax rates.Investing in cryptocurrencies can be a risky and speculative investment option. Nevertheless, with the potential for financial success comes real and complex tax reporting obligations. It is important to consult with a tax adviser when navigating the cryptocurrency-related tax reporting rules."

So when I notice the chance to cover both in the same article, I jump all over it. Today via PCGamesN I learned about a sci-fi RPG called Imperatum that just launched an update with a unique hook: harnessing real-time Bitcoin prices to dynamically change the game's rewards and difficulty.","[Related News: This Steam Competitor Lets You Resell Digital Games, Mine Crypto For New Ones]ImperatumImperatum launched to Steam Early Access in 2017 and seems to scream ""Diablo in space,"" and that's perfectly OK with me. Its latest patch is the Crypto update which ushers in a new level, difficulty options, various gameplay tweaks, and something called ""Bitcoin Mode."" The game essentially monitors the real-time value of Bitcoin and scales its loot drops accordingly. The higher it climbs, the more frequently loot drops occur, and the higher the chance that rare loot can be snagged.With the sweeter loot comes a greater risk. A higher Bitcoin price means more difficult enemies. Of course, if the value plummets, so does the loot frequency and rarity of the items, as well as the strength of the enemies.Loot in Imperatum is more than cosmetic, and it's actually determined by the unique build of your character (no getting awesome equipment for classes you're not using). Knowing that, I really love the potential risk/reward that this kind of Bitcoin Mode introduces. I might have to download this and give it a spin just to see how the Bitcoin scaling is enabled from a UI point of view. Is there a ticker? How much does Bitcoin price have to increase or decrease to enable the changes in loot and difficulty? I'm fascinated by this.Fortunately this is an optional feature you can flip on, and not an integration that runs throughout the entire game. I have to applaud the developers, Pro Social Games, for building such a unique update into their game. We're seeing digital game platforms integrate crypto coins into their service, but is this the first time we've seen a developer integrate Bitcoin into a game in a way that dynamically changes how it's played? Either way, I think it's a really cool idea.Imperatum is available on Steam Early Access for $19.99."

U.S. ...","Jan 9, 2018,11:23am EST",Cryptocurrencies,"I consulted dozens of cryptocurrency (coin) traders on taxes in December and confirmed that coin traders made fortunes in 2017. Now that the 2017 tax-filing season is underway, these traders should gather online tax reports if available, use a coin trade accounting program, and review the latest guidance on tax treatment.Coinbase has a new online tax reportOn July 6, 2017, the IRS narrowed its summons against Coinbase, the most substantial U.S.-based coin exchange, to retrieve larger customers’ trades and other transactions to find unreported income. In late-December 2017, Coinbase added tax reporting of capital gains and losses using first in first out (FIFO). This move should undoubtedly please the IRS since there is no 1099-B issuance on coin trades.Capital gains and lossesIf you invested in cryptocurrencies and sold, exchanged, or spent it in 2017, you have to report a capital gain or loss on each transaction, including coin-to-currency sales, coin-to-coin trades, and purchases of goods or services using a coin. Deduct coin fees and other expenses appropriately.Some coin deals naturally generate taxable income, including coin-to-currency trades and mining income. For example, Bitcoin sold for U.S. dollars is a noticeable capital gain or loss reportable on Form 8949. Or, when a coin miner receives a coin for his work, he or she naturally recognizes business revenue based on the value of the coin.Imputed incomeThe big problem for the IRS is that most other coin transactions are not evident for tax reporting, including coin-to-coin trades, hard forks (chain splits), and using a coin to purchase goods and services. The coin investor should “impute” a sales or exchange transaction to report a capital gain or loss on coin-to-coin trades and using a coin to purchase items. Many coin investors and their accountants overlook or mishandle this reporting and underpay the IRS.The IRS labels coin “intangible property.” Coin users may call it “digital money,” but it’s not sovereign government-issued money. That’s the critical difference: Each use of money is not a taxable event. Imagine having to report a capital gain or loss every time you purchased an item or asset with cash or a credit card. That would be ridiculous.Coin-to-currency tradesMost taxpayers comprehend that if they purchased Bitcoin in 2016 for $10,000 and sold in 2017 for $30,000, they should report a capital gain of $20,000 on their 2017 tax return form 8949. A coin position held for one year or less is considered a short-term capital gain, taxed at ordinary tax rates (up to 39.6% for 2017 and 37% for 2018). A coin position held for more than one year is considered a long-term capital gain, taxed at capital gains rates (up to 20% for 2017 and 2018).Capital losses offset capital gains in full, and a net capital loss is limited to $3,000 against other types of income on an individual tax return. An excess capital loss is carried forward to the subsequent tax year(s), and it may not be carried back to a prior year. Some coin traders will pay massive taxes on capital gains in 2017 and get stuck with a capital loss limitation and carryover in 2018.Coin-to-coin tradesMany coin traders actively make coin-to-coin trades like Bitcoin to Ethereum and then Ethereum to Litecoin. Currently, coin investors purchase alt coins using Bitcoin or Ethereum.Many taxpayers and preparers delay capital gains income on coin-to-coin trades by inappropriately classifying them as Section 1031 “like-kind exchanges,” where they may defer income to the replacement position’s cost basis. While the IRS hasn’t provided guidance on this matter,  I do not believe the majority of coin-to-coin trades made on coin exchanges qualify for Section 1031 transactions as they fail one or both of the two primary requirements (and both are required). First, Bitcoin may not be a like-kind property with Ethereum. Second, coin-to-coin trades executed on coin exchanges do not constitute a direct two-party exchange, and coin exchanges are likely not qualified intermediaries in a multi-party exchange.Coin-to-coin trading reminds me of forex trading between different currency pairs. Various currencies are not like-kind property (i.e., U.S. dollars are not a like-kind property with euros). Each coin has its version of a blockchain, and the network of users has a different purpose for each coin.I asked coin tax expert Jim Calvin, Partner of Deloitte and author of When (and If) Income is Realized from Bitcoin Chain-Splits, if he thought these trades could qualify for Section 1031 like-kind exchange treatment in 2017 and prior years.“It is neither a simple nor single factual issue,” he said. “It is not just whether the swapped coins are like-kind property, but also whether all the other requirements of Section 1031 can be met including the use of intermediaries.”Atomic swaps or atomic cross-chain trading started in August 2017. The new technology allows a direct two-party exchange, bypassing coin exchanges. That may meet one requirement, but the coins must also be a like-kind property for Section 1031 deferral.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and coin tradersStarting in 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act limits Section 1031 like-kind exchanges to real property, not for sale. Investors may not use it on artwork, collectibles, and other tangible and intangible property, including cryptocurrencies.The Act introduced Section 199A, a 20% deduction on qualified business income (QBI) in pass-through entities, subject to thresholds, limitations, and haircuts. A trader tax status (TTS) coin trader likely does not qualify for the deduction because he or she has capital gains income, excluded from QBI. This is different from a TTS securities trader who can elect Section 475 MTM ordinary income, which is included in QBI.Coin hard forks (chain-splits)The IRS has not provided guidance on hard fork transactions, and tax experts and coin traders debate its tax treatment. Bitcoin had a hard fork in its blockchain on Aug. 1, 2017, dividing into two separate coins: Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Each holder of a Bitcoin unit was entitled to arrange receipt of a unit of Bitcoin Cash. Some Bitcoin holders did not gain immediate access to be able to sell Bitcoin Cash, so they may feel it’s okay to defer income on the fork transaction until they obtain such access, or later sell it. Coinbase did not support Bitcoin Cash when it forked, but it did add it to accounts for rightful holders in late-2017.It’s reasonable that coin traders should not have to report taxable income on a hard fork until the new coin is time-stamped as a ledger entry, sending the coins to new outputs in the blockchain. Facts and circumstances on hard forks vary widely. An “old fork” could die out if miners collectively switch over to the new blockchain and abandon the old coin. Bitcoin Cash successfully forked from Bitcoin; both trade at higher values today than on the fork date. Hard forks frequently happen, and their initial fair market value varies significantly across coin exchanges.“Taxable income is realized if the owner of pre-split bitcoin exercises dominion and control over the corresponding chain-split coins, and the income realized will be equal to the value of the chain-split coins at that time,” Calvin said. “Most owners holding Bitcoin on exchanges were unable to control if and when chain-split coins were claimed, the time income was realized, and may still be unaware of the date or value to use.” I think many Bitcoin Cash holders had dominion and control over the new coin sometime in 2017, and they should recognize ordinary income on receiving it.Coin trade accounting programsCoin tax reporting is complex and voluminous. Consider two coin accounting solutions: Bitcoin.Tax and CoinTracking.Info.I suggest using the FIFO accounting method for cost-basis on coin capital gain and loss transactions. The IRS has not yet stated if it will permit other accounting methods for coin, like the specific identification allowed for securities. Even if the IRS approves specific identification for coin, compliance with the requirement for contemporaneously written instructions to the coin exchange doesn’t seem possible. I doubt a coin exchange would confirm and execute a specific identification.Because the IRS labels coin intangible property, wash-sale loss rules likely don’t apply. TTS traders using Section 475 ordinary gain or loss on securities and/or commodities (Section 1256 contracts) may not use Section 475 on a coin since it’s not a security or a commodity in the eyes of the IRS.How to deduct coin-trading costsCoin traders pay various transaction costs, fees, and interest expenses in coin and currency. Be sure to convert coin expenses to U.S. dollars at the time spent. It’s critical to distinguish between tax categories — transaction costs, investment expenses, investment interest expenses, and trading business expenses — as they are all handled differently on tax returns.Transaction fees can be deducted from sales proceeds and then added to cost basis for purchases, so reflect them on net capital gains and losses. These charges include trading costs (approximately 0.25%) paid to a coin exchange and fees paid to miners when transferring coin between addresses to get transactions into the next block.The new tax law suspends investment expenses for 2018, but you can still deduct them as a miscellaneous itemized deduction for 2017 (if they are more than 2% of AGI). These costs include bank wire transfer fees for transferring currency to a coin exchange; loan or borrow fees paid to a coin exchange; and withdrawal fees paid to a coin exchange for removing money or coin. (It’s essential to separate loan fees vs. margin interest, as they have different tax treatment.)Investment interest expense can be an itemized deduction, limited to investment income, with the excess carried over to the subsequent tax year. This includes interest on borrowed funds paid in coin to lender/exchange. The new tax law did not change the rules for investment interest expenses.Trading business expenses are deducted from gross income. If the coin trader qualifies for TTS, investment expenses and investment interest expenses are deducted as business expenses on Schedule C or through an entity.Miners deduct business expenses against revenues.Example: Purchasing goods and services with coinOn Jan. 1, 2017, Joe bought 100 Bitcoins at a price of $998 each, for a total cost basis of $99,800. On June 1, 2017, when the price of a Bitcoin unit was $2,452, Joe used a Bitcoin to purchase a computer for $2,452. Without realizing it, Joe triggered a reportable short-term capital gain on his 2017 Form 8949. The sales proceeds are $2,452, representing the fair market value of the Bitcoin he used to purchase the computer. His cost basis for that one Bitcoin unit used is $998, so his net short-term capital gain is $1,454. If Joe uses the computer in his business, he will deduct $2,452 as an expense.Bottom lineI suggest coin traders calculate capital gains and losses on coin transactions, including coin-to-coin trades made on exchanges, and use the FIFO accounting method. File an extension by the due date of your tax return (April 17, 2018, for individuals), and pay taxes owed for 2017 with the extension. During the additional time (file by Oct. 15, 2018), perhaps the IRS will answer our questions, including which if any coin-to-coin trades may use Section 1031 deferral in 2017. If the IRS allows it, maybe coin traders can still file that way on an original tax return filing. Consult a coin tax expert.Postscript: The IRS calls for the “specific identification” (SI) accounting method for use on sales of property, including intangible property (coin). IRS regulations for SI require “adequate identification” of lots sold on a contemporaneous basis, and I don’t think most coin traders comply with these rules. In June 2016, the AICPA asked the IRS if coin traders could use “first in first out” (FIFO) as an alternative solution, which the IRS permits for securities. Unless you comply with SI rules, I suggest using the FIFO accounting method for coin.

You have to look 
at how many coins WILL exist. There is a set amount of Bitcoins that 
will ...","Jan 22, 2018,02:38pm EST","Erik Finman is a 19-year-old entrepreneur who began making Bitcoin investments at the age 12 after a gift from his grandmother. By 2013, Erik cashed in the first of his Bitcoin investments, when they were valued at $1,200 a piece.","With this crypto cash, Finman launched his first startup, Botangle, an online education program that allowed frustrated students to discover specific teachers digitally (via video chat). The company was then acquired for its back-end technology until Erik took back control of the company in 2017. Finman is currently working on several large projects including a mission financed by NASA to ‘democratize space’ with a time capsule/satellite. He is also focused on education projects in Dubai, robotics products and future cryptocurrency announcements. He talks exclusively with Forbes about bringing some sense to the current crypto mania and his ongoing belief in the currency and especially the blockchain.Monty Munford: Why did you invest in Bitcoin to begin with?Erik Finman: Me and a family member (sic) were very political. And we saw this as an incredible way to transcend the financial system including Wall Street. We discovered the incredible implications politically that this technology hasn't even begun to crack... yet!As a crypto-native, how different is your experience than more seasoned individuals such as digital natives?I think a lot of digital natives who got into this cryptocurrency space feel like that they know a lot. And can transfer a lot of their skills into this new world. And although that's true, I think there's more to it than that.To create good cryptocurrency technologies, you almost have to get behind a certain philosophy. Which is how Bitcoin got started in the first place. One of decentralization and increasing freedom.But I think we must be careful with what projects we back and who we support.Can you explain the real difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum?Ethereum is a technology that enables developers to easily build technologies on top of that. If I were to create a new kind of website or app built on blockchain tech, I would likely use Ethereum. Bitcoin is a lot harder to develop applications with.What are your predictions for both?Bitcoin will continue to go up for a long time with lots of ups and downs along the way.Ethereum, however, will be used widely as a technology. But I think Bitcoin will beat Ethereum in currency value. You have to look at how many coins WILL exist. There is a set amount of Bitcoins that will exist and not all of them have been released.There can only be 21 million Bitcoins that can exist and with Ether, it's looking like there will be 90 million to 100 million coins. There is a set amount of coins to create artificial scarcity. So if you have way more supply with even the same amount of demand between the two, Bitcoin will be worth more.What will ICOs be like in 2018, have they reached a peak?I think 2017 marks the end of the majority of the 'scam' ICOs. Although some good ICOs came out of that year, there was a lot of junk.In 2018 and 2019 you're going to see the REAL world-changing ICO 2.0 coins.Firman has strong ideas on the future of digital currencies.Telegram, Line and other messaging apps are going down the crypto route, what's your take on that?I think it's amazing. The users can now own part of the economy of their app. On the business side of things. You can now create something for free that would otherwise have no business model before.It's unbelievable!Messaging app Kik recently moved its ICO base from Ether to Stellar. Is this likely to happen with others?Ether is like the dial-up internet of cryptocurrency technologies. That may change. But right now, Stellar has more advanced technologies and the founders of Stellar have induced more confidence in their technology.Right now with Ethereum, Vitalik hasn't instilled confidence in the longevity of his project and whether he is trustworthy to decide the vision of Ethereum.Will RegTech be adaptable enough to cope with the speed of crypto adoption, both from individual investors and companies adopting the blockchain?Regulations will always fall behind advancing technologies. But they'll be there and if not stopped, ever increasing.But it's going to be even harder to catch up with than the internet and have an even more direct impact on politicians. Because the main point of Blockchain technologies is decentralizing what normally would've been impossible to before.And since most of the initial first users of Bitcoin (and thus the richest) are libertarians. There's now a multi-billion dollar war chest to take on and decentralize the jobs of politicians.It'll be interesting to see how Governments handle that.Which crypto and blockchain technologies do you see emerging in 2018?Bitcoin is obviously a big one... and I don't think it's too late to get in. Remember you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. In the crypto space, I also like Ethereum and Zcash.You haven't seen the real world effect of Bitcoin and blockchain technology even a little bit yet. Blockchain tech is where the internet was in the 1980s. Not the 1990s, but the 1980s.Blockchain tech is the new frontier and what we'll be able to build is almost incomprehensible. The invention of this technology will be looked at in history as one of the great wonders of the world. A true gift to humanity that almost seems like it's from the future."

Its mascot is a Japanese shiba inu dog.Dogecoin, like Ripple and Ethereum, is considered an altcoin. An altcoin is an open source, peer-to-peer digital token that is an alternative to bitcoin.Like other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin can be mined or purchased on exchanges.Unlike bitcoin, the supply of Dogecoin is plentiful with over 100 billion coins outstanding.What has driven Dogecoin's explosive growth?Investors who missed out on bitcoin's rapid rise are looking for cryptocurrency alternatives.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, is driving investors to seek other cryptocrrencies that haven't experienced the same explosive growth that Bitcoin and Ethereum have.Think of it as a relative value play in that investors who missed out on bitcoin are looking for crypto assets that they perceive as ""cheaper"" compared to Bitcoin.Many of the altcoin cryptocurrencies seek to build on the success of bitcoin and operate in similar ways.However, some cryptocurrencies seek to offer improvements related to privacy, proof-of-stake and transaction speed, among other features.In terms of relative size, Bitcoin's market capitalization is more than 100 times larger than Dogecoin's.(Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment. Disclosure: I don’t own any cryptocoins or tokens)."

[+] CryptoSpace conference in Moscow, Russia, on Friday, Dec. 8, 2017. Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg","Crypto-mania has spread so quickly that the mere mention of an association with Bitcoin, blockchain, or cryptocurrency is enough to send investors into a buying frenzy. Take, for instance, 
 
Eastman Kodak
 which has been thrown a financial lifeboat this week — once left for dead, it saw its stock price jump 135% on Tuesday after announcing it was creating its own cryptocurrency, KodakCoin.

Seagate Technology
 shares rose more than 15% on Monday as a post on Seeking Alpha speculated that the hard drive manufacturing company may own billions of dollars worth of the XRP cryptocurrency (commonly known as Ripple). Seagate capitalized on this attention by preannouncing financial results for the quarter, reporting stronger than expected revenue and providing strong guidance, sending the shares higher still.XRP is the third biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Seagate invested in Ripple Labs back in 2015, and since Ripple Labs currently owns approximately 60% of the XRP in the world, the Seeking Alpha poster surmised that Seagate's stake in cryptocurrency is not being properly valued by the Street.Despite my own previous reservations, I bought a small amount of cryptocurrency (less than $500 worth) when it dipped right before Christmas, and will be updating readers on how these investments play out. Now, the possibility of receiving  a substantial 5.4% dividend from a stable, high-profile company involved in cryptocurrency seems awfully tantalizing.Before jumping right in and buying shares of Seagate, though, it's important to research their financials, their management, and their competitive advantages, or moat, within their industry (Note: All data is from Morningstar and is current as of January 10, 2018).Seagate manufactures hard drives and data storage devices, including mobile and enterprise cloud storage solutions. It's an industry driven by two main players: Seagate and the market leader, 
 
Western Digital
. A possible explanation for Seagate's financial difficulties over the last few years has been the shift in preference from hard disk drives (HDD) to solid state drives (SSD). Seagate's specialty is in HDDs, while Western Digital has led the way in SSDs.On the valuation side, Seagate appears undervalued, with a P/E ratio of 17.8 compared to the industry average of 24.1 and the S&P 500's multiple of 22.9. Seagate's forward P/E of 11.6 is substantially lower than the S&P's, which is 19.8.It looks like Seagate had a rough year in 2016 as its numbers in most major categories were down big across the board (EPS went from 5.26 to 0.82). 2017 saw a nice recovery (EPS = 2.58) and their financials seem to be trending upward.Seagate's whopping 5.4% dividend is one of the highest out there, and they have a history of raising it while also buying back shares, even in 2016. I'm very concerned, however, with their ability to sustain the dividend, as their payout ratio in 2016 was a ludicrous 225%, meaning they had to borrow a lot of money to make all those dividend payouts to their shareholders. The payout ratio dropped to 103.7% last year and stands at 95.1% TTM, which is still a dangerously high level.Speaking of borrowed money, another major area of concern is their leverage, as their debt-to-equity ratio has been climbing rapidly over the last few years (1.38 in 2015, 2.59 in 2016, 3.68 in 2017 and 4.03 in their latest quarter). This is not sustainable over the long term.It can be very dangerous to chase yield, and an investor must always consider the worst-case scenarios. That 5.4% dividend may be cut or even eliminated if earnings don't increase significantly and free cash flow improves. As the Seeking Alpha post is mere speculation, there's no way of knowing how Seagate's Ripple investment will contribute to the company's bottom line.As for management, sometimes a change in leadership is required to push the company in a different direction. Seagate recently named Dave Mosley as its new CEO in October 2017. Mosley has been with the company for over 20 years and was most recently the COO.The staggering amount of data requiring storage keeps multiplying daily, and Seagate seems well positioned for the future of data storage. While there are certainly some red flags, Seagate could be a more traditional value play for conservative investors looking to get in on crypto.Many investors have shied away from buying cryptocurrency due to its extreme volatility and their own lack of understanding of its value and usage. Seagate offers fundamental investors an opportunity to grab a small piece of the crypto pie by owning a profitable company that makes real products, all while being paid a dividend and minimizing exposure to severe volatility.Seagate's cryptocurrency positioning is certainly less desperate than Kodak's, as Seagate's fundamentals are vastly superior. They're also not rushing in on the crypto-craze — they've been investing in it for years. As always, there are risks involved and investors must do their own due diligence before investing, but the potential long-term risks seem much lower than buying cryptocurrencies outright.Disclosure: The author owns XRP, Ethereum and Bitcoin. Neither the author nor American Dream Investing own stock in Seagate Technology at the time of this writing."

(Shutterstock),"What's a blockchain? And why do I need to put money in there?Trying to figure out what the blockchain is or how it works is like the olden days of the internet when college students were asking: what's a modem? What's this Mosaic thing? And why do I need it to do my homework?Trying to explain the future possibilities of the internet in the early 90s is like explaining the future possibilities of blockchain today. A recent IBM commercial about how food safety is improved when food can be tracked on the blockchain does little to educate anyone on what that technology is, or does, or why something similar doesn't exist already. But it does show blue-chip companies developing blockchain for future business.In other words, blockchain, and all that it will become is not just for venture capitalists hunting for the next big start-up. This is not a fad.The learning curve for investors is steep.Does a blockchain platform need cryptocurrency? No. Is blockchain something that's on the internet? Yes (what isn't?). Is it like one big QuickBooks? Maybe.""Twenty years ago you couldn’t really define the internet either. Now you think you can because you can't live your daily life without it,"" says Matt Markiewicz, managing director of Innovation Shares in New York. ""That's going to be the same with blockchain technology. But trying to boil it down in layman’s terms and explain what sectors will benefit is really tough. We are all still figuring this out.""As an investment story, some of the most well-known companies in the world are hopping on the blockchain bandwagon and trying to monetize it. Investors who want to make money on blockchain, need to invest in the companies that are both earning revenues from it today and building the systems that might make for a new revenue stream in the future. It's a combination of long-term bets and very short-term ones, too.Markiewicz, an iShares alumn from their capital markets team, left BlackRock in May 2015 and helped create Innovation Shares last summer.  This week, Innovation Shares launched what would become one of three new blockchain funds brought to the market in a roughly 10-day stretch.""Blockchain buzz in the financial press helps feed the appetite to invest in companies with exposure to it,"" Markiewicz says. ""We are trying build the best solution to invest in blockchain.""From a pure sentiment standpoint, everyone wants a piece of this blockchain thing. It goes without saying that the ETF world would follow the trend. The biggest disruptor to the managed investment industry is going after what is arguably the biggest disruptor in technology since the 1990s.The Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol (KOIN) fund was seeded with $2.5 million and launched on Tuesday. The fund is up half a percent, hardly what most investors have come to expect from anything associated with the word ""blockchain.""  Blockchain is so closely considered bitcoin's cousin, that anything less than a 50% week is a disappointment.In October, the addition of the word ""blockchain"" to the name of U.K. tech firm On-Line PLC translated into a 394% gain in one day. Kodak saw a 200+% jump from Jan. 9 to 10 after announcing its foray into blockchain and crypto.Kodak has gone from an old company stock, flatlined by investor boredom and a dying filmed... [+] photography business, to a new digital company embracing blockchain and cryptocurrencies.Amplify ETFs and Reality Shares went from the same $2.5 million in seed funding to $40 million almost overnight. Both have over $120 million in assets under management in less than two trading weeks.Such is the power, and the hype, of blockchain.The new ETFs make it easier for retail investors to benefit from this new technology, without having to go the venture capital route or invest in highly risky initial coin offerings of companies that are not necessarily pure play blockchain firms.No, bitcoin is not the blockchain, but it needs the blockchain to survive.

(Shutterstock)IBM, the Chinese and ""Kodak Coin""Earlier this month, Kodak announced the Kodak coin — a blockchain-based service and accompanying cryptocurrency allowing for photographers to store their photos and license their photos directly off their blockchain. They would be able to track the use of the images and track payment on those images.Digital photo warehouses already exist online, and photographers are paid accordingly through a middleman. But this Kodak service was something new. And it came with a token, a crypto coin that would allow for discounts for using its service. The stock price doubled on the news.""Examples of companies getting involved in blockchain are propping up all the time,"" says Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify ETFs. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing (BLOK) fund launched Jan. 17.IBM is working on a food safety blockchain pilot program with Walmart, Chinese e-commerce company JD.com and the Tsinghua University in China. Recent testing by Walmart showed that the IBM blockchain reduced the time it took to trace a package of rotten mangoes from the source farm to the store in two seconds. It normally takes a week.""Some other companies will roll it out in China. IBM hopes to show there is value in this,"" Magoon says. BLOK owns IBM. ""They hope to do it as a private blockchain that IBMers administer. Think of it as a business like cloud computing company Salesforce, where you get a tool similar to their customer relationship management (CRM) program and IBM can say, 'Hey, subscribe to our blockchain for better food safety,'"" he says. ""There will be money in that.""Kodak signage at the CES 2018 in Las Vegas on January 10. Kodak shares rose 245% in one day...

""It remains to be seen if Kodak can succeed with their Kodak coin, but we are in!"" says Christian Magoon, CEO of Amplify Investments.

They still do, but now they're a blockchain company and are building a cryptocurrency exchange. The stock is up 316% in the last 12 months as a result of the strategy shift.""Overstock is probably getting 80% of its revenue and earnings from blockchain today,"" says Eric Ervin, co-founder and CEO of Reality Shares and a Forbes contributor. ""The old Overstsock company has nothing to do with the gains they’ve made lately. It's all about the blockchain.""Who would have known that Overstock was a blockchain play? NVIDIA Corporation is as well. They make the semiconductors that help power the Bitcoin miners. For those who are not in-the-know, a Bitcoin miner looks a lot like those old tower CPUs from your home PC. They are simply computers that are used to process Bitcoin transactions.These three ETFs promise to find companies with bonafide ties to the blockchain. They have different approaches, but they are all hooked on the theme.Innovation Shares is a quant model based on a natural language processing algorithm that picks the stocks. Reality Shares is passive. Amplify is actively managed.""When we looked at how much these stocks moved, we didn’t feel like we could buy and hold for six months,"" says Magoon. ""Active management might be a riskier move, but we are going for it. The portfolio changes daily. There have been three or four changes already. If something goes south, we aren't waiting to rebalance an index, we're getting out quick.""This is Overstock before blockchain (flatlined) and after blockchain (Mt. Everest).Similar Holdings, Different ApproachEach of the three ETFs holds Intel. KOIN and BLOK both own Taiwan Semiconductors and NVIDIA because they are a play off cryptocurrency mining. The Reality Shares Nasdaq NextGen Economy (BLCN) ETF has more top 10 holdings in common with Amplify, owning HIVE Blockchain Technologies, Japanese investment bank SBI, IBM and Overstock.KOIN has around 11% in Asia. Reality Shares doubles down at 29%, mainly because of Japan.Neither funds call themselves stock pickers, per se, though Reality Shares would be the stand-out.Investors looking to choose one ETF over the other are making a call on the approach, not the companies in the fund.""I love that Innovation Shares is doing machine learning and AI to find their holdings,"" says Magoon. ""Maybe they have a Ferrari there. I don’t know. We are of the mind that you have to take advantage of the momentum and scale up on the position fast. Flexibility is key. We have 45% of our portfolio in the top 10 names. But we can do that because we have a manager watching those names and can get out if we need to. We are not just buying sector leaders on the S&P,"" he says. ""We are trying to buy some blockchain horse power.""Innovation Shares is tracking companies and putting them in a proprietary index called the Blockchain Innovators Index. Most companies are from the U.S. China is No. 2, with an 11% weighting. For them, these ETFs are thematic ETFs. It's not easy to create a product based on themes because Wall Street analysts divide companies by sector. IBM is not a blockchain company. It's an IT company.""We use machine learning to pluck keywords out of a search tool to find companies with ties to blockchain and use sentiment based analysis to look at companies, see if they can be considered part of the theme. I think the market misses some,"" Markiewicz says.For instance, their fund holds Visa and Mastercard in the top 10. Mastercard began blockchain payments last October.Coinbase was ranked No. 2 on U.K.-based company Richtopia's Top 100 Most Influential Blockchain... [+] Organizations list in 2016. (Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg)Companies that are picked by the algorithm are categorized as cryptocurrency payment operators, bitcoin mining companies, solution providers and early adopters. They are then screened for a sentiment score to see how strong the relationship is to the theme.""Those are the guys who make the team,"" Markiweicz says. The index has 42 stocks.  The fund holds 34 stocks as of Jan. 30.Reality Shares is also big on China.""China is huge in blockchain right now,"" he says. Reality Shares is looking to build an index of A-Shares and H-Shares working on blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. ""I think you can find about 30 Chinese companies that would make the index,"" Ervin says. ""China is where all the cryptocurrency mining is happening. A lot of the underlying technology that goes into that is being made in China,"" he says.Two years ago, the PureFunds CyberSecurity ETF (HACK) hit $1 billion in assets under management seven months after its launch. It was the first time a newcomer brought in that much capital from investors so quickly. It took 32 days to bring in $100 million.In less than two weeks, two blockchain ETFs brought in over $100 million each. It's impressive. If the trend is their friend, these three ETFs will hit a billion dollars this year. Maybe one of them will be the lucky owner of a $1 billion blockchain fund.""Coinbase will do a billion dollars in revenue this year,"" says Ervin about the blockchain companied famous for powering one of the best-known cryptocurrency exchanges. ""They have more customers than Schwab...and there is zero chance that they have more employees than Schwab,"" he says, hinting to the type of change blockchain will bring to the financial sector in the years ahead."

If the rapid growth of Bitcoin and Ethereum has shown us anything, it’s that cryptocurrencies will take a massive part of online payments in the near future.Popular online retailers, including eBay and Amazon, are now preparing to accept cryptocurrencies as a payment method. The Swiss government is already accepting Bitcoin for tax payments. And, according to research, as many as 5.8 million people already use cryptocurrency wallets.Whether you’re looking to add Bitcoin as a payment method on your e-commerce website or show Ethereum trading prices on your news website in real time, here are some of the cryptocurrency WordPress plugins that we've been eyeing.How To Accept Bitcoin PaymentsIf you’re planning on accepting cryptocurrency payments on your website, before installing any cryptocurrency payment plugins, you’ll need to sign up for a service that allows you to accept, store and manage your cryptocurrency payments (i.e., a cryptocurrency wallet).BitPay is one of the most popular and reliable services that helps businesses set up Bitcoin payments on websites. Setting up BitPay on a WordPress website is easy. It supports all common e-commerce plugins, including WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads.The only downside to using BitPay is that it only allows you to accept Bitcoin payments. If you want a service that supports other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin, you can use a service like CoinPayments.1. CryptoWooCryptoWoo is a well-crafted premium plugin that supports fully automated payment processing with cryptocurrencies. You can use the plugin with WooCommerce to accept bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin and more as a payment option.A key feature of CryptoWoo is that it can process payments on your website without redirecting the customers to another website.

You can directly integrate the plugin on your website and start accepting Bitcoin payments right away.  3. GiveIf you’re a nonprofit website or simply looking to add a button on your site to accept donations from credit cards as well as bitcoin, then Give is the best WordPress plugin you can use. Give is one of the most popular donation plugins available on WordPress that allows you to accept both one-time and recurring donations.Give has a Stripe add-on that supports both credit card and Bitcoin payment processing. With this add-on, you can easily accept donations with Bitcoin.While the Give plugin itself is free to use, the Stripe add-on will cost $62 for a single site license, and Stripe will also charge a fee of 2.9%, plus $0.30 from every transaction. 4. Mollie PaymentsYou shouldn’t have to install multiple WordPress plugins to process different types of payment options. Mollie is an all-in-one plugin that allows you to accept PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and Bitcoin payments on your website.The Mollie Payments plugin integrates with WooCommerce for selling both digital and physical products on your website. The plugin is also free to use and doesn’t charge any monthly or gateway fees for processing payments.5. Coin TableBitcoin and Ethereum trading is one of the hottest topics these days.

The IRS is using tracking software, and the IRS successfully went after Coinbase accounts via summons. And more IRS enforcement is surely on the way. Yet there has long been speculation that a special IRS amnesty program will be announced for Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Even government officials have mentioned the idea, but so far, it hasn't arrived. Without a formal amnesty, you can still amend a few returns to pick up additional income you failed to report. But some people are reluctant. A more predictable tax and penalty result is what IRS amnesty programs usually provide.","(AP Photo/Kin Cheung)If the IRS finds you first though an audit, you won't be protected. But some people are not comfortable just preparing and filing a few amended tax returns to correct mistakes. For more serious transgressions, traditionally, if you voluntarily go to the IRS to correct your tax problems before the IRS discovers them, you won't be prosecuted. Still, one can feel pretty vulnerable with a powerful agency like the IRS.Although there is not a special IRS amnesty for crypto, there is one for offshore accounts. If you have an offshore account, the IRS amnesty can offer crypto investors a back door. With extensive data swapping deals between the IRS, foreign governments, and foreign banks, almost no offshore account is secret any more. Yet, offshore account holders can safely fix their problems, even if they intentionally evaded reporting in the past. The cost of the IRS amnesty can be small compared to the risk of vastly larger civil penalties or prosecution. Civil FBAR penalties alone can wipe out foreign accounts.There are two IRS programs, the OVDP or Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, and the Streamlined program. The OVDP is a clean wash-your-hands kind of way to correct past tax filings and come clean. It involves filing up to 8 years of tax returns (or amended tax returns) and FBARs. You pay taxes, interest and a 20% penalty on whatever you owe. For most people, there’s also a 27.5% penalty on your highest offshore account balance. In some cases, that penalty can be 50%, depending on the bank and timing. In contrast, the Streamlined program involves only 3 years of tax returns, not 8. You file 6 FBARs in Streamlined instead of 3, to match the longer FBAR statute of limitations.The Foreign Streamlined program (for U.S. persons abroad) has no penalty. The Domestic Streamlined program involves a 5% penalty pegged to the highest offshore account balance over the 6 FBAR years. Still, Streamlined filings are subject to worrisome IRS audits. Thus, for crypto investors with risk, the OVDP seems a far better hook for resolving crypto tax problems. As long as you are filing amended tax returns, other corrections unrelated to your foreign accounts can be handled too. After all, before you sign amended tax returns under penalties of perjury, you need to make sure they are accurate. If you failed to report any other income, you should include it on your amended returns.By its terms, the OVDP applies to foreign account matters. Other corrections are technically not part of the OVDP, so the IRS could pursue these items outside the OVDP. In reality, though, the IRS appears to be processing them all together. In short, if you have other unrelated corrections to your returns, by all means make them. In fact, cleaning up domestic tax problems is a feature of many OVDP cases. Until the IRS has a special crypto amnesty, the OVDP may be worth a look."

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images)","In the online criminal underworld, a booming industry has been born, with as much as $100 million to be made per hacker. It involves breaking into people's PCs and smartphones, installing malware on the devices and then forcing them to mine Monero, a cryptocurrency that's become increasingly attractive to ne'er-do-wells of late due to its focus on protecting the identities of its owners.On Tuesday, Cisco's Talos division detailed the extent of the problem. Such is the rise in popularity of cryptomining amongst criminals that it could overtake ransomware as their favorite way of making illicit profit, according to Talos. Why? It's partly because with newer coins like Monero, which is currently worth around $275 per token (known as an XMR), the power needed to mine a vast number of coins at speed is small when compared to the likes of Bitcoin.Such mining relies on computing power to solve difficult mathematical problems; once they're solved coins are unlocked. The more power hackers can steal from the PCs they compromise, the quicker they can mine coins.According to Talos data, a typical PC can generate around $0.28 of Monero per day. Where a hacker has control of tens of thousands or even millions of PCs, the profit can be significant, up to $100 million for a single hacker crew, Cisco's security division claimed.The data backs this up. As the report notes, just a 2,000-strong botnet can generate $568 in Monero per day or $204,400 per year. And in one real-world campaign, a hacker made $184,000, whilst another was observed with enough computing power to potentially hit $262,500 per year.Moving on from ransomware?Whilst mining is easy, hacking people's PCs and smartphones (typically done via spam and phishing campaigns) doesn't require any additional action on behalf of the victim, like paying a ransom, beyond opening and installing the malware that silently carries out the mining. So cryptomining makes for a quieter, simpler, more efficient crime than ransomware.The trend away from ransomware to malicious cryptocurrency mining is something Ryan Olson, intelligence director at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, has seen in recent months too. ""What we're looking at from a near and potentially long-term perspective is the value of a computer that has just a regular old CPU might be more just leaving it quietly running some cryptocurrency miner rather than infecting it with ransomware or some other software that might steal data,"" Olson told Forbes.Palo Alto recently detailed an attack that infected between an estimated 15 million and 30 million PCs across southeast Asia, northern Africa and South America. Again, the hackers wanted to use the power from those compromised systems to carry out Monero mining.Same old tacticsThough illegal cryptocurrency mining is a burgeoning market, much remains the same in the way the criminals are operating. The Talos report noted the origins of this criminal craze were on Chinese and Russian hacking forums. Indeed, the first siting of underground individuals discussing the use of mining botnets was back in November 2016, on a Chinese site.And they're sticking to tried and tested techniques to infect PCs. Amongst the various campaigns Cisco has seen, one was launched with infected Word documents posing as CVs. The hackers are also using exploit kits, which automatically attempt to infect PCs by attempting to run attacks on a large number of known vulnerabilities, typically from hacked websites. Palo Alto found evidence the 15 million-strong botnet was partly delivered via malicious online advertisements.It's not just PCs that hackers are recruiting for their mining machinations. In November last year, Forbes spoke with one Russian developer who had the power to turn 100,000 Android phones into cryptocurrency miners. He believed what he was doing was not illegal, and there's some debate about whether anyone would be prosecuted for using up compute power in such a way. (Though without permission, it's illegal to access others' computers in the U.S. and could well be deemed criminal).For the average user then, sensible hygiene when using the internet on computer or smartphone is recommended. It could go some way to helping killing the criminal cryptomining bonanza."

I've pulled together a list of some of the most relevant and interesting terms associated with cryptocurrency for reference.This is by no means a comprehensive list, as new words and phrases pop up frequently. Be on the lookout for Volume Two of this glossary sometime in the future.Address — An online location (presented in a random string of numbers and letters) where Bitcoin and other cryptos can be sent to and from.Alt-coin — A cryptocurrency alternative to Bitcoin including Litecoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP (commonly referred to as Ripple), and more.Blockchain — An online ledger containing records (also known as blocks) of every crypto transaction. The blockchain is public and decentralized, and is maintained by a peer-to-peer network of computers.Coinbase — A popular website and app used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.Cold storage — Keeping a reserve of crypto offline for security reasons. This could be a private key written on a piece of paper or stored on a USB flash drive. Obviously, this holds the potential for tremendous risk as the physical storage method can be lost, stolen, damaged or thrown out.DYOR - ""Do Your Own Research."" Cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and a potential buyer should be prepared to lose their entire investment. It's essential to do your own research before committing resources to any investment vehicle, especially one as volatile as cryptos.Fiat currency — A currency that is usually backed by a government or group and whose value is tied to the investing public's confidence in the government that backs it. The United States dollar changed from a fixed currency (backed by gold) to fiat in the 1970's. Cryptocurrencies are fiat currencies that are not backed by any government — their value is determined by those who trade them and the confidence that the value will increase over time.FOMO — ""Fear Of Missing Out."" An emotion experienced by those who haven't bought any cryptocurrency and see prices continually rising. Can lead to irrational buying at inflated prices.Fork — Splits in the blockchain are possible when two separate computers create a block at the same time. Since both blocks are authentic, new blocks can then be built on the resulting split, known as a fork.FUD — ""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt."" Three powerful emotions that can lead to irrational trading decisions.FUDster — Someone who spreads FUDHODL — ""HODL"" is derived from a drunken typo on a message board and has become a folksy rallying cry for those who have held onto Bitcoin throughout its extreme volatility. Though it was initially a misspelled version of ""HOLD,"" an ensuing acronym was created: ""Hold On for Dear Life.""ICO — ""Initial Coin Offering."" Similar in theory to an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of a stock, an ICO occurs when someone plans on creating a new cryptocoin and wants to start selling it to the public.LAMBO — Abbreviation for Lamborghini. As in, ""I'm going to buy a Lambo with all of my profits trading Bitcoin.""Mining — The process of creating blocks for the blockchain, which requires an inordinate amount of energy. As reported by CBS News, ""Nearly 10 U.S. households can be powered for one day by the electricity consumed for a single bitcoin transaction, according to figures from The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index.""Mooning — When the price of a coin rapidly increases in value, it's ""shooting up to the moon"" or ""mooning.""PoW — ""Proof of Work."" According to Decryptionary, ""with proof of work, computers compete to solve a tough math problem. The first computer that does this is allowed to create new blocks and record information."" The miner is then usually rewarded via transaction fees.Satoshi — The smallest unit of Bitcoin, named after the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. One Satoshi is worth 0.00000001 Bitcoin.Tank — The opposite of ""mooning."" When there is a crash in a crypto, it is said to be ""tanking.""Wallet — A place to securely lock away your cryptocurrency private keys.Disclosure: The author owns Bitcoin, Ethereum and XRP"

Bitcoin's recent rise and booming investor interest is forcing the regulatory and stock market authorities to formulate an official position on bitcoin and other virtual currencies. (Photo credit should read JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP/Getty Images)","A stock trading platform with algorithmic recommendations has just made it easier to manage cryptocurrency holdings alongside traditional financial securities.New York-based Commandiv recently launched a Coinbase integration feature that allows investors to trade stocks, funds and cryptocurrencies on a single platform and through one account. Coinbase operates one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the United States.“The idea is managing your wealth together in one central fashion, where you can buy and sell stocks, buy and sell crypto assets, while getting trade recommendations on all of them,” says Commandiv CEO and Co-Founder John Zettler, billing the combined crypto and stock trading platform as the first of its kind. “Commandiv is out to serve a new generation of wealth, one that sees the future in cryptocurrencies as much as in traditional brokerage,” the firm said in a Tuesday statement.Attune to the cryptocurrency market’s instability of present, Commandiv’s portfolios are designed with volatility in mind. Users begin by filling out a questionnaire that assigns them a risk tolerance metric, dubbed a “grit score,” which is then used alongside the information provided to determine a recommended target portfolio for the client’s securities. Meanwhile on the crypto side, clients indicate desired percentage holdings for supported cryptocurrencies.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]“Once you’ve made your target portfolio, we then constantly monitor your account’s investments and push the trades you need to move back into alignment with your target,” says Zettler, a former investment analyst for Morgan Stanley and New York hedge fund SeaStone Capital. “You’re the portfolio manager, and our software is the analyst and trader.”Reflecting Coinbase’s own crypto offerings, SEC-registered Commandiv supports Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin holdings. As of press time, Coinbase had not returned a Monday request for comment.Commandiv’s Coinbase integration has been active since last month. But despite the platform’s current crypto direction, Zettler’s original intention wasn’t to create a cryptocurrency and stock trading platform. When Commandiv, which currently claims about $500,000 in assets under advisement, initially launched in June of last year, it was a securities-only product -- but that limitation left out a large pool of clients’ actively traded holdings.“We just kept hearing, ‘crypto,' 'crypto,' 'crypto’ from our clients -- so much that we ended up doing a survey where we found out that about 75 percent of them were actively investing in crypto assets,” Zettler says. The firm says it now has about $60,000 in Coinbase assets linked up to its platform.Commandiv’s roots trace back to Zettler’s time at SeaStone Capital, when Zettler says that for his personal investments, he knew which strategies he wanted and the allocations he desired, but didn’t have time to actually maintain his own portfolio that consistently rebalanced itself to execute on both fronts. After Zettler left SeaStone in 2015, he built the technology to do just that as a programmatic solution on top of his wealth management platform of choice, Interactive Brokers. “So then I started offering it to my friends, saying ‘hey, you just tell me what you want to be invested in, I’ll plug in your positions and then output all the trades',” he says. “Eventually, the number of people coming back to me asking for the trade recommendations became large enough to where I saw that this was an actual company.”Algorithmic trading was the draw for 27-year-old James Underhill, who manages his traditional brokerage funds, IRA and now Coinbase account on the platform. ""It allows for me to get a birds-eye view on my entire portfolio, inclusive of my crypto assets which are traditionally not linked to any finance platform... So I can see how much my crypto assets are versus traditional domestic stocks and international growth markets, and be able to balance that out, take profits off the table and make sure I'm not too leveraged in any particular asset class."" A consolidated platform for crypto and stocks along with rebalancing tools were similar draws for Fordham University finance student Naasik Islam, who first met Zettler at a New York co-working space and now also primarily manages his investments via Commandiv. They're prime examples of the busy, young professionals with investment opinions that Commandiv targets.CommandivOn the broader front, moves to facilitate cryptocurrency integration with existing trading platforms have been cautiously slow, and understandably so. While the market’s certainly moved in a direction that may encourage activity from large banks and trading firms, regulatory uncertainty and volatility pose risks that may trickle down to the firms’ firmly grounded core business lines.Coinbase and Fidelity Investments announced in August that the two were testing a feature to allow Fidelity customers with Coinbase accounts to view their crypto asset balances in their Fidelity portfolio summaries. “Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies are emerging from their infancy but mass adoption is still many years away. And don’t underestimate their disruptive nature,"" said Fidelity Labs Managing Director and Senior Vice President Hadley Stern at the time. The partnership was carefully introduced as a pilot to, as stated in the release, discover whether digital asset holdings should play a role in one's overall financial picture.Meanwhile, the lines between traditional asset and cryptocurrency are drawn for Commandiv as well. “When it comes to the crypto side, we don’t give investment advice, we only provide rebalancing software. Similarly, we don’t charge any advisory fees on the crypto assets that are linked up to the account,” says Zettler. “What we allow clients to do is trade the crypto and use our rebalancing software so that they can set their own target portfolio and manage their wealth more easily on the crypto side.”For Commandiv’s future, Zettler says that as competition sprouts up in the combined crypto- and stock-trading field, the firm sees an opportunity to eventually broaden the number of tradeable crypto assets on its platform, allow coin-to-coin trading and provide greater fiat liquidity.And when it comes to investing in a volatile, new market, tried-and-true diversification is key, says Zettler. “Keep any investment in the crypto space as a small and manageable percentage of your total wealth so that if it cut in half, it wouldn’t keep you awake at night.“I have seen what has happened to individuals who’ve lost large amounts of money in the dot-com crash and in the latest financial crisis. And generally, the people who did the worst and lost the most in both of those crashes were those who had all of their eggs in one basket.”"

Because it ...","Jan 10, 2018,07:30am EST",Shutterstock,"As someone who's been involved in the cryptocurrency markets since Bitcoin was valued at $70 in 2013, I have since contributed as a community advocate, a technical recruiter, an investor and crypto trader. While tokens are considered digital currencies, they are also asynchronous, distributed platforms facilitating the disruption of many industries. Technology startups and more established enterprise companies that adopt and adapt to blockchain technology will be well positioned to compete and win the war for talent. But first, let's discuss the state of crypto markets, which have been dictated by volatility, geopolitics and, of course, technology.For any given currency to have value, it needs to be backed up by the nation or federal government it belongs to. The same concept can be applied to cryptocurrencies with only one major difference: The value is given to it by the people themselves. As decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum become mainstream, gaining more prominence in the public eye, traditional centralized finance and banking institutions are starting to push back. The battleground lies in the hearts and minds of consumers. The ammunition? News.It is undeniable that cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the pack, have grown tremendously in the past quarter. Not only did Bitcoin triple in value in 2017, but it recently reached $20,000. There are now close to 1,400 cryptocurrencies that have a combined worth of around $300 billion. To top it off, on December 10, the Cboe Futures Exchange listed the first Bitcoin futures on its platform, which unsurprisingly caused the site to crash within the first few hours of it being listed. By some estimates, the cryptocurrency industry could be worth $5 trillion by 2022. But as the market is extremely volatile, that number is ever-changing as well is dependent on what source of news you listen to.Dirty Digital Money?The skepticism surrounding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has always been present due to their use on the dark web and various nefarious online marketplaces like Silk Road. However, the controversy became even more prominent as we moved into Q4 2017. In September, China banned companies from raising money through ICOs, investigating 60 crypto marketplaces, while halting the creation of new projects that raise cash or other virtual currencies through cryptocurrencies. Regulators warned consumers about money laundering, criminal cyber activity and fraud.Following China’s lead, Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke out against wide acceptance of cryptocurrencies due to the “serious risks” they carry. That being said, he proposed a regulatory system for ICOs and cryptocurrencies that will make it possible ""to make relations in this sphere systemic, definitely protect interests of citizens, business and the government, and provide legal guarantees for work with innovative financial instruments.”Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, initially publicly dismissed Bitcoin as “a fraud” and “not a real thing.” Although such claims were not backed up by any substantial data, the accusations were predictable, as Dimon leads a company that is highly vested in traditional banking. However, Dimon now faces market abuse charges as Blockswater, an algorithmic liquidity provider, filed a complaint that he was deliberately spreading false information to artificially lower the price of Bitcoin so that Dimon and other large banks could come in and buy BTC on the dip.In a counterargument to the above statements, Bitcoin supporters are urging regulators to not jump the gun and try to understand the space better in order to not stifle innovation.Mining Money Out Of Thin Air? Not Quite ...Unlike fiat currency, which is printed paper money, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created through rigs (PCs) that mine for new coins through a series of tasks, known as proof-of-work.Massive amounts of supercomputing power and electricity are used in creating Bitcoins. John McAffee, who is quickly becoming the face of the cryptocurrency movement, stated the following quote in response to Dimon’s allegations:“I'm a Bitcoin miner. We create Bitcoins. It costs over $1,000 per coin to create a Bitcoin. What does it cost to create a U.S. dollar? Which one is the fraud? Because it costs whatever the paper costs, but it costs me and other miners over $1,000 per coin. It's called proof of work.""Besides the high costs of mining each crypto block, some cryptocurrencies are also based on a deflationary market environment, with cryptocurrency having a limited amount of coins that could potentially be mined. Bitcoin has a 21 million coin cap, and currently, there are 16,734,300 bitcoins in circulation. On average, 12.5 Bitcoins are being added to the total supply every 10 minutes.Old School Versus New SchoolThere are two opposing sides when it comes to speculating what the future of the cryptocurrency industry will hold. Cryptocurrency believers claim Bitcoin will fundamentally alter payments, economics and even politics around the world; they welcome disruption and innovation and are willing to take the risks associated with these endeavors.Skeptics claim Bitcoin is inherently broken and will suffer inevitable collapses and bubbles. Thus far, its use has been dominating in countries with volatile national currencies like Nigeria, Bolivia and Venezuela. However, there is no exact way to predict what kind of impact it will continue having on not only the countries with failing currencies but strong economies as well.How Did Bitcoin Succeed?Bitcoin succeeded where hundreds of other cryptography-based currencies and digital money failed because of the community of passionate users and developers who shared the open-source technology. This approach incredibly different from previous attempts at digital cash, whose stakeholders were, in large part, only within the company itself. When these employees left or the company got shut down, their ideas died with them. Luckily, Bitcoin’s success is due in large part to the enthusiastic supporting community of people who advanced the technology, generated interest and persuaded merchants to adopt it.What's Next? In a future article, we will discuss how organizations can adopt the technology behind cryptocurrencies and compete to attract and retain top talent with it as well as focus on the implications if they don't."

Enter Plantoid: an art project made up of metal sculptural parts, as well as software embedded directly on a blockchain. Billed as a “blockchain-based life form,” Plantoid was created by Primavera De Filippi to visualize her academic research on blockchain technology.","Primavera De FilippiOn the face of it, Plantoid looks like a series of plant-like metal sculptures. Each one of these is associated with a unique digital wallet that accepts cryptocurrency (Bitcoin or Ethereum for now), and viewers are encouraged to send digital money to any of the sculptures they find beautiful or evocative. When a predetermined amount of money collects in one of these wallets, a piece of software triggers a process by which a new artist is commissioned to create another metal sculpture that will be part of Plantoid.Any artist who wants to be considered for such a commission needs a digital wallet that accepts Bitcoin or Ethereum, and a way to plug into Plantoid’s process for submitting proposals. Once triggered, Plantoid does the rest: its software finds all the people who have sent in a proposal, chooses one of these people, and transfers funds in its wallet to that artist. It then generates a new wallet for this new instance of Plantoid, so it can collect funds of its own.Potentially, the commissioning process can be triggered an endless amount of times, as a Plantoid wallet fills up and then empties again. And it’s the potential here that makes discussing the project with De Filippi a delightful foray into metaphorical language: according to her, Plantoid is the “plant equivalent of an android,” which “lives” on a blockchain, “feeds” on cryptocurrency and can “reproduce,” autonomously generating new Plantoid that themselves live, feed, and reproduce on the same blockchain. The metaphors are a way of describing what is striking about the underlying software: it reproduces itself on its own—something we associate with biological processes like cell division.Two instances of PlantoidDe Filippi is a Faculty Associate at the Berkman-Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University who studies the legal implications of “smart” contracts—which is blockchain terminology for contracts written as software rather than as legal text. The automated process by which an artist is commissioned to create a new Plantoid is an example such smart contracts executing themselves. Because people can interact with Plantoid in only two fixed ways—by sending it funds, or by receiving a commission from it—there is no single person who can influence the entire cycle of Plantoid’s “reproduction,” rendering it, essentially, autonomous.De Filippi built each of the six Plantoid sculptures that now exist (five are outcomes of the original Plantoid’s “reproduction”), but hopes eventually more artists can be part of the manufacture of these sculptures once she has build a web interface for artists to plug into its commissioning structure. She is a TEDx speaker, a Researcher at the National Center of Scientific Research in Paris, and co-founder of the Internet Governance Forum’s dynamic coalitions on Blockchain Technology (COALA). Together with the artistic collective Okhaos, she frequently produces interactive electro-mechanical sculptures that illustrate her research.I sat down with De Filippi to find out more about the life and times of Plantoid, and the surprising funding model it proposes for commissioning artworks.Kat Mustatea: Why create sculpture as a physical manifestation of blockchain?Primavera De Filippi: For one, because I’ve always been doing sculptures. And secondly, because, I mean, what else? If the goal is to instantiate the blockchain in the physical world, then it makes sense to make it a physical thing.Mustatea: How does payment work for the artists making a Plantoid?De Filippi:  The idea with the Plantoid is to shift the focus away from the artist and towards the art piece. You normally fund an artist in the hopes that he’s going to keep doing art that you like. But if you’re funding the art piece, then it is up to whatever governance model is encoded into this art piece to decide who should be the artist that is entitled to create this piece. Of course, there needs to be a positive incentivization scheme for every artist to try and make the most beautiful, the most interesting Plantoid possible.Mustatea: Right. How do you ensure an artist paid to build a Plantoid actually builds it?De Filippi: Every artist knows that whenever the Plantoid they created reproduces itself, they will also earn a small percentage, a small royalty for every descendant of this Plantoid that people fund. Then the artist has the incentive of making the most amazing Plantoid possible—maybe even spending more than the amount they have been commissioned for, because there is also the ability to profit from a descendant Plantoid after the fact. So that is the positive incentivization scheme for the artist: the better the Plantoid they make, the more it’s going to reproduce itself, and therefore the more royalties will come back to the artist.Mustatea: How much money does it take to instantiate a new Plantoid?De Filippi: It depends on the Plantoid. The first Plantoid required half a Bitcoin. That was nothing back then, but now, that’s really expensive because the value of Bitcoin has gone up. For the other Plantoids, it’s between one quarter of a Bitcoin to one Bitcoin. [Note: as of publication, 1 Bitcoin = $10,000 USD].Mustatea: How do you determine the location of a Plantoid?De Filippi: At the moment, it’s arbitrary. It’s basically me: I just try to put the Plantoid in places where it is publicly accessible, ideally where it might be able to interact with people that have cryptocurrencies. In the next version of the Plantoid, I will probably implement a governance structure in which everyone that has been funding it has a say—proportionate to their funding—and can vote on its next location.Mustatea: In much of art history, a group’s idea of what is beautiful is often at odds with an individual artist’s unique creative vision. How does Plantoid's logic deal with this?De Filippi: The design of the Plantoid is based on the concept of evolutionary Darwinism: the Plantoid that is the most fit to its environment is the one that will reproduce. So an artist, of course, can add his own artistic stamp, his own preferences, his own style to the Plantoid he builds. But the goal is not that the artist is satisfied with the Plantoid; the goal is that the Plantoid reproduces itself. In this case, the tastes of the public, in terms of aesthetics, in terms of what is the governance model, and so forth, is actually more important—because the Plantoid feeds on this system. And if it’s not a good fit for the system, it is not going to get any funds, and then it’s not going to reproduce itself.Mustatea: What is your hope for Plantoid, say, five years from now?De Filippi: I would hope that it keeps evolving. And that I’m no longer the one making them.

Dallas Mavericks owner, tech billionaire, and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban announced on Monday that fans will soon be able to purchase season tickets to Mavericks games with cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin and ethereum (“Ether”) come the 2018-2019 season.Mark Cuban was kind enough to allow me to interview him about why this move towards crypto is not just a smart investment for him, but for his team, and the NBA.What Is 'Cryptocurrency'?
“Cryptocurrency” is a digital/virtual currency that is designed to work as an unregulated, decentralized medium of exchange. It uses coding (“cryptography”) to secure and verify each individual transaction. The idea behind this market is to entertain a decentralized digital cash system without a central entity controlling its flow.The digital currency requires a payment portal/network, recording a ledger of expenditures and balances on a centralized server, e.g. PayPal. However, in a decentralized network, there is no server. Rather, every computer on the network needs to have its own ledger containing all the transactions.Crypto-Craze: Today’s Global Phenomenon Of 'Crypto-Vesting'If you’ve invested in any cryptocurrency, what you really have is a private key/password and a public key/password to its physical address on the blockchain (public ledger), allowing for the holder to withdraw the currency to spend or trade. But, without the password, the individual cannot access his or her funds. Bottom line is, don’t lose it. The blockchain contains all trades, expenditures, letting others know how much value has been exchanged. For security purposes, the identity of the individuals behind the transactions are hidden.Today, the idea of digital currency has become a global phenomenon to both the consumer and to venture capitalists such as Mark Cuban. While most people, businesses, banks, and governments are still trying to understand its purpose, how it functions, and how to even consider implementing it in relation to our centralized currency, they still recognize its important in the marketplace.“We want to make our products and services how and where our customers want to buy it.” —Mark Cuban, Owner of the Dallas MavericksWhat businesses, consumers, and even the government are still trying to wrap their heads around is whether it’s actually possible to remove the central authority and still have the ability to create/declare a valuation and state of balances. Despite these questions, investors like Cuban continue to believe and ride the bubble of the early success of these currencies like bitcoin (“BTC”), litecoin (“LTC’), ethereum (“Ether”), and ripple are bringing.Inside The Shark Tank With Tech Billionaire And Crypto-Shark Mark CubanShark Tank on the ABC Television Network.

 announcement January 15, informing Dallas fans that they could soon expect to purchase tickets with bitcoin and ether as early as next season, and his thoughts on the current state of the cryptocurrency market and why he has chosen to bring the Mavericks franchise into it.The crypto market has continued to draw the attention of venture capitalists such as Shark Tank investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Cuban recently backed a new venture capital fund for cryptocurrency-related investments called “1confirmation.”When asked on his thoughts on the current state of the bitcoin market, Cuban responded that “…it’s a collectibles market. The more buyers, the higher the price. In that way, it’s very similar to gold, art, and other collectibles.”Since the beginning, Cuban has stood by the notion that the crypto market is heavily influenced by the actions of the buyers. When one buys, many buy; when people sell, others sell.Businesses such as Facebook are beginning to look into cryptocurrency and whether or not its worth opening their systems up to. In his 2018 mission statement, Mark Zuckerberg wrote that he’s “interested in going deeper and study[ing] the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in [their] services.”Andrew Rossow: Why do you think it’s beneficial for businesses, and even sports organizations such as the NBA to consider entering into the cryptocurrency market?Mark Cuban: For the same reason that content owners stream their content—you want to provide your product, [specifying] how and where they want to receive it. The same applies to crypto. We want to make our products and services how and where our customers want to buy it. If they wanted to pay in blueberries and I thought it made economic sense, I would let them pay in blueberries.Investors such as Mark Cuban and Robert Hervajec also understand that going deeper into these technologies requires understanding the risks associated with them, such as learning how to control and implement them.“Invest in the infrastructure, not the speculation,” says Robert Herjavec, CEO of Herjavec Group. You’re not just talking about how to transition currencies, but transitioning an entire way of thinking on the minds of consumers, organizations, and most importantly, financial institutions.Nikola Jokic #15 of the Denver Nuggets and Dirk Nowitzki #41 of the Dallas Mavericks during the game... [+] on January 16, 2018 at the Pepsi Center in Denver, Colorado. (Garrett Ellwood/NBAE via Getty Images)Since the beginning, Cuban has pushed for growth, development, and success from not just his team, but from his business ventures and most importantly, his customers. His undying loyalty to his team and fans has earned him a warm spot in Dallas fans’ hearts. When it comes down to success in business, “you have to re-earn your customers business every day,” says Cuban.Rossow: Why would this [move] be a good thing for Dallas sports fans and the Mavericks organization as a whole?Cuban: …[W]e want to allow customers to buy how they want to buy. As long as we can hedge or exchange the payment method and it works with our payment gateway, we will accept it as payment.Like the Sacramento Kings, the Mavericks will join as the second NBA team to enter into the crypto market.Cuban continues to lead his organization in a positive direction, ensuring that the Mavericks continue to grow and develop, but most importantly, reminding fans that without their loyalty, support, and patronage, the organization would not be what it is today.Since the crypto-craze began, millennials have been investing their funds in various cryptocurrency markets, most notably, Litecoin and Ripple. When asked whether this is a good starting point for millennials to begin building a portfolio with, Cuban warned against this.Rossow: Do you feel this is a good starting point for teens and millennials to start building a portfolio, even if it’s not a regulated currency?Cuban: No. This is still a very volatile place to put money. You have to be able to afford to lose it.Emphasizing Cuban’s point on the volatility of the market, the entire crypto market fell by double-digit percentages. Bitcoin dropped by 15%, falling to below $12,000 for the first time since December 4, 2017; Ether dropped by over 20%, hovering right above $1,000, and Ripple fell by 33%, dropping to $1.23 at the time. These price drops have a huge impact, which goes to show the direct correlation between number of buyers and the inescapable thoughts plaguing consumers on when these markets may crash.As Cuban has indicated in the past, “you need to do some homework before you ask business questions.” "

[+] Japan's government said on January 29 it would impose administrative measures on virtual currency exchange Coincheck after hackers stole hundreds of millions of dollars in digital assets from the Tokyo-based firm. (AFP/Getty Images),"Japan-based Coincheck, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan, was infiltrated on January 26, resulting in the loss of $534 million in XEM, the native cryptocurrency of NEM. But the speed at which Coincheck and the NEM Foundation acted to mitigate the damage of the largest cryptocurrency hack of all time is something worth exploring. Compare this incident to high profile hacks in the past -- Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which once handled 80% of the world’s Bitcoin trades, filed for bankruptcy after losing 850,000 Bitcoins – worth roughly $450 million in 2014. Last month, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Youbit also filed for bankruptcy after being hacked twice last year.While the previous hacks were smaller they were actually more damaging to the crypto-economy because the losses presented significantly larger percentages of the amount of crypto in circulation. Plus while this recent hack is still under investigation, there is still a chance the XEM may be recovered.Circumventing hack attacks Jeff McDonald, Vice President of the NEM Foundation examined Coincheck's situation carefully and speaks about how similar instances can be avoided in the future. He admited NEM was already working with Coincheck before the media picked up the story. The exchange called them in for help and advice as soon as the breach was discovered. “Due to the nature of NEM’s architecture and its advanced API, we were able to devise a rapidly executed plan that succeeded in giving us a full account of all the stolen XEM,"" he said. ""But for obvious reasons we can not disclose at this time the exact method of the attack.” He went on to explain that it's easy to tell on the blockchain within minutes what has been going on.Polyswarm CEO Steve Bassi also weighed in on the Coincheck exchange hack: “Exchanges are complex software marketplaces, sometimes integrating hardware as well, and security is an enormous task.” Polyswarm is a decentralized cyber threat detection platform that is studying confidentiality controls in a blockchain environment, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.ShutterstockBassi explained that third-party audits would be a great asset for any exchange. They should come from multiple parties and include both physical and software components.  For best results, technical staff at the exchange should not be warned in advance of an audit so that they can be tested randomly on discovering and reacting to a breach.Limits on 'hot wallets'We now know that one of the key issues leading to the breach was the use of a hot wallet, a digital wallet connected to the Internet where bitcoin-related services and exchanges can be paid out or withdrawn instantly. One safeguard that may help exchanges prevent future such attempts would be to limit the amount that can be held in a hot wallet at any given time.Many people in the crypto-community have been asking whether NEM will hard fork to return the tokens to the original owners. McDonald clarified that NEM wasn’t at fault for the hack: “We have identified 10 different accounts the tokens went into. We tagged all the coins so anyone who attempts to purchase them will know they were stolen from Coincheck and should not be purchased. We also have other strategies that we cannot disclose fully at this time. But it does involve an automated system that will follow the coins and tag any accounts that receive the coins.”McDonald believes third-party audits are needed and that exchanges still require best practices such as keeping the bulk of crypto in offline cold storage. Coincheck was the only Japanese Exchange not approved or licensed by the FSA (Financial Services Agency). That is something that will be more closely examined moving forward.Coincheck has reported that they intend to refund the stolen funds to nearly 260,000 users from their own capital."

There are three things which drive its absurd power use: artificial scarcity leading to many, many miners, it’s increasingly hard competition for the remaining few million coins and its proof-of-work approach to immutability and validity. There’s no inherent value in Bitcoin, it’s slow to transact and it’s expensive to transact. It will turn into a rarely turned over asset like fine art paintings in a specialty market, but will peak soon if it hasn’t already. Proof-of-work is an already obsolete approach to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.The Bitcoin problem, in other words is a multiplying problem: high energy to discover the solution * many, many people trying to discover the solution * proof-of-work. It’s inefficient and inelegant from a resources perspective, while being elegant as a first mover on the Byzantine Generals’ problem.Ethereum is bubbly but its consumption is about to drop radically. It has been using proof-of-work, but is about to move to its Casper proof-of-stake model which will reduce mining competition and the like substantially. Ethereum’s electricity consumption will drop by orders of magnitude. Casper will be a hard fork so while the old stuff will still be around, its problems will become more and more apparent. There will be a lot of secondary coins created on the Ethereum model which won’t follow the hard fork, but they are also secondary consumers.NEO and Hyperledger are next-generation with even lower electricity costs and attendant carbon footprints.NEO uses delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) which is an even more optimized proof-of-stake. It mostly randomly gives miners with high stakes in NEO the right to generate the next block, hence the delegation. This is much lower energy and allows higher transaction volumes as well.Hyperledger Fabric centralizes block creation into a single resource pool and has multiple validators in the participants. Validation is much easier than creation, and creation will be centralized on a single, optimized platform. It’s also not a crypto platform although VIVA did that. It’s an enterprise collaboration engine, using blockchain smart contracts and an externalized payment system where that’s necessary, allowing variants of net 30 terms most crypto smart contracts don’t support.So all of the hysteria about cryptocurrency energy use is going to go away in the next few months. The bubble will pop for stale assets like bitcoin, places like China will clamp down on wasting electricity on competitive mining and everybody else will move to variants of proof-of-stake or perhaps IOTA which seems to dodge the bullet in a different way.This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

If you learn nothing else from me today, take that bit to heart.Cryptocurrency, a word that we dimly learned when the world started waking up to Bitcoin, has had an on-again / off-again fling with consumer PC hardware for the past several years. Right now, not only is it on-again, it’s ratcheted things up from casual fling to front page torrid affair.What’s going on? When will the madness end? Is cryptocurrency on consumer hardware the power couple of 2018?We’ve been here beforeLet’s rewind the clock a little bit to the Autumn romance of 2013: Bitcoin is showing itself to be more than a passing fad and things are starting to feel real. 2013 was the year that you could buy things with cryptocurrency with retailers like Newegg stepping in and giving the strange idea a special kind of legitimacy.2013 was also the year that AMD made a desperate bid for market share at the high end of the gaming GPU market with the R9–290X, aiming squarely at Nvidia’s GTX 780 and massively undercutting the price. Or, at least they tried to. [1]Nvidia’s GTX 7xx series of Kepler GPUs managed to be the last of an era for Nvidia: An era when the compute performance of their consumer GPUs was (likely) artificially handicapped to protect their Quadro and Tesla product lines.The result was a rush on AMD GPUs as people desperate to get on the cryptocurrency bandwagon scrambled to find their piece of the pie, California gold rush style.The price of AMD GPUs soared as retailers marked the cards up significantly over MSRP, selling a product once targeted at PC Gaming enthusiasts to a new class of customer who was willing to reach into deeper pockets because this wasn’t entertainment, this was an investment.It wasn’t just Bitcoin, which was already moving towards ASIC based mining, by January of 2014 we’d see the highest price on newcomer Litecoin that it’s traded at until, well, last year.In Q4 2013 and Q1 2014, you could find overpriced graphics cards being sold in 3 and 4 packs with a powersupply and the cheapest CPUs you could find with retailers trying to cater to the would be miner.Of course, it didn’t last. Gamers screamed and AMD watched their market share dwindle as gamers bought the only thing they could: Nvidia products. By the time AMD stepped in with retailers to get pricing under control, the bubble had largely passed, flooding the market with used GPUs as the early rush miners converted their GPU mining investment into an ASIC solution… or grew bored with the amount of math involved in trying to figure out if you were actually spending more on electricity than you were making with your mining rig.This time, things are differentThe bubble of 2013/2014 was forgotten relatively quickly as new GPUs launched and cryptocurrency stayed confined to ASICs. In 2014, Intel launched their X99 platform and with it, insanely expensive DDR4, Nvidia gave us the GTX 9xx series and AMD pulled back to lick their wounds of being too successful in the wrong way.So what’s making 2017’s rekindling of a forgotten romance turn into 2018’s blazing passion? This time, the bubble didn’t pop. There are more players on the board and some of those players have introduced forms of cryptocurrency that are difficult to mine on ASIC based solutions.You have to remember that part of the appeal of cryptocurrency mining is that it was an ‘everyman’s’ chance to make some money. A little consumer hardware, your home computer crunching away while you were at work or sleeping… People want that dream of striking it, well, maybe rich, but if not rich, making money for doing effectively nothing other than watch the mining rig do its thing and not letting it catch fire. On that dream, the market has delivered and the GPU is once again king of a new generation of cryptocurrencies.This time, the OEMs want to playIn the bubble of 2013/2014, the biggest winners in PC hardware were retailers. It demonstrated, however, that people who see cryptocurrency as a gold rush will pay more than the traditional consumer of components for custom PCs. 2013/2014 showed us that the deep pockets are there… and 2017’s rise of cryptocurrencies gave OEMs time to develop some purpose built hardware, just for miners.The insanity we find on the shelvesIf you told me back in 2014 that I’d be seeing system boards with 19 PCIe slots.. and not just 19 PCIe slots but 3 ATX connectors so you can connect three separate power supplies to a single board. I’d probably have called you crazy. In 2018… you can buy one for around $400, assuming you can find one on the shelves somewhere.Of course, not everyone wants to have three power supplies plugged into their mining rack, so, EVGA has given us another dose of insanity in the form of an 80+ Platinum 2200 watt power supply. Of course, you’ll need a 220v outlet to plug the monster into.And what about GPUs?This time, Nvidia isn’t immune to the impact of miners which means that there’s no stabilizing influence in the GPU market. Both AMD and Nvidia GPUs are flying off the shelves at prices that are, once again, well over MSRP.The GTX 1080 Ti carries an MSRP of $699 for your most basic editions of the card. Now… Well, you can buy one for $1,200, assuming that you can find any in stock.The impact isn’t just on the high end. It reaches down quite a ways. Even the consumer friendly ‘sweet spot’ cards, typically priced close to $200 are seeing significant price inflation relative to their target MSRPs.For gamers looking for the kind of performance they could get from a flagship card, people are once again looking to SLI / Crossfire solutions, pairing multiple lower end cards to get closer to the performance of the unobtainable flagships. It’s a poor solution, we all know that games don’t always scale well across multiple cards and that you’re better off with a higher end single card… but if there’s nothing else available to buy, what are you going to do?When will the madness end?I wish I had a crystal ball for this. Last time, the bubble hit the market hard for between 6 and 9 months before the bubble popped. This time… it feels like we’re still seeing this rush get a full head of steam.My hope, truthfully, is that we’ll see a rise of more specialty hardware like the Asus BTC Mining Expert and the EVGA 2200P2. We’re already starting to see mining GPUs emerge without so much as a single port to connect a display to:If the custom hardware gets enough better than the general purpose consumer hardware then the pressure will come off the custom PC market and we can get back to… normal?But what if I need a new computer now?Don’t build one. Just don’t.There is something you can do though.While I’m not normally a fan of gaming laptops, the laptop market is largely isolated from the hammer hitting the parts market for custom desktop PCs. No one wants to mine with a laptop unless it’s a laptop they happen to have lying around because the ROI for mining with a gaming laptop is really poor.Gaming laptops have been getting more and more capable and we’re seeing several laptops on the market that can drive even enthusiast gaming setups with triple monitors and all the extras a gamer expects from a high end desktop.It’s still more expensive than what a gaming desktop ‘should cost’ but… if you find yourself needing a new gaming computer for the first half of 2018… I’d suggest looking at a laptop.AddendumA few commenters have brought up the resale value of gaming cards as a reason that dedicated mining GPUs won't take off since gamers can't use them. There's some truth to that in the sense that right now, if you were building a mining rig, the ROI gap between a mining card and a gaming card isn't compelling. But, and this is important for any would be miners to understand: At it's core, cryptocurrency is and always will be a math problem.Let's be hypothetical for a moment. Let's say that you buy a GTX 1080 today for $1000 and that in three months of mining, it pays itself off. In three more months, you've mined another $1000 of cryptocurrency and you sell the card for half of MSRP: $250. Now we math: $2000 from cryptocurrency you mined, plus $250 from reselling the card, minus the $1000 you paid gives you a net profit of $1,250. Not bad.Now, let's say you had an alternative. For $500 you can buy a mining card that will perform just as well as the GTX 1080, but you can't resell it. At the end of six months, you've mined $2,000 in cryptocurrency, paid $500 for hardware and have a net profit of $1,500.Which would you do?Now, today, such a card doesn't exist. But, remember what I said at the beginning about being here before? The move from GPU mining to ASIC mining in 2014 occurred because the math made it inevitable. of course, the real world is more complicated than this example with considerations like cost of electricity, physical space, air conditioning… At the end of the day though, it's math. When the math says dedicated hardware is more profitable, professional miners will move on and the hobby miner that still wants to resell cards will either give up because they're losing money or will be few enough in number to not affect the hardware market as significantly.I happen to think it's inevitable. When there's this much money involved, people will look for ways to increase profitability and dedicated hardware is a way to do exactly that.Footnotes[1] Why Did NVIDIA Win The GPU Market?This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

A graphics card can execute thousands more instructions-per-clock than a CPU, which makes the vast majority of algorithms associated with cryptocurrency mining dramatically more ideal for GPUs. In a nutshell: the dominant narrative is that GPUs are much more profitable for mining. AMD wants to shift that narrative using Threadripper as the focal point.","After I wrote this article illustrating how much money (in U.S. dollars, not digital coin) you stand to make with the graphics cards in your existing gaming PC, AMD reached out and basically said ""hey, you might be surprised what our Threadripper CPU can do.""AMD ThreadripperWe know AMD's Threadripper is a monster, designed for extreme multitasking. It's not easy to max that sucker out. Throw 4K gaming, video encoding, 1080p Twitch streaming, rendering, and gameplay recording at it simultaneously and it barely breaks a sweat. And we also know it has 32MB of L3 cache, which AMD Technical Marketing Manager Damien Triolet tells me is part of its secret mining sauce. I'll divulge more of that conversation soon, and extensively test Threadripper in my own mining environment for some sharable hard numbers.In the meantime, I wondered if Threadripper could earn you more profit with software like NiceHash than Nvidia's GTX 1080 can. (Note that NiceHash pays out in Bitcoin, which you can then transfer to an exchange like Coinbase for free, and then ultimately to your bank account).[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]When you mine with a CPU on NiceHash, you'll be throwing your hashing power at an algorithm called Cryptonight (the same one used to mine a crypto coin like Monero) because it was designed to cater to a CPU's strengths. I scoured various subreddits and Monerobenchmarks.info and determined that many users can reach a hashrate of at least 1300 H/s. If you plug in that hashrate under Cryptonight, enter an electricity cost of $0.10kW/h and input Threadripper's 180W TDP into the NiceHash profitability calculator at the time of this writing, you get a monthly profit of $99.79.Estimated monthly profit: Threadripper on NiceHashHowever, AMD's Triolet tells me their test Threadripper test system is pulling only 190W with the 1950X, 32GB of 2133MHz DDR4 RAM, and a Radeon RX Vega idling.Using the same profitability calculator at the same time of writing (in other words, capturing Bitcoin's current value for both estimates ), an Nvidia GTX 1080 delivers an estimated $94.56. Have in mind that with a GPU, NiceHash is constantly switching to the most profitable algorithm every 90 seconds to maximize your earnings.Estimated monthly profit: GTX 1080 on NiceHashI realize there are many variables that can influence and alter these estimates, such as how many threads you devote to the task on Threadripper, general optimizations, the memory clock and power levels of your GTX 1080, and the fluctuating price of various cryptocurrencies. But I like the value proposition anyway.What I'm dying to find out -- and what I'll be sharing once I do -- is how much you can achieve with Threadripper while still treating it as the CPU you do everything else with. When a GPU is mining, it's typically running full throttle (perhaps with some undervolting and clock tweaks) and is unusable for anything else. With Threadripper, could I see that ~$99/month profit and still have cores reserved for gaming, editing and working on random stuff? AMD suggests the answer is yes. This matters to me not just for the usability factor, but because the current cost of Threadripper is $899, while the GTX 1080 (in-stock that you can buy today) ranges from about $849 to $999.By the way, AMD mentioned that despite Threadripper coming in at the same price as the Core-i9 7900x, Intel's 10-core is 2.5x slower at mining. Again, a very interesting statement I look forward to proving or disproving."

From a technological ...","Editors' Pick|Jan 26, 2018,02:29am EST",(Photo Illustration by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images),"The Diffusion of Innovation Theory, first postulated by Everett Rogers in 1962, explains how an idea, product, or behavior takes root in society through different segments of a population. It starts slowly at first with the ""innovators"" and ""early adopters,"" who make up just 16% of the population; these are the intrepid individuals who see opportunities before they are there, who are willing to experiment, take huge risks, and change the status quo.After them, the innovation begins to gain traction and spreads exponentially to the ""early majority,"" who are more wary than the ones who came before but still eager to jump onboard. They are followed by the ""late majority""—a risk-averse and skeptical population—and finally, the ""laggards,"" the ones who are most resistant to change. At this point, the diffusion of innovation is complete—a new norm or product has achieved dominance in society. This model of adoption has occurred throughout history, from the rise of the iPhone to the abolishment of slavery.The Diffusion of Innovation Curve
Blockchain TodayWhere, then, should we situate blockchain on this curve? Many believe we are already in the ""early majority"" phase of exponential growth, and that we are on the cusp of full adoption. I wish to temper expectations and introduce more nuance into the equation. It is important that we examine the issue of blockchain adoption from two different angles: investments and technology. On the investments front, blockchain has indeed reached the level of ""early majority."" More and more capital, both institutional and household, is being poured into cryptocurrencies today. In 2017 alone, the total crypto market capitalization ballooned from 18 billion dollars to more than half a trillion dollars. Coinbase, the online exchange for buying and selling digital currency, recently reached more than 10 million users worldwide and became the most downloaded app on the U.S. Apple Store. Online wallet and portfolio tracking apps like imToken from China and CoinManager from Korea have also seen exponential expansion in their user base. In Korea, one of the largest crypto markets in the world, more than one-third of salaried workers are investors. CBOE and CME, two of the world’s largest financial exchanges, took the unprecedented step of launching Bitcoin futures last month. Across the globe, more than 2000 Bitcoin ATMs have sprouted up. The signs are clear.How Far Have We Really Come?From a technological perspective, however, we are still quite far behind. Firstly, there exists a dearth of talent. Blockchain developers are few and far between; the growth of many crypto-projects has been limited by the difficulty of finding qualified technologists. Secondly, there remain many technical issues that need to be ironed out, the most notable of which is scaling. Blockchain networks are still not capable of handling the high transaction volumes that could rival that of large industries and financial institutions. Without the appropriate scaling solutions, transactions costs would be too high and the wait times too long for viable adoption. This can be especially concerning, given that 2018 is the year where a lot of blockchain platforms start running on the Ethereum blockchain. The sudden influx of many blockchain applications will likely exert greater pressure on the network, due to the exponential increase of activities on the blockchain. If not handled properly, this might result in expensive transaction costs for application on the Ethereum blockchain, and unbearably long waiting time for a transaction to be processed. That said, there are several promising scaling projects currently in the pipeline, including Raiden Network, Plasma, Zilliqa, and Lightning Network. In light of these challenges, I would say that the technology aspect of blockchain is only in the ""early adopter"" stage, perhaps even in the ""innovator"" stage.A Growing Gap You can see the problem here. There is a gap between technology and investments. If we continue to grow the latter without supporting the development of the former, we might face a severe overvaluation of cryptocurrencies. Yes, the market has reached half a trillion dollars, but as Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, recently questioned, “Have we earned it?” More must be done to support the training of blockchain developers. Leading institutions such as National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University are some of the pioneers in this regards. And of course, greater resources should be directed towards advancing scaling solutions. Blockchain technology needs to catch up to blockchain investments. If the gap is too large for that to happen, perhaps we should dial down the fervor of our speculation.More on Forbes: Putting Singapore's Dollar On Blockchain May Prove It's The Most Crypto Friendly Place On Earth"

They also ordered all virtual currency exchanges to fully report on their risk management policies and operations immediately. Finance Minister Taro Aso commented publicly that the onsite inspections were conducted ""to ensure that the assets of Coincheck users are sufficiently protected.""A week ago, on January 26, Coincheck announced that they had been hacked and lost the equivalent of $534 million worth of the cryptocurrency, NEM. The Financial Services Agency issued Coincheck ""a business improvement order"" on January 29, and ordered a full report on the cause of the hacking and the firm's plan to pay back customers and prevent further losses by February 13. The onsite inspection today precedes that deadline. Japan's TBS News reported that starting around 8am, FSA inspectors carried out several boxes of computers, documents and other materials from the Coincheck offices. The FSA said the inspection was done to examine financial stability at Coincheck and the firm's ability to comply with the FSA's business improvement order.More on Forbes: Japan Cracks Down On Cryptocurrency Exchanges After $534M HeistThe FSA has approved 16 virtual currency exchanges to operate in Japan; Coincheck was not one of them. Last year the firm applied to become a registered exchange but the FSA did not give them approval, telling them there were flaws in their security system. At the Coincheck press conference on January 26, executives admitted that they had kept the stolen NEM in an internet connected ""hot wallet"" rather than a much more secure offline platform called a ""cold wallet."" The exchange also did not use a standard layer of security known as a multi-signature system.Public concernCoincheck announced last Sunday that they would pay back all the NEM users who lost funds, which they estimate will cost them the equivalent of $430 million. They have not specified a timeline or where they will find the funds. The firm has reportedly resumed some operations in other currencies. However, the general public is still concerned that the firm will not be able to make good on its promises.  A group of IT speciality lawyers yesterday launched ""The Countermeasures For The Victims Of Coincheck Legal Team (コインチェック被害者対策弁護団)."" On their website, they announced that they were preparing to sue Coincheck in the near future on behalf of NEM account holders who had suffered losses. The group states that, ""This hacking incident, makes us concerned that the future of virtual currency in Japan may be closed down.

The FSA raid, along with comments from Finance Minister Aso, appear to show that Japan is taking the matter very seriously.

So far, Japanese regulators have been taking a hands-off approach to both cryptocurrency trading and ICOs -- and while these two things are frequently grouped together, they are very different. Cryptocurrencies are already becoming and an important part of the economic landscape, but ICOs will prove to be a short-lived fad with most ICO tokens worthless. This is not a radical prediction. Blockchain technology does not change fundamental economics, and all tokens are not created equal. Tokens with intrinsic utility will increase in value, while those whose purpose is to extract value from a business will lose their value.  Almost all ICOs are of the later type. The two best known, and most valuable, tokens are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Both of these have novel, intrinsic utility.  Bitcoin enabled rapid, pseudo-anonymous transfer of value without a controlling middleman and Ethereum’s smart contracts enable simple payment agreements to be documented in and enforced by software not under the control of either party.More On Forbes: How Will ICO Bans Impact Cryptocurrencies?Both of these tokens represented significant advances to the state of the art and introduced utility that was not practical without them. Furthermore, this utility was enabled solely by the tokens themselves and not tied to the fortunes of any particular company or group of companies. Bitcoin’s ecosystem expanded as both illicit and legitimate transactions were attracted to the system. And while Ethereum’s smart contracts show a lot potential, demand and ecosystem growth have been primarily fueled by the fact that Ethereum enables ICOs.In both cases, since few practical alternatives exist, the price and demand for the tokens grew as their ecosystems grew.Most ICO startups, however, are not creating new utility, but grafting cryptocurrency onto an existing business model, and the value of these tokens are tied directly to the success of these firms.Business ranging from electricity retailing, to crowdfunding, to credit cards, to venture capital funds are using ICOs to raise funds. The CEOs I’ve spoken to seem to sincerely believe in their vision, and that their token holders will see substantial returns. But they are wrong.More On Forbes: ICOs: A Gold Mine Or Fool's Gold?The future value of these tokens comes not from enabling a new utility with few practical alternatives, but by siphoning cash from operations.ICO startups usually structure their business so that tokens must be purchased in order to do business with the startup. The theory being that the demand for tokens will expand as their business grows, and 1% to 5% of corporate cashflow will be diverted to token holders. With the founders usually holding between 20% and 30% of those tokens.Unlike Bitcoin and Etherium however, ICO startups are not creating new utility,  but entering existing markets with established competition, and they will be at a significant competitive disadvantage to firms that do not have to pay out 5% of their total sales.Competitive advantage or millstone?Although ICO startups often tout blockchain as a competitive advantage, these tokens will be a millstone around their necks once they begin operations. The more generous the token payments, the larger the operational handicap. Since the tokens themselves do not offer intrinsic utility, their value comes directly from operating margins. Even in those cases where the blockchain improves operational efficiency, ICO companies will be at a disadvantage to startups paying out less or nothing at all and will be driven out of business. Once that happens, the tokens will be worthless.  In reality, ICO tokens are similar to dividends and should be valued as such. However, valuing these tokens using something like discounted cash flow is a horrifying exercise. Valuations often imply billions of dollars in annual sales. That’s pretty ambitious for companies that, for the most part, do not have functional products or significant industry experience.Perhaps the most egregious use of ICOs are the firms using them to raise funds for venture investment. As is typical with most ICOs, the founders retain up to 30% of the tokens and tend to have little domain experience. While blockchain has the potential to both streamline dividend payments and helps shareholders assert their rights, that’s not what’s happening here. ICO investors are simply blinded by blockchain and paying a 30% load for a fund run by an unproven team.Terrible investmentsTechnical handwaving does not change economics, and most ICOs are simply terrible investments. But it’s even worse than that. Corporate equity and debt come with specific and enforceable legal rights. Tokens do not. While most whitepapers explain what the startup “plans” to do, the firm is under no legal obligation to follow those plans, and the pseudo-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies will probably make legal claims difficult to enforce in practice. The ultimate investor outrage, however, will occur when everything goes right. If against all odds, an ICO startup succeeds and begins generating the billions in sales required to make their tokens worth millions, nothing will prevent the firm from keeping those millions for itself. Unlike Bitcoin or Etherium, which have intrinsic utility, most ICO tokens are simply a mechanism the startup uses to transact business, and they are free to change that mechanism. There are few legal or technical hurdles that would prevent a startup, or more likely an acquiring company, from creating a new wholly-owned token, seamlessly migrating their customers to it, and leaving existing token-holders holding worthless tokens.In the long term, I think we will see thousands of successful, domain-specific cryptocurrencies, but the ones that win out will be those that provide the lowest-cost infrastructure, not those that promise the highest returns.There are clearly speculative profits to be made in buying tokens at or before ICO and selling them before the company begins operations and real-world economics take effect, but in the long run, the value of almost all of these tokens will be driven to zero.

futures bringing cryptocurrencies closer to traditional financial ...","Jan 7, 2018,03:32pm EST",Crypto,"2017 was a monumental year for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. The price of bitcoin rose almost 2000% from $1,000 in January to over $19,000 at its peak in December. Ether, Litecoin, Ripple and other leading cryptocurrencies experienced similar spikes and a host of new cryptocurrencies burst onto the scene. $3.7bn was raised via ICOs, calling into question the future of venture capital. And finally, CryptoKitties became a blockchain sensation as sales hit $12m in their first month.2018 is set to be another breakthrough year for cryptocurrencies. Here are my top 4 predictions:1. The cryptocurrency market will continue to grow as institutional capital gets involvedLast month CBOE and CME announced that they would start offering bitcoin futures bringing cryptocurrencies closer to traditional financial markets and adding legitimacy to a previously notorious asset class. Goldman Sachs was among one of the first institutions to announce that it would clear futures for its clients on a case by case basis and is set to launch a cryptocurrency trading desk by mid-2018.  Other institutions will undoubtedly follow suit as clients demand access to cryptocurrencies and as the infrastructure required to trade them at an institutional level is built out. This includes exchanges offering much-needed compliance and security tools as well as appropriate insurance products.In 2018, we will see the launch of numerous crypto funds. To date, there are over 100 (84 of which were launched in 2017) with an estimated $2bn in assets under management.  The proliferation of these funds will be coupled with the development of new crypto asset investment vehicles (futures, ETFs and mutual funds), which will broaden exposure to even the most conservative investors. For instance, one could envisage the development of a S&P 500 bitcoin-hedged ETF or network value weighted cryptocurrency ETFs including potentially a basket of the top 5,10 or 20 crypto assets.2. ICOs will professionalize as experienced investors move into the marketLast year was a bull year for ICOs. Unprecedented amounts of capital were raised with some projects such as Filecoin and Tezos raising over $200m in a single round of funding. Of the 230 ICOs in 2017, many took place off the back of nothing more than an idea (usually formulated in a white paper), a team of developers, and little to no due diligence.This year experienced investors will get involved with this new means of funding. They will demand further business validation and transparency, bringing the ICO process closer in line with traditional venture fundraising and making it increasingly difficult to raise off the back of a white paper. This trend will be supported by the development of ICO platforms such as CoinList, which carries out due diligence prior to accepting companies onto its platform, or Balanc3, which provides crypto companies with accounting and reporting tools.The professionalization of ICOs will be bolstered by the rise of SAFTs (Simple Agreement for Future Token Sales), investment contracts geared towards pre-product, pre-ICO fundraises and accessible to accredited investors only. In a SAFT sale, no coins are ever sold. Instead, money is exchanged for a traditional paper contract that promises access to a future product.SAFTs allow developers to build out a functioning network and tokens with real value prior to launching an ICO. Importantly, they also help token-based companies to comply with US securities regulation. As SAFTs become more commonplace we will see a decrease in the number of ICOs for pre-product, pre-network businesses and, as a result, the reduction in speculative token sales.3. Regulators will take a firm stance on ICOs leading to a short-term slowdownProfessionalization will go hand in hand with increased regulation globally. In 2017 we saw China and South Korea taking a stance and outright banning ICOs while the US ruled that certain crypto assets should be classified as securities and ICOs should be regulated accordingly.Over the course of the next year, other jurisdictions are likely to follow suit leading to a slowdown in ICOs in the short term. This, in turn, will result in an increase in “jurisdiction arbitrage” as crypto companies flock to countries such Switzerland and Luxembourg where cryptocurrency and ICO regulations are less stringent.Cryptocurrency trading will also come under further scrutiny. In 2018 the UK Treasury is set to regulate cryptocurrencies in line with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism rules forcing traders to reveal their identities in certain cases. Online platforms where cryptocurrencies are traded will be required to carry out due diligence on their customers and to report suspicious transactions. Jurisdictions around the world will most likely follow in their footsteps.In the short run, increased regulation may lead to a fall in prices and trading volumes. In the long run, it may help to legitimize the industry bringing it closer to the financial mainstream.4. Concerns around scalability and performance will lead to the rise of new platforms and approachesBoth Ethereum and Bitcoin, today’s leading platforms, face numerous issues which have led many to question their long-term potential. Worldwide bitcoin mining hardware now consumes roughly the same power as Denmark and some claim that by 2020 it will use more electricity than the entire world uses today.Bitcoin transactions times now range from 10 minutes up to several days and transaction fees have risen to over $4.75 per transaction, this will only get worse as more people join the network. Similarly to Bitcoin, Ethereum suffers from limited scalability. The crytokitties craze showed that a spike in just one app can be enough to cause bottlenecks in the entire network and a jump in transaction fees.As users become increasingly aware of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s shortcomings they will seek out alternatives leading to the rise of other currencies and platforms. Litecoin, Ripple, Monero and Zcash have already proven to be attractive alternatives to bitcoin. 2018 will see the launch of a host of new currencies such as Chia, a “better Bitcoin”. Founded by the inventor of BitTorrent, Chia is set to offer more reliable, eco-friendly mining and security measures. Likewise, Ethereum’s position as the leading smart contract platform will start to be challenged by newer platforms such as NEO and Cardano.In 2018 several solutions and upgrades to the problems above will be put forward. For instance, off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network (Bitcoin) and Raiden (Ethereum) will allow users to circumvent some of the high transaction costs and slow speeds of a transaction. An upgrade in Ethereum’s core protocol will also take place which will change the method for verifying transactions from proof-of-work to the faster and more cost-effective proof-of-stake.2017 brought cryptocurrencies into the limelight. As prices rose to eye-watering heights, speculators flocked to the market in droves, driving prices even higher. In 2018 new currencies and platforms will emerge, experienced investors and financial institutions will move into the market and regulators will take a stance. 2018 will be the year that cryptocurrencies become embedded in the traditional financial system."

Let’s start by telling our readers something about your background.Robert Arnott: I’ve been in investment management, specifically the quantitative investment arena, for 40 years. I’ve been involved in tactical asset allocation since the early 1980s, and quantitative equities since the late 1970s. I launched Research Affiliates in 2002.Forbes: Tell me about Research Affiliates.Arnott: We’re an unusual firm. We’re a $200 billion asset manager that manages no assets. Which sounds odd but our business model is very simple. We’re in the R&D business. We do research and develop investment management products and license them to other firms for distribution.Our licensees—our affiliates, as we call them—are our distribution platforms, and we are an extension of their R&D capabilities. This structure means we are held to a special standard, because everyone we work with has their own R&D capabilities. So, if we’re not doing work that is special, that is truly cutting edge, they don’t need us. Our affiliates include organizations like Pimco, Charles Schwab, Invesco PowerShares, Nomura in Japan, FTSE Russell, the global index provider, Colonial First State in Australia, Legal & General in the U.K., SSGA and BlackRock. Forbes: That’s an impressive list.Arnott: Yes, it is. We’re best known for our work in global tactical asset allocation and in pioneering the Fundamental Index strategy, and in so doing, opening the door for the whole array of smart beta strategies that are now out there. The term “smart beta” was coined in 2007 by Towers Watson, the consulting firm that was once based in the U.K.The genesis for the term was pretty straightforward: “Fundamental index” selects and weights companies based on the size of the company’s business, not based on its popularity, not based on its market capitalization, and hence not based on its price. With capitalization weighting, if the price doubles, the weight of a stock in the index doubles. Now why would you want to do that? Why would you want to have a bigger investment in a company just because it got more expensive? That makes no sense.In contrast, with the fundamental index, the weight changes only when the size of the company changes. That is, the weight doubles if the company’s size doubles—the company has grown. With the fundamental index, the size of the company’s business turns out to be a stable anchor for contra-trading against the market’s constantly changing expectations, speculations, fads, bubbles and crashes. The result is that when the market changes its mind about a company—that is, the market price changes—and that price change turns out to be an error that the market subsequently corrects, we will have sold high and then bought low, or vice versa. The result is an inherent buy low, sell high discipline that adds value.Forbes: So, you keep them all equal weight?Arnott: It’s not equal weight. It’s weighting companies by the size of their business. ExxonMobil and Apple are both big companies. They both get big weight. But ExxonMobil is a bigger company than Apple. So, while the market loves Apple, and doesn’t necessarily love ExxonMobil, Apple gets a bigger cap weight than ExxonMobil, because the market thinks Apple will be a bigger part of the world’s future economy than ExxonMobil. The fundamental index says, “Well, that might well be, but ExxonMobil is a bigger company so we’ll give ExxonMobil a bigger weight.”By doing that you add value not because our weight is the right weight--nobody knows what the right weight is—we  add value because of rebalancing and  contra-trading against the market’s constantly changing opinions. Towers Watson realized that our alpha engine had nothing to do with the fundamentals; our alpha came from rebalancing. They asked what else does this? The answer was an array of strategies, including equal weighting and minimum variance. So, they coined the expression “smart beta” to encompass all of these strategiesThe term “smart beta” caught on to an extent where everybody wants to say, “we do smart beta.” The term has morphed to mean just about anything. And, of course, if it means anything it means nothing. So that’s where we are now, “smart beta” means nothing. Unless you define it narrowly the way it was originally defined when it referred to strategies that win because they rebalance or contra-trade against the irrationality that happens in the market.We are also known for our work in global tactical asset allocation. A common thread here is that they are both contrarian strategies. They both involve buying what is out of favor and unloved, and selling what is beloved and popular. One of our core beliefs is that if you want to buy low and sell high, anything that is newly expensive is likely to have got there by creating great joy and profit. It’s hard for people to sell what’s given them great joy and profit.It’s even harder on the other side. Anything that’s a new bargain is likely to have inflicted pain and losses. It’s hard to step forward and say, “I want more of that,” for an asset that’s inflicted pain and losses. So that’s the challenge with contrarian investing. It works, but it works because it’s painful, because it’s uncomfortable, and because the markets don’t reward comfort. We have a whole array of strategies that are tied into this work. We have fundamental low volatility strategies that look for low volatility and then fundamentally weight them. We have multi-factor strategies that look for stocks that are highly representative of particular factors such as value, quality, momentum, low volatility, small companies, and then fundamentally weight each of these sleeves. We have global tactical asset allocation that we do almost exclusively through Pimco. The minor exception is a global macro strategy that we manage using long short futures around the world.These strategies share a common denominator of a contrarian nature, of a deliberate conscious and structural effort to buy low and sell high. Now, of course, that doesn’t always work. It won’t work when markets are in a trending environment, such as when momentum is working brilliantly and when growth is wildly popular. Years like 2017 are challenging for us. But, like a coiled spring, when you have these years, I can’t wait for the snap back. Because the snap back is usually remarkable.Forbes: Do you have any particular observations at the moment about where we are now or looking forward? Are some asset classes undervalued and attractive?Arnott: Sure.  I would give some on both ends of the spectrum. I’m not one to use the word bubble lightly. But there are some bubbles at work in the marketplace today. Bitcoin, something with no inherent value, going from six cents in 2011 to more than $16,000 recently—phenomenal. Is it tulips, or is it a new form of non-government issued currency? Well, that’s in the eye of the beholder. The best sense for Bitcoin having merit is that fiat currencies like the dollar also have no inherent value. They’re faith-based too.But really, it’s hard to see anything in Bitcoin that has more merit than tulips. So, I look on that as very bubbly. The ICE exchange—launching the FANG-plus futures contract. My goodness, they didn’t even do that at the peak of the tech bubble. Look at the ten largest market-capitalization companies in the world. The top of the list are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba and Tencent—that’s seven in a row! The top seven, all tech names! How often in history have we seen the top seven market-cap companies in the world all representing a single sector? Never. It’s never happened before, not once.Forbes: So, what are you doing with those companies?Arnott: I’d steer clear. They’re popular, they’re beloved and they’re dangerous. That said, a couple of them are real companies—notably, Apple and Microsoft—with real P&L and valuation multiples that are not outrageous, but I’d be very wary. Even at the top of the tech bubble, only four of the top seven were tech names. And here’s the most interesting nuance about the top ten. If you go back to 1980, there were only two stocks that were still on the top ten list in 1990. If you go back to 1990, there were only two that were still there in 2000. If you go back to 2000, there were only two that were still there in 2010. If you go back to 2010, there were only three that were still there by the start of this year. So, the rotation out of the top ten list is astoundingly fast. How many of those top seven are still going to be on the top ten list in ten years?Forbes: Your thoughts?Arnott: I think there will be two.Forbes: Are you using any of those stocks now?Arnott: It depends on their size and the strategy. I would say we’re underweight all of them, and we have zero exposure to most of them. Where I see opportunity is in some other anomalies. The U.S. is at a Shiller P/E ratio, price relative to ten-year smoothed earnings, of 32. Thirty-two times the ten-year smoothed earnings. Now Wall Street will say, “Forget about ten-year smoothed earnings, earnings are heading to the moon.” Okay, well if you believe that, great. I can sell you a piece of paper that says you own the Brooklyn Bridge. But if you believe history is a good guide, peak earnings tend to mean-revert downward. So, you have to worry about that possibility. And they certainly don’t loft to new highs relative to GDP.If we’re looking at prices that are 32 times the ten-year average earnings, that’s expensive. Emerging market stocks are at 14 times. Less than half the multiple of the U.S. So that’s a very interesting market. Europe is at 16 times. It’s half off relative to the U.S. There are those who say, “Well, U.S. has very low interest rates, so of course valuation multiples are high.” Fine. Europe has zero interest rates, so why are their valuations half ours, if their interest rates are even lower than those of the U.S? Look at value in emerging markets. In the U.S., value is trading about 25% cheap relative to the market. In emerging markets, it’s close to 40% cheap.Forbes: So, emerging markets are an area of attraction at this point?Arnott: Correct. And when we look at the fundamental index in emerging markets, you can buy half the world’s GDP, fundamentally weighted instead of cap-weighted, for about nine times earnings. That’s pretty cool. If you can buy half the world’s GDP for nine times earnings or buy the U.S. for 32 times earnings, I know where I’m going to put my money.Forbes: Any final points you’d like to make?Arnott: Sure. On the bond side, there are equally strange anomalies. European junk bonds yield less than 2% and less than U.S. ten-year Treasury yields. That’s bizarre. Junk bonds in Europe yielding less than 2%, what are these people thinking? Meanwhile emerging markets hard currency sovereign debt, much of which is investment grade, yields more than U.S. junk bonds. So, on the bond side, again, emerging markets looks to be where the bargains are the found.Today, I look around globally and I see emerging markets debt, and fundamentally weighted stocks in emerging markets as the low-hanging fruit. Now that’s low-hanging in relative terms, not absolute terms.They aren’t bargains. Nothing’s a bargain. But they’re sensibly priced. And they’re priced to give us pretty darn good rates of return. Mainstream U.S. stocks and bonds, you’ll be lucky to earn zero net of inflation.Forbes: I want to thank you very much for taking the time to join us, Rob.Arnott: Thank you for inviting me to do so, Wally."

Today there are hundreds (thousands?) of mystery box subscriptions or one-off purchases for just about everything from Star Wars to dog toys to Japanese snacks and beauty products. Now, a startup called CBlocks wants to be your next favorite mystery box -- for Cryptocurrency.","Various Crypto CoinsThe premise of CBlocks is straightforward. You give the company a specified amount of cash -- there are 4 subscriptions tiers that range from $75 to $500 -- and they load up a physical USB wallet with 5 randomly selected alt coins such as Litecoin, Monero, Dogecoin, etc. Then it's shipped inside a collector's case. For example, if you purchase the $75 box, they'll load up the USB wallet with $50 worth of random cryptocurrencies. Each tier costs $25 more than the provided value of alt coins, most likely to compensate for various operating costs like shipping and the hardware itself.As for the random nature of the selections, the company says they utilize a proprietary algorithm to choose among the currently available coins. Thus, there's zero guarantee (nor an implied promise) that they're choosing the most profitable alt coins at the time. But hey, investing in cryptocurrency is this weirdly thrilling mixture of playing the stock market and gambling, so it's bound to be appealing to a large enough demographic to allow the service to continue humming along.Interestingly, I'm posting this article on a day when Bitcoin has crashed below $10,000 and seen $36 billion of its market value wiped, so the inherent risk in buying these packages from CBlocks is readily apparent. On the other hand, I can't help but point out that when I stopped mining cryptocurrency in 2013, I owned 2 Bitcoins. Had I held onto them instead of cashing out, I'd have effortlessly banked about $18,000 in profit despite Bitcoin's plummeting trend this month.For the true believers in alt coins, CBlocks may be onto something. Unless the crypto bubble bursts completely, which has been prophesied literally every single day since 2009."

With the IRS and SEC starting to turn attention to the cryptocurrency industry, it is important to have accurate facts. The following are some of the more popular questions I have received from clients seeking clarity on various tax and regulatory matters regarding the taxation and regulation of cryptocurrencies.","Cryptocurrency is treated as a currency for tax purposes: False.According to IRS Notice 2014-21, for federal tax purposes, cryptocurrency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. The character of the gain or loss associated with the cryptocurrency investment generally depends on whether the cryptocurrency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of cryptocurrency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer. For example, stocks, real estate, and other investment property are typically capital assets. Whereas, a taxpayer generally realizes ordinary gain or loss on the sale or exchange of cryptocurrency that is not a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer, such as business income from mining or other business activities.The IRS will never be able to find out if I had taxable gains from cryptocurrency investments. False.First, a taxpayer failing to maintain adequate records faces serious consequences. The IRS can impose penalties for negligence or fraud or require the taxpayer to use an IRS-prescribed method to determine income.The IRS has been watching the cryptocurrency industry with some suspicion for years. Because the majority of cryptocurrency transactions have likely resulted in significant gains due to the surge in value of most cryptocurrencies in 2017 coupled with the fact that the gains are likely short-term capital gains (subject to ordinary income tax rates), the IRS has good reason to be concerned.As a result, in a petition filed November 17, 2016, with the US District Court for the Northern District of California, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the court for a John Doe summons to be issued to the Bitcoin exchange Coinbase Inc. The John Doe summons would require Coinbase Inc., the largest Bitcoin exchanger in the United States, to provide the DOJ with information related to all Bitcoin transactions it processed between 2013 and 2015. The DOJ would then share the information received with the IRS to be matched against filed tax returns. In addition, there is a good chance the IRS will be targeting other cryptocurrency exchanges through their John Doe summons power to gather additional taxpayer information on cryptocurrency transactions.Therefore, it is crucial that any taxpayer that has generated any net gains or losses from cryptocurrencies investments in 2017 be prepared to report them on his or her individual income tax return. It is a good idea to work with a tax professional who can help calculate the aggregate annual net short-term or net long-term capital gains or losses generated from all 2017 cryptocurrency investments.The SEC is not currently regulating the cryptocurrency industry? True & FalseIn a statement by the Securities & Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Chairman Jay Clayton on cryptocurrencies on December 11, 2017, Mr. Clayton was clear that the SEC has “interests and responsibilities” with respect to cryptocurrencies. Mr. Clayton did express caution for investors looking to make initial coin offering (“ICO”) investments. In addition, Mr. Clayton was clear that if an ICO shared the same characteristics of a security then it must be subject to securities laws.In July 2017, the SEC ruled that some of the ‘coins’ for sale in an ICO are actually securities—and are subject to SEC regulation. In its ruling in the DAO case, which involved DAO, an unincorporated organization; Slock.it UG (“Slock.it”), a German corporation, the SEC essentially held that the tokens for sale are simply a new form of shares—and that selling them without a license could violate federal securities laws. The SEC ruling was based on an SEC investigation into a German corporation behind a group called the DAO, which raised $150 million in ICO last year. In addition, in December 2017, the SEC announced that its newly created Cyber Unit has filed a complaint against a Canadian initial coin offering (ICO) fraud. Moreover, state regulatory agencies are also starting to look at cryptocurrency transactions. On January 9, 2018, regulators from the North Carolina Securities Division outlined the temporary cease-and-desist, stating that BitConnect, who was seeking to do an ICO, had not registered to deal or sell securities in North Carolina.In sum, the SEC has not gone on record holding that cryptocurrencies are securities and are, thus, subject to securities law, however, they have taken the lead in prosecuting various cryptocurrency related cases and it does appear that they are potentially heading in that direction. In any event, anyone looking to raise money through an ICO should be mindful of the SEC securities laws.Cryptocurrencies are subject to Foreign Bank Account Reporting (“FBAR”) Rules? FalseWith cryptocurrency investments, taxpayers may find it more difficult to determine whether they own other financial accounts for FBAR reporting purposes. The regulations clarify that bonds, notes, and stocks of foreign issuers directly held by a reporting person aren't financial accounts. Other financial arrangements aren't so clear. For example, the IRS maintains that accounts that hold noncash assets, such as gold, are subject to FBAR reporting. However, the IRS has informally stated that taxpayers aren't required to report cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, on an FBAR. The thinking is that cryptocurrency is treated as property for federal income tax purposes and therefore isn't considered to be an interest in a foreign financial account. However, this could change as the agency's attention on foreign assets heightens.Cryptocurrencies can be purchased with retirement funds? TrueThe Internal Revenue Code does not describe what a retirement account can invest in, only what it cannot invest in. Internal Revenue Code Sections 408 & 4975 prohibit “disqualified persons” from engaging in certain types of transactions, such as collectibles, life insurance, and self-dealing and conflict of interest type transactions. The definition of a “disqualified person” (Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(e)(2)) extends into a variety of related party scenarios, but generally includes the retirement account holder, any ancestors or lineal descendants of the 401(k) plan participant, and entities in which the 401(k) plan participant holds a controlling equity or management interest.Because the IRS treats cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoins, as a capital asset, such as stocks or real estate, a retirement account is permitted to buy, sell, or hold cryptocurrencies, subject to the prohibited transaction rules found under Internal Revenue Code Section 4975(c).Cryptocurrencies gains can be sheltered though the 1031 Like-Kind Exchange Rules? MaybeIn general, Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 1031 provides an exception to the recognition of gain on a business or investment property transaction and allows one to postpone paying tax on the gain if the individual reinvests the proceeds in similar property as part of a qualifying like-kind exchange. Gain deferred in a like-kind exchange under IRC Section 1031 is tax-deferred, but it is not tax-free. However, IRC Section 1031 specifically excludes stocks, bonds, notes, and other securities or debt from the definition of property under the IRC 1031 exchange exemption. In IRS Revenue Ruling 79-143, the IRS did suggest that gold coins held for investment of the same nature or character can benefit from IRC Section 1031 gain exemption.IRC Section 1031 does not mention “cryptocurrency” since Section 1031 preceded the arrival of cryptocurrencies and IRS Notice 2014-21 does not reference IRC Section 1031 like-kind exchanges. Moreover, under the Trump tax plan, beginning in 2018, IRC Section 1031 exchanges are now only limited to real property. Therefore, for 2018 and beyond, the like-kind exchange exemption will not be applicable to cryptocurrency investors. But will the like-kind exchange exemption apply to cryptocurrencies for the 2017 taxable year? Some suggest that the fact that the tax plan narrowed the definition of property for purposes of IRC Section 1031, is proof that there was concern about the use of like-kind exchanges for cryptocurrency investments. However, there does not appear to be any evidence of this.Overall, there is an argument that IRC Section 1031 exchange rules could apply to cryptocurrencies for 2017 so long as the crypto was held for investment purposes and was exchanged for “like-kind property.” For example, a Bitcoin held for investment purposes exchanged for ethereum could be considered a property of the same nature and character. Whereas, cryptocurrencies have not yet been defined as a stock or security or other type of property exempted from the like-kind exchange rules. Nevertheless, satisfying all the IRC Section 1031 rules could prove difficult for some cryptocurrency investors. Accordingly, taking the position that cryptocurrency gains can be sheltered using IRC Section 1031 exchange is risky and may not be respected by the IRS.The wash rule for stocks likely do not apply to cryptocurrencies? TrueUnder IRC Section 1091, the IRS prohibits a taxpayer from claiming a loss on the sale or trade of a security in a wash sale. The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a “substantially identical” stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so. Currently, cryptocurrencies are treated as property by the IRS and have not been treated as a stock or security by any government agency. Accordingly, the wash sales rules are believed to not be applicable to cryptocurrencies.The Trump Tax Plan Passthrough Tax Reduction Can Help Cryptocurrency Investors? True & FalseUnder the Trump tax plan, passthrough entities, such as limited liability companies (“LLC”s), would receive a deduction allowing people with pass-through income — profits from a partnership or sole proprietorship, for instance — to write off 20% of that income before calculating their taxes. Hence, cryptocurrency active traders who wish to treat themselves as a business, could avail themselves of the passthrough income deduction. However, the new passthrough income tax regime will still likely result in a higher tax rate than holding cryptocurrencies for investment or personal purposes, especially if the cryptos are being held for longer than twelve months, thus, being subject to the long-term capital gains regime.Overall, cryptocurrency is an asset class that is still evolving. The IRS has provided some clarification as to its tax treatment under Notice 2014-21, however, some uncertainty still remains. In addition, the lack of direct guidance by the SEC and state regulatory bodies have only added more confusion.Taxpayers should be diligent and precise when reporting cryptocurrency gains or losses to the IRS and should be cautious when taking aggressive tax positions, such as the application of like-kind exchange exemption rules. Taxpayers would be best served consulting with a tax professional for more direct guidance on these matters."

Until they are more easily understood, B2B interests cannot take advantage of the potential profits. But that won’t be the case for very long.Blockchain is a sophisticated algorithm created for cryptocurrency. It drives a distributed data structure that manages electronic cash movements. It replaces the administrative role of a central bank or government backing.The blockchain is the repository and distributor of virtual coins. Crypto-coins are not carried or handled, but they do trade, multiply and function thanks to the blockchain at the center. If you picture a business ledger that updates itself in real-time, multiplying that picture by billions of data spaces will give you some illustration of the way blockchain works. For B2B companies, it can be a virtual bank—moving money, accepting deposits, completing transactions and more. This differs from online banking where your business is subject to regulation, monitoring, business hours and other restrictions.How Does Blockchain Technology Help B2B companies?Blockchain is Picking Up VelocityThis technology may have the public confused. Most people had never heard of it until Bitcoin started to catch everyone’s attention. Virtual coinage and cryptocurrency are a long way from being ubiquitous terms, but that is changing fast. Epstein notes, “We are living in the ‘age of accelerations,’ as Tom Friedman calls it. In fact, there are studies out now that say millennials would prefer to hold cryptocurrencies over stocks. Granted, some of that is due to the crypto-mania currently taking place, but it is noteworthy.”A closer look at blockchain and distributed ledger technology reveals the deep impression it has made on major banks, Big Data, social media platforms, browser powerhouses and eCommerce leaders. IBM is already using blockchain in its television commercials for business cloud services.The next generation of providers and consumers will know the tools and language well. The transactions will be second nature to them, and anything not blockchain will seem archaic, risky and foolishly expensive. The reality is, most people will not even know they are using a blockchain back-end, but just like WiFi, fast internet, and phones today, in the near future the expectation will be intermediary-free transactions.The cryptocurrency platforms have invited people to come to them. Other than the sophisticated code, they have no product to offer. Conversely, a credit card provides the illusion of cash that is on hand and available. Thanks to some governmental oversight, we have credit card statements that we almost understand. The public has adapted to this, psychologically.Likewise, the business owner has become used to established routines and GAAP oversight. This significant shift in ledger processing will come with a learning curve, and although the new systems would immediately benefit eCommerce, it will require a revolution in how online marketing and sales occur. We can anticipate a time when blockchain will ensure even greater security, more practical applications and customized products. When customers find it cost effective and easy to navigate, the market will follow.“There’s a saying in the blockchain world,” says Epstein who works with blue-chip crypto projects like OpenBazaar and Zcash. “Five months in crypto is like five years in the regular world in terms of change. My advice is that it’s better to spend the time now to get prepared than to get caught blind-sided.” How long this transition will take is anyone’s guess, but it’s gaining momentum. Increased trust, security and efficiency will always help B2B companies compete. Blockchain can build all three."

The opinion by the Finance Ministry rightly reflects the position expressed last year by Central Bank president Elvira Nabiullina.The draft bill mentions cryptocurrency and tokens, another form of digital money used as payment for a start-up company's services.

FEDERICO PARRA/AFP/Getty ImagesHowever, the fact that Maduro sees the need to back his cryptocurrency with hard assets should immediately give potential investors pause for thought. Real cryptocurrencies rely on network effects for their value. People use them because they trust them. Yes, they are supposed to be trust-free, but as I have pointed out before, cryptocurrency users do trust the technology, even if they don’t trust each other. Backing a cryptocurrency with hard assets is hardly a ringing endorsement of either the issuer or the technology.There’s a second problem, too. Both the country and its state-owned oil company PDVSA defaulted on their U.S. dollar debt in November 2017: the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) declared the default a “credit event,” triggering payment of credit default swaps. Clearly, Venezuela is not producing enough oil to meet its existing U.S. dollar obligations. Why would anyone buy claims to an additional $5.9 billion worth of Venezuelan oil?Of course, as the new cryptocurrency confers not a claim on Venezuela’s oil production, but a claim on oil still in the ground, in theory the new cryptocurrency owners could call in their claims and drill for oil themselves. But Venezuela’s record on allowing outsiders to drill for oil on its territory is abysmal. What value does oil still in the ground really have, if the only way of extracting it is through a joint venture with the appallingly mismanaged and possibly bankrupt PDVSA?And how much of this oil is really available to back a new currency, anyway? Much of Venezuela’s oil is already pledged, particularly to China, in return for previous loans. Venezuela has form for pledging assets that are already encumbered by existing claims. How do we know this isn’t more of the same?Despite all these reservations, it seems that Venezuelans, at any rate, are interested in the new cryptocurrency. Online cryptocurrency magazines report that over 860,000 Venezuelans have registered with Venezuela’s new Registry of Cryptocurrency Miners, which is the only portal through which the petro can be mined. Yes, you read that right - in Venezuela, government licenses its cryptocurrency miners, just as it licenses its banks. Furthermore, the operation of the new currency will be supervised by the Superintendency of Cryptocurrencies and Related Assets.  Government controls mining, government supervises operations, government sets the price … the petro is looking less and less like a real cryptocurrency, isn’t it?In fact, why are we calling this a cryptocurrency at all? Really, it’s a digital oil-backed security. Recording transactions on a blockchain and adding some cryptography doesn’t make it a cryptocurrency. It isn’t decentralized, it isn’t anonymous, and it isn’t going to be used to buy and sell goods and services in Venezuela, although there are suggestions that it could be used to pay international suppliers. And above all, its value depends on the trustworthiness of a government already in default on its international obligations. Trustless, it isn’t.So why is Maduro calling this a cryptocurrency? On the face of it, this is about the country’s dire financial situation. Although Russia and China seem to have agreed to a restructuring of Venezuela’s debt, issuing more bonds is probably a non-starter. So Maduro has hit on a clever wheeze to ease Venezuela’s crippling FX shortage and stave off further defaults. Wealthy Venezuelans (yes, they do exist) have been using Bitcoin to protect their wealth from hyperinflation.  Venezuelans who mine Bitcoin can sell their bitcoins for dollars, bypassing the government, while Venezuelans who want to get their money out of Venezuela can buy bitcoins. Forcing Bitcoin miners to register with the government doesn't necessarily help the government to get its hands on their dollars. Why not encourage them to use a government cryptocurrency instead?But although reducing capital flight might help the government stave off dollar bankruptcy, it won’t end the hyperinflation that is now causing starvation among Venezuela’s population. Only those who can mine the currency, or have US dollars to sell on the “virtual exchanges” where the issue will be placed, can obtain it. And because this is a government issue, the dollars will go to the government, not to the people. So not only will there be no digital currency for ordinary Venezuelans, there won’t be more dollars either. It’s hard not to see this as an opportunity missed: introducing a new domestic currency backed by hard assets, or dollarizing, can be a good way of ending hyperinflation. But it seems Maduro is more interested in getting his hands on sufficient U.S. dollars to pay his Chinese and Russian paymasters than easing the humanitarian crisis in his country.However, Maduro has stated that the new cryptocurrency is not just a way of easing Venezuela’s financial crisis. It is also about bypassing U.S. sanctions. And it is telling that Maduro is doing this now, when Russia is reportedly considering something very similar, also as a means of evading U.S. sanctions. Maduro has made no secret of the fact that he would like to break the U.S. dollar’s dominance in the oil market. Putin would no doubt like to do so too, and Russia and Venezuela have strong ties. Could this be a coordinated attack on the dollar by two of the world’s largest oil and gas producers?Full disclosure: I don't own any cryptocurrencies and have no plans to do so, Venezuelan or otherwise."

But one major stands out today, and that's Ripple (XRP). The token tied to the digital payments startup is back trading over $2 thanks to an announced deal with Dallas-based MoneyGram. MoneyGram shares rose over 6% on the news.MoneyGram will allow their customers to send and complete cross-border payments with the XRP token instead of fiat currencies like the dollar. MoneyGram will use the company's xRapid, Ripple’s on-demand liquidity product, Ripple said today.  The system permits real-time foreign exchange settlement through ripple coin, ""which gives financial institutions the ability to unlock liquidity and access multiple corridors with one pre-funded originating account.""Ripple has been rising from a small, relatively unknown cryptocurrency to a top-three behind heavyweights bitcoin and ether. Major venture capital firms and banks have invested in the company, including Google Ventures and Standard Chartered bank.This week, word that the South Korean government would ban trading sent ripples through the crypto market. South Korea, Japan and China account for the lion's share of trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. Demand for cryptocurrency has grown so fast, top exchanges like Bitstamp and Okex are closed to new accounts.  The Korean government still seems noncommittal to the idea of the outright ban of exchanges, something China did late last year. Cryptocurrencies fever is rampant in South Korea. Demand tends to push prices of many tokens nearly 30%  higher than they are on exchanges in other countries, leading to arbitrage purchases by risk-taking locals.The country’s Justice Minister Park Sang-ki said the decision to curb trading is multi-departmental, including members of the Finance Ministry and securities regulators. “There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges,” Sang-Ki was quoted saying in Reuters.Asia headlines have been a mixed blessing for MoneyGram.

(Photographer: Qilai Shen/Bloomberg)The company's attempt to sell to China's Ant Financial, a unit of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant founded by billionaire Jack Ma, was banned just last week by the U.S. government.  MoneyGram said it was unable to obtain the required approval for the transaction from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.""The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,” MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a statement. “Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that CFIUS will not approve this merger. We are disappointed in the termination of this compelling transaction,” he said.MoneyGram is a popular service in emerging markets like China and Brazil, where expats often use it to repatriate cash to family members back home or to pay bills. They can now do so in XRP.This week, two Goldman Sachs economists issued a report titled ""Bitcoin as Money"" arguing that cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, were more apt to be used as a source of payment in weak currency nations where dollars are scarce.Ripple rose to fame after it announced a pilot program signed between two South Korean banks and a consortium of 61 Japanese banks. It's been on a tear ever since. South Korea pulled a rug out from under it this week, but the MoneyGram news kept it from falling further.That might not hold.Seoul is preparing a bill which will ban all cryptocurrencies from trading on local exchanges. It is unclear how this would impact Ripple's pilot project. The company was unavailable for immediate comment.""Banning cryptocurrencies altogether would be difficult given that the country is one of the biggest markets in the world, especially for bitcoin and ethereum,"" says Forbes contributor Naeem Aslam, chief market strategist for ThinkMarkets in London. ""Keep in mind that this is not the first time that the regulators have gone after the cryptocurrency market.  During this week alone, we have seen two headlines emerging from South Korea aimed at bitcoin. There is no doubt that the demand for bitcoin in South Korea is massive and some elements of the public's behavior — when it comes to trading the cryptocurrencies — aren’t far from gambling habits.""Traders should not read too much into the South Korean situation, Aslam wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Once the bill is drafted, it would require a backing of 297 members of the National Assembly, a process which could take months or even years.""Ripple's growth over the past year has been stellar and it has acquired multiple institutional customers who are seriously considering using it for cross-border settlements,"" says Abhishek Pitti, founder of Nucleus.Vision, a visual data company using blockchain technology based in Palo Alto and Hyderabad, India. Mumbai-based Reliance Capital serves as both an advisor and early investor to the company. Draper Ventures founder Tim Draper is also a lead investor in Pitti's company. ""Ripple has shown that they can facilitate double-digit million dollars worth of transactions in seconds, at a fraction of the cost of a bitcoin transaction,"" he says.Pitti thinks XRP will escape South Korea's crypto ban.""I don't think South Korea is banning cryptocurrencies altogether,"" he says. ""They are clamping down on unregulated exchanges so that shouldn't effect ripple because their primary users are regulated financial institutions."""

Just last week, finance luminaries Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon contradicted each other, with Dimon saying he regretted calling Bitcoin a fraud and Buffet warning that cryptocurrencies would end badly.[Disclosure: The author invests in several cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum and IOTA and consults on ICO launches. Investing in any cryptocurrency is very risky --you can lose your entire investment.]For the most part, everyone I talk to (who is not an engineer) doesn’t really get what blockchain is and how it can actually be used (besides as a currency). To those of you who are unaware that there is any other purpose for blockchain, it is important to note that while the press has focused on the 1300% increase in Bitcoin’s value, most of the actual work being done is in creating applications for blockchain that have little to do with currency -- or at least currency is only a component of the applications’ larger purpose. Ethereum, for example, is the platform on which several new applications are being developed, from universally-accessible (but private) medical records to distributed cloud storage (think Airbnb for extra hard-drive space) to licensing royalty management apps. What these future applications have in common is that humans have been removed as the middlemen who are too costly or inefficient to allow these applications to currently exist. With blockchain technology, the machines transact among themselves, so a patient’s full health history is recorded automatically, you can earn money storing a stranger’s stuff on unused hard drives and you don’t need an agent to protect your photo copyrights.All of this sounds great, of course, but what does any of it have to do with marketing? You may have heard this, but the Internet of Things is coming. Quickly. Gartner predicts that by 2020, we’ll have over 20 billion smart devices, many with sensors, cameras and microphones connected to the internet. These are items like smart thermostats, smart TVs, baby monitors and security cameras that alert you when movement is detected, as well as any product you can control with an app.Right now they’re collecting data, but that data isn’t captured anywhere that can help you understand the person using these devices. But what if all of the behavioral usage data from each of those independent smart objects was captured into a user and household profile? And what if those profiles were connected to a machine-learning AI that could deliver nuanced profiles based on real-world data (rather than 12-person focus groups or surveys of people who may not actually use your product)? You’d know that the 42-year-old guy in 94904 uses the treadmill his wife bought him for Christmas only once a month. You’d also know his favorite beer (always stocked by his smart fridge), that he has a child under two (baby monitor), is a fan of ""Stranger Things,"" commutes 20 minutes to work each day and regularly reorders hemorrhoid pads on Amazon. Amazing for marketers. Creepy for citizens.With this insight, you'd create much more targeted campaigns, form promotional partnerships you'd never have considered and increase the overall ROI of every marketing dollar spent. To be clear, this is coming one way or another -- which means a lot of the art of marketing will be supplanted by the science of AI targeting. If you've used Facebook’s Custom Audiences you've seen a glimpse of how powerful this can be.So how will we get this data? It’s no accident that Amazon, Google and Apple are locked in an arms race to get their home hubs into as many homes as possible. If their hub is the one used to control all your connected devices, they become the data monopoly that all marketing revenue will flow to in five years. But not if a German nonprofit developing a cryptocurrency called IOTA can get there first. IOTA’s proponents describe it as “post-blockchain” technology and it is technologically different from blockchain but based on its same principles. It wants to be the future method of information exchange between smart products and is developing something called the data warehouse. Don’t go nuts and invest your 401k here just yet -- it’s still early and the technology is not proven -- but it’s promising enough to have attracted some big-name collaborators. In this concept, data from all of the smart devices in your life would flow through a sort of data bazaar where bits and pieces of it could be purchased by people who want it -- like marketers. In this scheme, the user controls access to personally identifiable data and gets paid if they choose to sell it. Your home hub would still collect data but would no longer have a monopoly. And because the system might create the ability for individual smart devices to interact with each other without going through a central hub or the cloud for instructions, not all usage data might be shared with the home hub.Aside from the hurdles of engineering this new technology, implementation would require broad adoption across manufacturers of smart devices and security will be a key development and PR challenge (these devices can take video from inside your home!). In the U.S., the market influence of big tech will likely slow implementation, but Europe just passed legislation giving consumers ownership of their personal data so it is more likely to take root there first.As marketers, either way we’ll waste less money trying to identify who we’re targeting and testing ads with the wrong customers. And we’ll be able to create promotional offers that have real value to customers because they'll be tailored in a way that’s currently not possible. Marketing and product development will continue to meld together as both share the same goal of anticipating and serving the needs of well-defined users. As a citizen, though, I’m hoping the consumer-as-data-owner blockchain model wins out."

(Xinhua/Xu Jinquan via Getty Images)","Under the decidedly grim moniker ""creating a shared future in a fractured world,"" the world’s elite gathered in Davos, Switzerland for the annual meetings of the World Economic Forum. Awaiting the arrival of President Donald Trump, delegates were regaled with prognostications about the state of the global economy and whether national retrenchment would signal the end of multilateralism as we know it. While Trump’s remarks on the closing day of the Forum signaled that America first does not necessarily mean America alone, there was one sub-theme that echoed throughout the snow-covered mountains of Davos – Blockchain, Blockchain, Blockchain.Blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins Bitcoin’s rise to prominence (along with nearly 1,500 cryptocurrencies), is slated to transform the world, or so its adherents proclaim. While Blockchain and digital assets were widely featured on the main stage at Davos, perhaps the most insightful conversations were taking place in standing room only events hosted by groups like the Global Blockchain Business Council, whose CEO, Jamie Smith, and chairman, Tomicah Tillemann, have emerged as global emissaries helping Blockchain go mainstream. Indeed, Jamie Smith has made it her personal mission to be the explainer-in-chief of this powerful technology so that more of the world can grasp its potential.A lofty agenda dominated these Blockchain discussions, which turned from emerging regulatory frameworks, such as Gibraltar’s move to become the bona fide marketplace of choice for initial coin offerings (ICOs). To the EU Parliament’s staunchest digital transformation advocate, Eva Kaili, who is working diligently to craft sensible legislation that does not stymie innovation, but encourages it. It is increasingly clear that digital assets and the distributed ledger technology that underpins them are not going away. Based on these market trends, Blockchain-based solutions may be entering a period of accelerated deployment across a wide variety of grinding problems, from financial inclusion to rural electrification among others. Indeed, the famed Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto has taken to The Wall Street Journal heralding Blockchain’s potential to eradicate poverty in a recent piece co-authored with Phil Gramm.Turning to Blockchain opportunities in frontier and emerging markets, entrepreneurs such as Paula Guedes and her startup, Jobzi, is shedding new light on Brazil’s job market and leveling the career playing field using Blockchain. Elizabeth Rosiello is revolutionizing the pan-African payments market with BitPesa, while serial entrepreneur Gabriel Abed, the founder of Bitt, is emerging as a veritable crypto-statesman through his work with Caribbean central banks. The war against opacity, friction and institutional mistrust, which is at an all-time low around the world, not only has some staunch adversaries in these entrepreneurs, they are armed with a powerful new tool in Blockchain. Just as emerging and frontier economies are leap frogging brick and mortar banking and fixed-line telephony, many of these countries will be the proving grounds for entirely new forms of trust-based governance and decentralized economic structures. Estonia’s former Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas shared as much during his address highlighting how Estonia made it to the top of the leaderboard for national digital transformation.Laurent Lamothe, the former Prime Minister of Haiti who presided over not one but two national catastrophes with the massive earthquake, which effectively leveled his country, to the cholera outbreak caused by UN peacekeepers, underscored how Blockchain can enhance government continuity and resilience. Indeed, the decentralized, off-premises nature of Blockchain registries makes the technology resilient by design and an ideal “seed vault” for critical information, such as land titles. Public sector leaders like Prime Minister Lamothe, Albert Isola, Gibraltar’s Minister for Commerce and Nick Cowan, CEO of the newly launched Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) were quick to advise that Blockchain-based solutions cannot live in a leadership vacuum. They, like other delegates, urged leadership for the full potential of this foundational technology to be harnessed.Perhaps the most telling mind-shift was captured by Valery Vavilov, CEO of The Bitfury Group, when he indicated that with Blockchain we can move to a world where people are at the center of their assets, liabilities and personal data, rather than being in the periphery. Indeed, a growing number of entrepreneurs, like Nigeria’s Julius Akinyemi, an entrepreneur-in-residence at MIT’s Media Lab and CEO of UWIN Corp, who is working together with Sandra Ro, one of the chief architects of CME Group’s Bitcoin futures offering, are leveraging Blockchain to pull stranded assets in Africa into the market. These entrepreneurs realize that Blockchain can do to value transfer what the internet did to information sharing.One thing is clear coming from Davos, Blockchain is out of beta and nowhere is this truer than in Asia, where firms like Chong Sing Holdings FinTech Group, whose CEO Phang Yew Kiat is an ardent Blockchain and digital transformation supporter. Mr. Yew Kiat’s firm has successfully processed millions of banking and other highly regulated transactions leveraging Blockchain-based platforms. If the world is moving from analog to digital and from digital to decentralized, firms like Chong Sing are showing the value of leadership, tone at the top and rapid prototyping when it comes to harnessing Blockchain’s potential.Looking beyond financial services and digital identity, which are Blockchain mainstays, some of the more pioneering work is taking place with electrification, energy metering, fractional asset ownership and supply chain provenance. Herein, against the backdrop of endemic Weinstein-style harassment cases and gender governance failures, women are proving to be the most unrelenting leaders in the Blockchain community. Leaders such as Veronica Garcia, CEO of BitLumens is making “last-mile” gains in rural electrification by leveraging Blockchain to not only provide light, but to provide a veritable form of leasing and payment collection. PowerLedger’s co-founder and chair, Jemma Green, proves that with Blockchain-based energy metering, an entirely new energy future is not only possible, it is here. Critically, these breakthroughs enable utilities and governments to rethink their roles, right-size their balance sheets and push for more energy diversification.On supply chains and the provenance of goods and commodities, Leanne Kemp, Everledger’s founder and CEO, is committed to resolving perennial blood diamond issues through a Blockchain-based registry. With this, she is at once solving one of the industry’s most insidious challenges, while opening the door to making diamonds a tradable commodity for the first time. Blockchain’s power of transparency and widescale trust, borne from its unalterable record keeping, are on pace to transform a number of supply chains, from precious metals and gems to food and agriculture. Perhaps with the advent of this technology, commodity producing countries will begin moving up the value chain.With the doomsday clock inching two minutes closer to midnight and on the heels of an annus horibilis for risk, a technology that can sow the seeds of trust, reduce friction and pull stranded assets into the global economy on an unprecedented scale will help drive shared prosperity and resilience. The world will be well served by accelerating Blockchain’s adoption."

that makes it possible has gained more awareness -- blockchain.","Jan 25, 2018,09:30am EST",Shutterstock,"With the rise of Bitcoin, one of the underlying supportive technologies that makes it possible has gained more awareness -- blockchain. The technology of blockchain has many applications to secure transactions and activities outside of the financial sector, including in healthcare and other industries. The U.S. federal government has interest in the application of blockchain for various purposes.What Is Blockchain?Blockchain is a distributed ""chain"" of validated transactions secured through cryptographic hashing. Each block added is stored with timestamp and transaction data along with a cryptographic hash pointer to the previous block. Various open-source and commercial options for blockchain technology exist. The best-known example of the use of blockchain is for securing and recording of Bitcoin transactions. For another example, an organization can use blockchain to analyze whether a mobile device is valid for use inside its corporate systems using various internal identifiers for the device. Another way to think of blockchain is as a trusted ledger of transactions.Adoption Of Blockchain By The U.S. Federal GovernmentWhile the U.S. government was late to embrace cloud computing due to challenges with deciphering the model, lack of suitable procurement options and slow adoption, it appears to be engaging actively with the potential use of blockchain technology. The appeal of blockchain may center on the decentralized nature of the technology along with interoperability and reduced cost outcomes.In one of the first contract awards for blockchain technology implementation for the U.S. government, the Department of Homeland Security awarded a blockchain contract to “Prove Integrity of Captured Data From Border Devices.”The Food & Drug Administration issued a ""sources sought"" notice late in 2017 for an application of blockchain. According to the notice, this was for real-time application for portable interactive devices (RAPID) ""to enable [the] exchange of patient-level data within the United States Critical Illness and Injury Trails Group network."" The FDA requirements noted that “Implementation of the blockchain connection between FDA RAPID and USCIITG/Discovery network is being created in order to exchange influenza patient data at clinical sites administered by USCIITG.”The U.S. Department of Defense Transportation Command also showed a recent interest in blockchain centered on an innovative use of distributed ledger capabilities. Its interest also included extensibility, monitoring and scalability of the technology across extended domains. An example potential application included security and surety of logistics and transportation transactions.U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), in coordination with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC), published a notice that it will be issuing a request for proposal that will include an application of blockchain, among other goals. The MTEC mission is to assist USAMRMC to partner “with industry and academia to augment the supply chain and next generation inventory management capabilities that are utilized to protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters’ health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations.”Barriers To AdoptionQuestions that bring up the most pushback on adoption of blockchain revolve around security, some open source aversion, possible performance issues and reporting/analytics. There are potential security vulnerabilities when it comes to blockchain. For example, if a device is used as part of the security to validate a transaction and that device is later vulnerable, the transactions may become vulnerable, too. In several cases involving Bitcoin and Ethereum, two major uses of blockchain, hackers pinpointed a vulnerability of the digital wallet technology to steal large sums of virtual funds. Failover and continuity are concerns for implementation planning as well as the performance of the database.Industry Offerings For Federal Government BlockchainVarious industry services firms and vendors have expanded certain of their services on the use of blockchain by the federal government.SAP is providing access to blockchain augmented SAP products through its innovation program known as Leonardo. The SAP Leonardo innovation system provides early-stage blockchain capabilities. SAP also announced a blockchain co-innovation program “which aims to provide an opportunity for participants to explore the applications of blockchain technologies.” Multiple members of the program are large U.S. government contractor firms.The NoSQL database platform provides the right database back end for blockchain to achieve scalability, performance and low latency for distributed applications. MongoDB has already found extensive adoption in the U.S. federal government, and its platform provides the assistance layer for blockchain technologies. The MongoDB platform is supporting various commercial blockchain implementations now.IBM has mustered full support for blockchain, including potential client interest in permissioned blockchain. The IBM Watson Health unit is collaborating with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on research for use of blockchain in data processing applications.Watch for increased and publicly noticeable implementations of blockchain by the U.S. federal government in 2018."

However, during the podcast both Tyra and Cross revealed something that casts into question the IRS's justification for such a request -- tune in to find out what it is.After a legal battle, Coinbase managed to restrict the request to users who had transacted in amounts exceeding $14,000, but regardless, the IRS had put crypto users on notice: Pay taxes on your crypto activity.Although he didn't get to say so in the podcast, Cross emailed later to add, ""Coinbase users who might be affected by the IRS summons should consult with a tax advisor to determine whether they are at risk of civil and criminal penalties due to unreported income.""In the podcast, we discuss issues such as: If you've been buying or earning or otherwise obtaining Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies at different prices, which price do you give to the IRS when you report what you paid for something? We also look at how, if you move a crypto from one exchange to the other, then the new exchange won't know what you paid and their tax report will likely be inaaccurate. Plus, Cross points out some ways in which a new tax report from Coinbase can be misleading.Other common tax questions came up such as whether crypto-to-crypto exchanges are taxed -- hint: Cross says his clients are ""aghast"" when they find out the answer -- and how someone should account for any Bitcoin Cash they have received in August.

In tech, advancements in areas like AI and Bitcoin had far-reaching implications across industries. What were once cutting-edge technologies have made their way further into the “real world” and are poised to have a profound impact on the way business is done in 2018. For evidence of this trend, look no further than the real estate sector, where a range of technologies are opening up the horizon and changing the rules, giving real estate professionals new opportunities to thrive. Here are five predictions about tech is leading the real estate industry in 2018.  AIIDC predicts (download required) that 75% of developer teams will use AI technology for at least one business application or service in 2018. This will certainly hold true in real estate, in which success hinges on an agent’s ability to nurture existing and new client relationships. In buying or selling a home, people are making one of the biggest decisions of their lives and the process can be overwhelming, not to mention confusing. It’s important that real estate agents answer questions in a timely manner, but that’s extremely time-consuming. Chatbots, powered by AI, represent a solution. Agents can utilize virtual customer service agents and chatbots to help field questions and automate discussions with clients, freeing up human time to address more complex issues. AI “employees” enable economies of scale opportunities, meaning agents can provide attentive, hands-on, high-quality customized customer care at very little cost.  Big DataAccording to IMB, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created every day. This data holds vast troves of value for real estate agents who can use it to gain insight into customers, understand market trends and improve efficiency. In 2018, big data will transform the real estate industry by making it more transparent. Home evaluation reports, sale prices and demographic data are now in the cloud and can be analyzed to provide more objective appraisals. Heightened transparency will promote better decision making and streamline the sales process so it’s more efficient. In addition, agents can use big data technologies to turn customer data from sources like social media into targeted marketing that delivers the right message to the right customer at the right time.   DronesDrones stand to be one of the most important new technologies to enter real estate marketing since the internet. To start, drones enable agents to integrate dramatic camera photography and video tours into online listings. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) found that 90% of homebuyers rely on the internet as one of their primary research sources, and for over half, the web is their first step. Capturing their attention requires impressive, detailed visuals, and the agents who pull ahead will be those whose photos and videos stand out. Drones can essentially be used as flying cameras for photos and videos. Real estate photographers can use the technology to produce sweeping shots of the landscapes around homes and 360-degree views of home exteriors.Drones will also enable agents to conduct virtual open houses. Fewer than one in five buyers makes an offer without first seeing a house in person, according to a Redfin survey, but open houses aren’t exactly convenient for anyone involved. Drones allow agents to give virtual tours, saving buyers, sellers and agents time, as well as opening the door to buyers who don’t live in the area. Mobile DevicesFor all the talk about how millennials aren’t buying houses, NAR has found over the last four years that millennials and Generation Y make up the largest group of homebuyers. In 2018, the real estate industry will continue to evolve to be more millennial-friendly, which means more mobile-friendly. Millennials spend more time on their phones than any other age group and rely on their mobile devices to do just about everything. The agents who succeed will be those who enable prospects and clients to access all the information they need, including listings and documents, from their mobile devices. Mobile-first will soon become the norm. BitcoinBitcoin captured headlines in 2017 as the value of the cryptocurrency soared to unforetold heights. The impact of Bitcoin extends far beyond asset trading, however. The technology is redefining how money is exchanged and this is having a big impact on real estate. More buyers are interested in paying with cryptocurrency, which is leading some building owners to accept bitcoin as a way to gain a competitive edge. There are also emerging services that provide landlords and tenants a way to pay and receive rent in Bitcoin. Beyond Bitcoin itself, blockchain technology is driving the real estate industry forward in other ways. It could enable multiple listing service (MLS) companies, or even agents, to improve the way property data is shared between agents and consumers, leading to the creation of a national MLS that grants real-time access to updated property information. Blockchain tech could also provide a central database for historical title records. Finally, blockchain technology could provide a new way to verify identities in real estate transactions, speeding up the process and minimizing the risk of fraud. I predict that 2018 is going to be a big year for the real estate industry. Technology will help make the process of buying and selling a home more streamlined, efficient, secure and convenient for everyone involved.  "

But, ""the first version of Ethereum I conceptualized was much less ambitious than what I ended up coming up with a few months later and definitely not as ambitious as what I’m thinking of right now,"" he says on the latest episode of my podcast, Unchained (on Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio).Vitalik Buterin, creator of EthereumButerin also didn't anticipate a number of challenges Ethereum has faced so far, including setting up the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss entity that stewards the development of Ethereum; the DAO, a $50 million theft of a decentralized autonomous venture fund set up on Ethereum that then caused a split in the Ethereum network, resulting in a competing coin called Ethereum Classic; denial-of-service attacks; and scaling challenges.Plus, he says, he initially thought Ethereum would be used for fairly limited purposes: ""if X happened, then send $5 to account Y, if Z happens, send $5 to account B. That’s what I thought Ethereum would be used for. Over time … people starting talking about, Oh, let’s use Ethereum for IoT [Internet of Things] stuff, oh, let’s use Ethereum to implement democracy on the blockchain, Oh, let’s use Ethereum to implement identity systems, supply chain stuff, internet infrastructure, domain name stuff -- and that list just kept on growing very quickly.""Speaking of the differences between his vision and the reality, I brought up a quote by him in this 2016 Wired article in which he says, ""And personally I say screw the big guy. They have enough money already,"" and asked him, if he felt that way, why the Ethereum Enterprise Alliances counts companies such as JPMorgan Chase, BP and Microsoft as members. He responded, ""I do think blockchains empower people who don’t have access to, in part, finance, in part, contracting ability, in part, the ability to make other people trust them already. As far as where big companies fit in, I do think they have a role, and I do think the smart ones who take the first step and are willing to play with the technology rather than against it can survive and even benefit from the whole process."" He explained how Microsoft, in the '90s, was seen as an evil monopoly but that now, compared to cloud companies such as Facebook, which control your data, Microsoft appears less evil because it is ""on the side of people controlling their own stuff. The basic reason is that, with Web companies, you are not their customer, therefore you are their product. With Microsoft, you are still their customer, so they have a bit more of a willingness and incentive to refuse to sell out your data.""We also discussed a tweet in which he asked whether or not the crypto community had earned the $500 billion market cap, though he quipped during the podcast, ""If I was worried at $500 billion, then at $740 billion I’m even more worried."" He did cite a few social-good blockchain projects, such as a United Nations World Food program, though it's currently on a private blockchain. He noted that such projects can't use public blockchains yet due to scaling issues. Pondering governance issues for Ethereum, we debated whether he is a single point of failure for the project and what would happen if he were to leave (a prospect he recently raised in a tweet). For those interested in technical details, we covered proof of work vs. proof of stake consensus algorithms, the pitfalls of on-chain governance, and scaling.Tune in to Unchained (on Google Play, iTunes, iHeartRadio, Stitcher or TuneIn Radio) and this wide-ranging conversation with perhaps the most influential young crypto player now to find out what Buterin worries about, whether he considers other blockchains a threat, how to make fairer initial coin offerings (ICOs), what he thinks of cryptokitties, his take on the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash split, and issues of wealth distribution in crypto.Plus, find out why he says, ""I’ve realized it’s absolutely not true that crypto people are any better than people anywhere else in the world.”"

and ...","Jan 24, 2018,08:00am EST",Shutterstock,"You can’t pull up a news site today without seeing an article or two about Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that allows peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a centralized bank. Most of us are content to stand back a bit to learn more about it before jumping in completely, but we have to admit that we’re intrigued. So, if Bitcoin is the disruptive darling of the day, then it’s probably a good idea to get to know a little bit about its parentage — blockchain — and what that will mean to the world of business and marketing as we hurtle forward.Is blockchain the new internet? For the last 15 years or so, new technologies have emerged that most of us couldn’t have imagined a need for, yet here we are taking advantage of this thing called the internet, social media and now Bitcoin digital transactions. It’s clear that blockchain won’t be going away, so it’s in our best interests to learn as much about it as possible — as soon as possible — so that we, as marketers, can embrace it with full knowledge of its potential as well as its vulnerabilities.Let’s dig in about what blockchain can mean for businesses and why marketers should pay attention to it.Blockchain is the currency of trust. We started with the Bitcoin example and what that means in terms of currency transfers and secure data applications, but blockchain can be utilized by all types of companies. Blockchain is basically a behemoth of a data spreadsheet operating in a decentralized network. Massive amounts of information can be transmitted and appended without compromises in security. No one can alter or destroy a blockchain. That kind of inviolability creates a single point of truth, which will be highly valuable to businesses and marketers. It’s possible that a second currency resulting from blockchain initiatives will be trust. The truth about products and claims will be easily verified via blockchain technology and marketers will be able to capitalize on that like never before.It offers the truth and nothing but the truth when it comes to ad delivery. Blockchain will really hold ad delivery’s feet to the fire because there can be no fuzzy logic when it comes to confirming that a targeted person saw the designated ad for the defined duration. Engagement and ad performance can be verified to ensure optimal frequency with limits set on overserving on an individual basis. For example, a brand could identify ad deliveries from an ad server and release them to mining machines in the blockchain for analysis and fraud scrubbing. This will help identify ads that were delivered to non-live browsers that reported as active. The potential for truth and accuracy is huge and marketers should be excited about the potential for that level of targeting.Blow customer data concerns out of the water. Marketers today live and breathe customer data, and the blockchain will provide a new way to manage that asset to savvy advantage. In addition to the typical customer data collected, what would happen if a brand could pay its customers for even more data related to behavioral and psychographic characteristics? Or possibly reward them for providing personal interests and personally identifiable information such as purchase plan? In exchange, the brand could provide transparency to the customer into how the data is being used in promotions to build on levels of established trust. Blockchain removes data middlemen and vastly improves data security, all leading to customer trust, engagement and long-term loyalty.Build personalized one-to-one connections. Brand storytelling will launch to a completely new level when companies use Blockchain technology. Information on products, especially in the consumer realm, will be instantly available to prospects who will have access to complete supply chain information as well as the full story about a single product. Relevance and authenticity take the lead in these selling situations and brands can appeal to individual consumers with a level of intimacy unseen up to this point. These personalized digital experiences move from one-to-many marketing tactics to one-to-one connections that seem more intimate and enjoyable for consumers. And possibly the best aspect of this marketing is that the story and personal engagement doesn’t make it seem like marketing at all, just a no-pressure experience between a consumer and a product and brand.Corporate accountability and social responsibility take on new transparency. Marketing and public relations operated for years on the development of communications and promises in the form of brand stories. Whether or not the company delivered on the promises was really anybody’s guess as far as the general public was concerned. The driving truth of blockchain will change all that as facts can be checked easily in terms of product and corporate veracity. Broader issues such as legal practices and sustainability issues can also be verified easily, which will make marketers more inclined to present facts without any marketing spin. In terms of marketing initiatives, blockchain will help those interested easily verify that influencers for the company are true influencers meeting the brand’s criteria. In that same vein, it will help verify social media followers and sort out bots from real people.Blockchain may not be used widely right now, but marketers should start immersing themselves in information about the technology today. Not many people fully understood the massive scope of the internet when that landed in our daily lives and the same will be true of blockchain. Embracing and adopting this new technology will give savvy marketers a head start in the next wave of innovation to take the world by storm."

Many tech companies make strategic investments so that they can gain access to technologies, which they believe could be useful for their business or in areas they want to explore. At the time one Ripple or XRP was worth less than a penny vs. the $1.83 it is currently trading.","[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency Bitcoin. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)On Monday morning this past week, a Seeking Alpha article postulated that Seagate’s investment in Ripple could be worth close to $8 billion or half of the company’s market cap. When the stock opened for trading, it spiked up from the previous Friday’s close of $42.94 to $49.70, up 19%. It fell back during the day but still closed up 7% at $46.00.After the market closed on Monday, Seagate positively preannounced its December quarter results. However, it appears that investors were expecting strong results as the stock was up less than 1% on Tuesday and closed at $46.39. For the week, it did increase over $8 or 19%. While the positive pre-announcement and the stock market strength probably contributed to the rise, it appears the Seeking Alpha article also helped.Investment is worth about $1 billion (at current pricing)In reading through three analysts reports, it appears that Seagate’s investment in Ripple is significantly less than what was calculated in the Seeking Alpha article. RBC’s Seagate analyst Amit Daryanani talked with the company’s management and based on their discussion he believes it owns a 2%-3% stake in Ripple through its participation in the Series A and B rounds in 2015 and 2016. Ripple in turn owns about 60% of the actual XRP tokens.At the current market cap of $71 billion (XRP tokens are currently at $1.83), a 2.5% ownership of Ripple Labs, which controls 60% of the tokens, is worth just over $1 billion. This in turn is about 7% of Seagate’s market cap. Cryptocurrencies are very volatileThree months ago, Ripple’s XRP price was $0.26, which translated to a $10 billion market cap. On Monday, its price ranged from $1.93 to $2.78 per Yahoo! Finance, which means its market cap had about a $33 BILLION market cap swing in 1 DAY.If Ripple was to unload a large percentage of its XRP holdings, it would almost assuredly crash the value of the tokens which would decrease the value of Seagate’s investment.Don’t count your chickens before they hatchSeagate’s investment is in Ripple Labs, which owns about 60% of the XRP token. This isn’t the same as owning a lot of cryptocurrency that can be liquidated. This could be a very nice windfall for Seagate but unless Ripple Labs sells the tokens and distributes the cash, it could be hard for Seagate to monetize this investment. This then means the investment’s value should be discounted to less than $1 billion.You can check out my other Forbes articles, “9 Reasons Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Or More” and “Kodak And Long Island Ice Tea Embracing Blockchain Is Just Like Dot Com In 1999.

DigixDAO was the first crowdsale conducted via Ethereum and the first major Ethereum-based Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO).DGX vs. DGDThe Digix network has two related native assets: Digix Gold Tokens (DGX) and Digix DAO Tokens (DGD).DGX tokens are positioned as the future gold-standard for Ethereum. Each DGX represents 1 gram of physical gold (99.99% LBMA) stored in a safe house. This asset-backed tokenization stabilizes the DGX price (short of some major drop or spike in the value of gold itself); the current jump in DGD does not have to do with DGX directly.DGX TokenDGD tokens are the more speculative arm of Digix, allowing participants to claim quarterly rewards on the DGX collected through transaction fees. The number of DGD is fixed at 2,000,000, keeping the quantity scarce and finite. In theory, this means that movement in DGD reflects the general speculation around the value of gold—the higher the transaction volume and/or price of DGD, the greater the interest in securing gold-backed DGX.DGD TokenProof of Asset (PoA) ProtocolDGD is based on a Proof-of-Asset protocol, which marries real-world governance and blockchain technology. According to DigixDAO, this ensures (as the name implies) the asset-backed protocol, which can apply not only to gold but other financial assets. According to a 2016 blog post:The PoA protocol can be used for land title deeds, ownership titles, stocks, bonds, debt credits, etc. Anything and everything can be securitized with our protocol.According to CoinMarketCap, the DGD price was $240.74 at 5:09pm PST Feb. 1.

On November 27, CNBC reported that there were 13.3 million users for Coinbase, the leading U.S. platform for buying and selling Bitcoin. In contrast, Charles Schwab maintained 10.6 million active brokerage accounts.With that said, technology is evolving at a rapid pace and 2018 will be the year that blockchain, the backbone behind cryptocurrencies, establishes itself as the fastest-growing digital technology since the evolution of the internet. The blockchain is a distributed incorruptible digital technology infrastructure which maintains a fully encoded database that serves as a ledger where all transactions are recorded and stored. For those not familiar with blockchain, here's a good primer for beginners.Today, startups are jumping on the blockchain and looking for ways to promote their idea or company above the noise. These companies understand that we are in the midst of a “Gold Rush” and are laser-focused on promoting their solution to drive interest, raise capital and increase market share.Many companies are being built to leverage blockchain to create greater efficiencies and maximize the current frenzy. (Full Disclosure: My company started an accelerator for blockchain businesses, helping them grow from concept to reality to widespread adoption.)With Blockchain technology migrating from early adopter status to mainstream adoption, below are three ways blockchain will disrupt traditional business and impact marketing in 2018.1. Capital SecurityAccess to capital is currently one of the major challenges startups face, as the ability to fund an idea and grow a business is burdensome. Lending options are not the same around the globe, and blockchain levels the playing field in the global economy.Firms and agencies do not always have the ability to raise capital efficiently as costs of loans and transaction fees make the process a non-starter. Blockchain will ultimately serve as an engine for securing capital since cryptocurrencies are decentralized and there are no fees associated with them. Entrepreneurs can benefit from the blockchain by accepting funding from angel investors and venture firms the world over, in quick time.The quicker companies are to (more easily) secure capital, the quicker they'll be to invest in building their teams and promoting their business. In particular, a larger yield of startups will lead to a higher overall marketing spend, which will impact the addressable market for agencies and firms alike.2. Real-Time AutomationBlockchain essentially automates processes, and formal client agreements will benefit from a fully automated approval process. Often, blockchain is referenced as a “smart” ledger/contract. Implementing blockchain as a replacement for the typical multiple executive approval processes would cut down project delays and create a universal agreement across business sectors impacting both clients and agencies.Similarly, blockchain can automate the sourcing, supply chain and procurement processes by tracking responsibilities throughout their life cycle, which would ensure accurate data and accountable transactions. This would disrupt the way marketers engage with and service their clients.Agencies will be impacted by automation as it reshapes the relationship amongst your business and customers. Automation in smart contracts and/or sourcing provides real-time updates and a live snapshot that provides for seamless reporting from all transactions, tracing the actions and deliverables effectively.3. Influx Of StartupsBlockchain has begun to generate excitement, and entrepreneurs will attempt to devise the “next big thing” via the use of the blockchain network. Many will see blockchain as the next dot-com opportunity. As companies form to leverage blockchain, the investment community will follow as they did in the 1990s. The excitement and push to build blockchain businesses will spur the economy and ultimately create a robust market for agencies to service blockchain companies.Blockchain companies need marketing to position their startups above the noise. Leveraging agency expertise will help these companies grow and position them for success. A forward-facing company with a crisp look and a targeted message will build its brand and put itself in a position for investment. For the marketing industry, blockchain provides the largest addressable market since the 1990s.In the early 90s, the internet was something that many didn’t fully understand or realize the impact it could have on our future. Back then, companies were quick to add the dot-com suffix to their name in an attempt to build off the growing momentum. Similarly, fast-forward to 2018 and companies are adding “blockchain” to their name purely to increase valuations.According to Bloomberg, Long Island Iced Tea Corporation changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation after it received an ultimatum from Nasdaq in October. When Nasdaq threatened to delist Long Island Iced Tea unless its market value rose above $35 million for 10 consecutive business days, it added “Blockchain” to its name and achieved the target market value via a surging stock price. Kodak has also stepped into the field, announcing the roll-out of KodakCoin.As 2018 progresses, it will be interesting to see if the cryptocurrency bubble bursts. If there is a market correction, will it impact the excitement around blockchain? In fact, most speculative investors in cryptocurrencies don’t fully understand the difference between crypto and blockchain, and their investment in crypto is really an investment in the blockchain.In short, as blockchain continues to evolve, we’ll see a changing dynamic within the marketing community. Business transactions will get a makeover and this will create a verified transparent network that will ensure privacy and security. This will be the year that blockchain goes mainstream, and the adoption of its processes will lead to a boom that will disrupt traditional business and impact marketing."

Bitcoin has had a short yet storied history, but while most of the headlines focus on bitcoin as an asset, many of the most impactful applications actually center around the underlying technology — the blockchain. Blockchain technology is transforming industries, including real estate, to make them more modern and efficient. Blockchain technology is having an impact on the way we do business in real estate in these three key ways: 1. MLS Property DataAt its core, blockchain is the ability to share databases and processes. This opens up promising opportunities to make real estate data, which is principal to the process of buying and selling homes, more centralized and accessible. 
Every real estate transaction goes through the multiple listing service (MLS), which tracks what agents represent which clients, contracts, listing agreements, appraisals and more. However, the MLS is notoriously fragmented. The information is decentralized and restricted, making access difficult for people who are not real estate professionals. It’s often out-of-date as well, which hampers an agent’s ability to make comparisons and spot trends. Blockchain technology can be used to overcome these barriers within the MLS. By providing a way to securely share data, the blockchain makes a shared, nationwide database possible, one that offers real-time access to property information straight from the source and enables a more holistic view. It also opens up more opportunities for collaboration among players in the real estate industry.2. Title RecordsTitle records are another decentralized, challenging-to-access aspect of the real estate buying/selling process. Even in 2017, title information remains stored at the local level and is offline. With the blockchain, this is starting to change.In 2016, Cook County, Illinois began the nation's first to experiment with blockchain technology for transferring and tracking property titles. When someone buys a property they receive a digital token and the traditional paper deed. The accompanying documentation of the token transfer is used as proof of ownership. Eventually, tokens could become the standard and take the place of paper deeds altogether.The blockchain could provide a central title database for the entire country to securely store and instantly access historical title records, allowing for the streamlining of title transfer in a property sale. Inman called the Cook County experiment “one of real estate’s most important experiments with blockchain so far.” 3. TransactionsThe third area of real estate that the blockchain will transform is the efficiency and the security of transactions. The blockchain does not require there to be trust between two parties to conduct business. Each user has a unique identity on the blockchain via cryptography, which means consumer financial information can be shared securely with other parties during transactions. One person can send funds to another person that won’t release until the transaction is formally completed. This layer of security speeds up the transaction management process. Whether or not the buyer and seller are in the same place, property financing is sped up by the existence of a centralized financial record for each party.Blockchain technology streamlines the real estate ecosystem by enabling people to securely and efficiently share data and money. It makes information more accessible, cuts out middlemen and reduces the risk of fraud and theft. A more secure, speedier, trusted process for buying and selling property is good for everyone involved.  "

I had made the plunge into cryptocurrency after much hemming, a deal of hawing and a couple of agonizing days watching the price fluctuate as Coinbase chugged my USD into ETH. My first bet on Ripple (XRP) paid off handsomely, though not so handsomely as it would have had I been able to buy it when I wanted to. A subsequent bet on Tron (TRX), worked out even better, and for a moment it even seemed like I had been able to staunch the bleed off of a Ripple peak by moving those coins into Tron -- a successful trade from the successful investor, clearly. You can see where this is going.[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]Prices collapsed, both across the board but moreso for my coins in particular. The Coinbase coins -- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin -- haven't been hit as hard as the smaller coins, and Ethereum, in particular, is still up overall. But the altcoins are getting hammered, and where there once was money now there is not. Perhaps there never was.The reasons are various: South Korea is considering getting aggressive about regulating cryptocurrencies, and the entire market is suffering as a result. South Korean traders, for a time, seemed to be responsible for the atmospheric rise in Ripple, after all. And then there are the cracks: Ripple is a promising idea for transferring funds, but the reality of it is that there's no reason why banks or businesses would have to use the XRP coin to take advantage of the Ripple platform. Tron was accused of plagiarism and had largely risen on market momentum and obscure promises: the traders left once they realized incredible gains. In a general sense the market got oversold, people took profits and an adjustment was made. No asset can quintuple in value every week.And yet sitting here in midst of a major selloff offers a fascinating glimpse into the mindset of the crypto community. The Reddit communities for Tron and Ripple are as unconcerned right now as they were last week: prices will stabilize at some point, they say, and they'll be back. To many, the price collapse isn't a reason to despair but a reason to rejoice -- it's just a sale on coins. It's time to load up, wait out the saps and return stronger than ever. I don't know when these people bought their Ripple but it's possible that many are still up several multiples despite the recent collapse, and so they may know something I don't.To all the believers out there RT !!!! Let's hold and kill the Whales !! $TRON $TRXSpread the WORD!! We are not giving you our coins!!! #HODL #HODLgangRT RT RT !!! #TRON #TRX pic.twitter.com/818thPwQuU— Paparazzi Stocks (@PaparazziStocks) January 12, 2018People point to Bitcoin and to Ethereum -- coins that doubtless had their cycles of bubble and bust but always came back, coins that have now delivered massive returns for those investors with the foresight to tough out the lean times. It's a philosophy called HODL, an appropriately meme-oriented investment strategy. Some would call it an acronym -- Hold On for Dear Life -- while others would just call it a drunken misspelling of ""hold"" from an old forum post. Regular investors would just call it being long on a stock, but the crypto world has no time for such arcane phraseology. It's the idea that the price will go up, even if already went down. It's the idea that noobs are the ones who panic and sell, but seasoned crpyto investors double down. For some, HODL is a researched position, for others it feels like more of a philosophical stance akin to the power of positive thinking. For a long time, at least for a number of coins, HODL has been a sound strategy. The space has grown in fits and starts, but it has grown. There's no guarantee that it will keep doing so in the future.And this is where things get dangerous. I believed these coins would succeed two weeks ago: am I really so fickle? And if I haven't stopped believing, why aren't I pouring more money into the market and snapping up the cheap coins before the price skyrockets again. It was just last week I was doing calculations on what price TRX would need to hit for me to make X amount of money: here's an opportunity to bring that price way down. I gave myself a limit on how much I would invest, but are these the thoughts of a sucker? Or are they the last gasp of a rational brain resisting being totally overtaken by a sucker?It turns out that the mind games a selloff plays with you are no different than the mind games a bubble plays with you. Lurking in the middle of all of this is the notion that you are not a leaf on the wind but rather a savvy operator who can best the market trends through grit and guile. There was a sequence of decisions that could have made this all work, after all. I could have recognized the bubble when it happened and moved all of my assets into USDT, a currency meant to stick as close to $1 a coin as possible. Or I could have bought Ethereum, which was going up when other things were crashing. Then I could move back into Tron and Ripple once they hit bottom, losing nothing in real value but tripling or quadrupling my crypto holdings. I had an inkling the price was cresting, after all, and perhaps next time I can just trust that instinct and make each right move at each right time. Perhaps next time that instinct will be dead wrong.I'll hold, though I'm not sure I'm HODL, at least not like those other guys. I always told myself I was making bets and seeing how they'd land: it's the same whether they're down or up. The headline states that I lost $3,000 on Ripple and Tron, which is true and not true -- just like it was when I had made that money. I still have a bunch of cryptocurrency, not USD, and it's still anyone's guess how much it's worth. If only I could stop refreshing that price.Disclosure: The author participates in cryptocurrency markets and holds long positions on Ripple and Tron. "

[+] electricity, water and tangible goods. (Photo by Maxim KimerlingTASS via Getty Images)","Although much of the excitement surrounding blockchain has been generated by the financial services industry, blockchain’s benefits extend beyond cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, distributed general ledgers and other financial transactions. The technology can actually be used to facilitate, verify and log any type of transaction in a way that’s faster, more seamless and more secure than ever before.In addition to transforming how we exchange money, blockchain has the potential to reshape how we distribute critical commodities like energy and water, and consequently how we think about the systems that support them. Unlike financial services, infrastructure — our roads, water pipelines, electrical grids and so on — deals with physical commodities. The data corresponding to an infrastructure transaction is merely metadata. It represents the underlying physical thing that is being transacted, but is distinct from the thing itself. Financial data, by comparison, isn’t a representation of money — it is the money. The numbers in your checking account are the assets you’re transacting, whereas the numbers on your electricity bill are just representations of the energy you’ve received. Because of this, infrastructure stakeholders typically think of their job as moving or supporting the movement of a physical thing from one place to another, be it water, electricity or goods. There is already a growing market for software and devices that enhance utility operations and service delivery, but these tools don’t fundamentally change how utilities and companies deliver value to customers. The mere ""digitization"" of assets — placing sensors in pipelines or RFID tags on equipment, for example — underestimates the role that digital can play in transforming physical systems and processes. In the oil and gas industry, for instance, the concept of a digital twin has recently emerged to describe the digital representation of a physical system or machine. These digital twins can help people make better decisions, but they don’t change the principles of how you move oil from one place to another. Deploying specialized mobile communications tools to field workers may help you increase efficiency, but it doesn’t change how your business works. The Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) can optimize physical systems through sensors, data and connectivity, but IoT applications are still built on top of existing devices and processes. Conventional digital tools may improve the way things work, but they don’t fundamentally alter the structure of infrastructure. Blockchain, on the other hand, offers infrastructure leaders the opportunity to not only increase efficiency and reduce costs, but evolve how physical commodities are distributed and consumed. Brooklyn Microgrid, for example, leverages blockchain to enable peer-to-peer energy trading, allowing users to generate and sell excess power instantly and securely to neighbors. As part of its Smart Cities and Suburbs Program, the Australian government is investing millions in blockchain-enabled technology to reimagine how both electricity and water are distributed. The shipping and logistics industry has also seen a boom in potentially transformative blockchain initiatives. IBM and Maersk recently launched a joint venture to create a single platform that can digitize global trade, and shipping giants like UPS and FedEx are working with the Blockchain in Transport Alliance to set industry standards as they explore ways of using blockchain to track shipments, manage logistics and replace freight brokers — opportunities which represent over $500 billion in market value according to Morgan Stanley.These applications of blockchain don’t just make existing systems more efficient, they change how, from whom and through whom services are provided. Like it has done in the financial industry, blockchain decentralizes distribution and eliminates middlemen and middleware. In these use cases, blockchain is part of the physical process. It's not creating a digital twin. It's using a digital framework to unlock new ways of managing tangible commodities. Given this potential, blockchain is likely a better candidate to challenge the physically-focused mindsets that dominate infrastructure today than other digital technologies. Although other technologies, from sensors to apps, can play an important part of infrastructure's evolution, they only augment and improve existing systems but don’t change how those systems work. To truly push the boundaries of infrastructure innovation, industry leaders must start using digital technologies to transform how our physical systems operate, not just virtually represent their operation. Blockchain, while far from a panacea, helps us achieve this by uniting the physical and the digital on a deeper level — a critical step if we want digital technologies to have the same level of impact on infrastructure as they have on other industries.

","Luckbox is launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) very soon and is aggressively marketing the offering across Africa. I recently caught up with him in Sandton, Johannesburg, where we briefly talked about Luckbox, his upcoming ICO and the future of cryptocurrencies.What were the motivations to launch Luckbox as a digital platform and pivot towards the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) market?As a concept, Luckbox has been a couple of years in the making in various guises, with the co-founder, Mike Stevens, and I arriving together from separate angles.We both have a background in the gambling industry - we met when we worked together at PokerStars in London - but went our separate ways with other work after that. We got our heads together again in 2015, when Mike was in the early stages of planning to build an online casino.
I’m a massive e-sports fan and it was clear that the phenomenal growth was only just beginning. In 2015, global e-sports revenue was worth an estimated $325m and the figure has doubled since then. I’d been thinking a lot about gambling in e-sports, which was then in its infancy, and investing in its enormous potential. Mike and I were soon on the same page and it grew from there.We’d also both spent a lot of time looking at cryptocurrencies, trading and researching and, with the emergence of ICOs as a serious way of raising funds, the stars aligned for us. We already had our business plan, so it was a case of taking that to our connections in the cryptocurrency world and getting their thoughts.We’ve had some fantastic support thus far - not just by way of contributions, but advice too - and we’re so grateful for that.You are marketing your ICO in South Africa in addition to other geographies. What are your predictions as to the application of BitCoin and cryptocurrencies in Africa?Well, one of the most attractive aspects about crypto is the access it offers to such territories.In many parts of Africa, like Nigeria for instance, there is a huge interest in e-sports and a huge passion for gambling. Gambling may be legal, but the banking system may not be onboard, so players need to find other ways to pay.Crypto is a fantastic solution. Not only is it secure, but transactions can be faster and cheaper than traditional payment methods. It’s our intention to allow customers to deposit and play with Fiat, in-game items (e.g. 'skins') and crypto.Crypto is central to our plans and not just for raising money. In fact, our ICO is highly unusual because of our dual-token offering.We’ll have our own utility token that players can buy during the ICO and then later use to play with on the platform. This will have advantages for the consumer, including enhanced bonuses and loyalty rewards.We’ll also have a second token that accredited investors can buy to become entitled to a share in the company’s annual profits themselves. This excitingly means that our contributors can share in the long-term success of Luckbox as we grow, which we intend to do rapidly.Generally speaking crypto has huge potential in the emerging marketplace and many businesses have already woken up to this. The development of smart contracts will be huge. Transactional costs will be lower, people will not need traditional bank accounts and there’s far less risk of corruption.Is there an inherent Social Responsibility (CSR) in allowing efficient access to mobile finance, available in one's domestic currency?Very much so. Anything that mitigates difficulties or financial drawbacks for the consumer, should, of course, be welcomed and implemented. Traditionally, costs to the provider and third parties prevented this from being practical or possible but this dynamic is diminishing fast.In a modern global economy there really is no justification for someone to pay higher fees just because their native currency is different. The advent of blockchain and its increased adoption underlines this school of thought.Aside from being a responsible ethos, it’s simply about providing a better service - and having that service available to as many customers as possible. Companies who do not embrace this shift will find themselves being left behind.Where do you see the future of BitCoin valuation and Luckbox’s ICO in five years’ time?Bitcoin is infamous for its volatility but the long-term trend is towards mainstream adoption for cryptocurrencies.That being said, Bitcoin at present can’t handle any meaningful transaction volumes, does not have smart contract functionality, consumes an abhorrent amount of electricity, and the governance model has resulted in a civil war between proponents of different solutions to scalability.This situation is unlikely to change in the short to mid term, which may seriously damage its first-mover advantages (e.g. brand recognition, fiat gateways, main pair against other cryptocurrencies), as many other cryptos are technologically superior.Trying to predict a future value of Bitcoin - or any crypto - has the potential to leave one looking very foolish. The continued rise of Bitcoin is completely plausible, but this relies on it continuing to benefit from network effects and being commonly accepted as a store of value.As for Luckbox, we are issuing two tokens. One is 'LuckCash' which is a utility token for our platform; the other is 'LuckProfits' which has a contractual right to a share of net profits.While the purpose of LuckCash is not speculation or as an investment, there is the inevitable pressure of supply and demand which may cause its exchange rate to appreciate quite significantly over time, but savvy contributors should consider the LuckProfit token as we plan for the value of both of our tokens to increase.Five hours is a long time in crypto, let alone five years, but we have a really experienced management team and a fleet of developers who have a track record of being able to deliver.As we progress and showcase our capabilities, demand for both tokens will increase and so will their value.Follow me on Twitter @MfonobongNsehe"

The market may be cooling a bit from mid-December when all a company had to do to skyrocket its stock price was add ""blockchain"" to its name, but bulls in the space are still eagerly searching for ways to apply the relatively new technology to all sorts of different areas. Gaming -- long a pioneer in virtual economies -- is far from immune. There have been a number of gaming-focused cryptocurrency projects large and small that promise to bring the decentralized, trustless ethos of blockchain to the gaming world, though as always it can be hard to find the signal in the noise. But is widespread adoption of cryptocurrency in gaming a pipe dream?At first blush, cryptocurrency and gaming would seem to compliment each other on some thematic levels. Video games, after all, are the vehicle by which many people got used to the idea of buying virtual goods with real money: it wasn't all that long ago that people were doubting that a company could make any money selling virtual cows in Farmville, and now people are speculating with tens of thousands of dollars on cryptokitties. On top of that, nearly every game with an in-game economy already functions with its own kind of virtual currency -- gold, diamonds, credits, etc. -- that players buy with real money. It's a one-way street, and so we're still a long way off from a real currency -- you can buy Candy Crush Gold with USD, but you can't buy USD with Candy Crush Gold. Still, some of those building blocks would appear to be in place.Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities notes that there would seem to be some benefits to a theoretical cryptocurrency adoption, at least from the gamer's perspective. The biggest is portability: if multiple games were to all of a sudden start using the same blockchain, gamers would be able to use the same money in different games, offering a great deal more flexibility than a system where every game has its own currency. You could also sidestep credit cards, which are still how most video game micro-transactions operate. That could be big in developing markets, though it pre-supposes a wider adoption.""The latter is not that big of a deal for existing gamers (most have credit or debit cards), but could expand the market beyond the current base,"" Michael Pachter.The benefits to gaming companies, however, are less clear. The rampant speculation that's become endemic to the cryptocurrency ecosystem could add a massive complicating factor that a developer or a game might just not be equipped to deal with, and the looming possibility of crashes would be threatening to long-term plans. A developer might find themselves with a popular game based on a plummeting coin, meaning that it could be losing money even as it gained players. And that portability would be sure to make lots of companies nervous: there's a reason that we haven't seen systems like that before, and it's because developers are afraid of letting people take their money out of their ecosystems whenever they want.Candy Crush Saga. PHILIPPE HUGUEN/AFP/Getty Images""The problem is bigger across games. It’s do-able, but free-to-play publishers live in the dream world that players 'only' play their game and not others,"" says Pachter. ""They don’t perceive a need to allow players to 'cash out.'  Think about it like a slot machine, where you can take your money at any time.  Gambling houses figured that out decades ago, but game companies haven’t yet. You can’t even use gold across games published by the same company (like King games—Candy Crush, et al.).  Yes, they should figure it out, and no, they won’t.  The publishers fear that if they let a gamer cash out, he’ll leave and never come back; if they require the gamer to keep the cash in the game, they’re more likely to spend it.""If King can't even be convinced to let you spend Candy Crush Saga Gold in Candy Crush Soda Saga, it's easy to see how a more ambitious system could run into roadblocks.One of the main benefits of cryptocurrency is that speculators -- and potentially gamers -- could see a real cash return on investments of either time, resources or money. There have been plenty of tiny games that reward players with small amounts of Bitcoin, after all. But inserting such systems into a bigger game could be a good way to place a lot of risk at the developer's doorstep with most of the benefit going elsewhere. Convincing reputable developers to take the plunge would be a real challenge for any gaming-oriented coins, though at least one established developer is working on its own coin: the somewhat embattled Crytek is hoping ""crycash"" might garner some new players for its free to play game Warface. David Cole of DFC Intelligence is skeptical of the entire space, suspecting that it may be long past its prime for investors or potential applications. It's worth noting that we've been here before: Steam recently stopped accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment both because of skyrocketing transaction fees and a level of volatility that makes it hard for any company to run a non-speculative business. The former problem is specific to Bitcoin, the latter is not. Still, while the benefits for established companies like Valve are nebulous, cryptocurrency might be a better proposition for newer developers and games.""It seems to tie right into that gaming demographic audience, and it is somewhat of a game,"" says Cole. ""Games are doing a ton of stuff on virtual goods, selling items and really trying to figure out the most effective way to build consumers. And cryptocurrency, the whole idea is that more and more places are going to adopt it. Free-to-play games are going to be one of the first places to do that.""The vendor-side complications, the risk and the volatility just make it a tough proposition, Cole says. The problem, to some degree, is that it's actually relatively easy to imagine a future system where tons of different virtual economies run off a single decentralized cryptocurrency, and that future holds many interesting possibilities for how players and developers create and distribute content. How we get there, however, is much harder to conceive of. Right now, cryptocurrency needs a hit to make it in gaming: a new, novel game that both uses the concept in an interesting way and packages it with a successful game to boot. Without that, it's hard to see how this works."

He’s vice president of research at Pindrop, a voice security startup, showing off the future on a jail-broken demo device.Moments after Garland is finished, his colleague Elie Khoury, Pindrop’s principal research scientist, asks the Echo device to sell another $7 and that he’s ready to proceed. “I think you are trying to imitate Matt Garland,” the device replies, denying the request.Several years from now, Pindrop CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan believes such transactions and fail-safes will be commonplace. Shoppers will be able to wire money across an echo or Google Home device using only their voices, or book a cross-country flight hands-free during their commute. It’s a vision of the future – and of a much bigger market need for Pindrop – that Balasubramaniyan and his researchers have been chasing for years.The release of Pindrop Passport, a new authentication tool that the startup unveiled on Thursday, is a big first step. Passport scans a caller’s voice, behavior (how they press their phone to input a pin) and the phone’s signature (whether it’s rerouted or from the wrong geography) to come up with risk scores in the time it takes to speak a sentence, the company says. That quick verification process not only reduces fraud but can shave as much as 55 seconds off the average call – equivalent to $1 saved in employee time, and potentially millions annually.“When I started Pindrop in 2011, I was pitching it as articles across the board talking about the death of phone calls,” says Balasubramaniyan. “By the end of 2018, we will hit 1.1 billion calls.”With $122 million raised from top investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Institutional Venture Partners and Google parent Alphabet’s growth equity fund CapitalG, Pindrop is a leading force in the remote office world of call center tech. Pindrop carries a $600 million valuation as of its last funding, according to data tracker PitchBook. Pindrop says half its customers come from America’s 500 biggest companies by revenue, including five of the top seven U.S. life insurers and eight of the 10 biggest banks. The company signed its first $10 million-plus contract in the Americas in 2014 and its first outside the U.S. two years later, with average contract now running more than $1 million across its business. And the startup says its renewal rate for 2017 was 100%, with 70% of customers expanding their use.Pindrop's principal research scientist Elie Khoury, right, was tasked with cracking the technical... [+] challenges of identifying voices fast.All those customers signed up for Pindrop’s original voice printing service. In 2015, Balasubramaniyan wanted more. Pindrop had steadily increased the number of features it used to identify phones—Pindrop tracks 1,380 today, up from 32 identified in Balasubramaniyan’s original PhD thesis – with a team of 50 PhDs working on the system under Garland. But Pindrop didn’t use customers’ own voices to authenticate because the systems failed too often, as much as 18% of the time using real data, the company says. That made it too likely to be beat by a fraudster to trust.To bring down those error rates, the startup brought in Khoury, a researcher in voice recognition who’d written several top papers in the field. Khoury’s team was able to drop them to 4% in just five months, and Pindrop went to the market to pitch the tool to customers. No one was buying. “I was pretty sure everyone would pat me on the back, and that didn’t happen” says Balasubramaniyan. “They loved the system.” But it took too long.To identify someone’s voice, Khoury and Garland needed 60 seconds of audio of a customer to set a baseline, then calls of at least 15 seconds to identify them after that. For banks and other big companies, that solution wouldn’t be any faster than using non-voice methods such as security questions and a PIN. “I could almost hear the squeal of the balloon deflating,” Garland says of the moment when Pindrop’s researchers had to go back to the drawing board.The answer proved to be deep learning, an area of artificial intelligence in which Pindrop let a computer do the heavy lifting for them. Modeling out a range of factors that influence a person’s speech, such as the shape of their mouth and throat and then duplicating an audio clip over hundreds of slightly different simulations using distortions and background noise, Khoury was able to get neural networks to identify what humans could not: the traits and patterns made a voice unmistakably one person in any context. To factor in how a voice ages, he studied a person whose samples were easily available on a weekly basis over an eight-year period: former U.S. President Barack Obama.The result is a system that can tag a person’s voice in just one second, or the time it takes to try to make a prank order on someone else’s Echo device. And while technology exists to artificially reproduce someone’s voice (Pindrop played me a clip of my own voice, at once recognizable but slightly off, and then one that sounded unmistakably like President Donald Trump), the system can tell when a voice was synthetically stitched together due to limits in our ability to simulate a person’s exact vocal chords.Balasubramaniyan argues he’s tripled his market opportunity with the release of Passport. He points to Pindrop’s first two contracts involving the service as evidence. One customer signed up for a seven-figure deal without ever working with Pindrop previously, the CEO says. Then an existing customer signed a five-year commitment to use Passport right out of the gate. He says Pindrop’s goal is to quintuple that in 2018, bringing Passport to at least 10% of Pindrop’s current customers.To build a business that would make board member and former Cisco CEO John Chambers proud, Balasubramaniyan will need to eventually break Pindrop out of the call center. Its quarters, even several years away, but the entrepreneur’s deeper ambition is to use Passport as a voice identity platform that recognizes people wherever they go. “I can see a future where we no longer use passwords or pins,” he says. “Everything can know who you are by your voice and what you do.”Pindrop is in talks with automakers about bringing its tech to connected cars and with airlines about check-in kiosks and even cockpits powered by voice. Balasubramaniyan’s vision won’t be possible without buy-in from the device makers themselves, as they control the audio. Pindrop works with Amazon already through its contact center business, but Amazon doesn’t share Echo data yet. Pindrop may have better luck with transportation companies and industrial companies with IoT sensors before it gets the blessing of Apple, Facebook or Google.“There was nothing called voice commerce until Alexa came around. Now companies with voice will sell 30% more than those without,” Balasubramaniyan says. “Now we will see a resurgence in a conversational economy.”Balasubramaniyan was right about phone calls not going away when he founded Pindrop years ago. If he’s right again, his startup has a chance to be the security layer for a new voice economy."

Does it really matter that there are fewer women in tech than men? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.","Answer by Samantha Radocchia, Co-Founder at Chronicled, on Quora:I was recently joking around on Twitter during a conference. I wrote:“Only at a blockchain conference is the line for the men’s bathroom around the block, and no one is in the women’s restroom.”It was funny to me because you never see that happen, but the responses I got were disheartening. Many said the tweet made them sad because it was so indicative of the actual situation in blockchain.They’re right. While there are generally more women in the blockchain industry than in tech, there’s still a sizable diversity problem. And it’s not just women—people of color, people with varied socioeconomic backgrounds, and varied sexual orientations and genders are also incredibly underrepresented at the moment.I want to take a moment and reflect on why that is, and discuss how we can instill change that ensures the industry is welcoming to people from all walks of life.The Current SituationThe origins of blockchain and cryptocurrency are part of the reason why the industry lacks diversity. The early days of blockchain and crypto consisted mainly of hacktivists and cypherpunks. And while their motivations were well intentioned, the demographic was mostly white males. Fast forward 10 or so years, and look at the contemporary origins of blockchain and cryptocurrency: tech and finance—areas which are still struggling to become more representative of the population as a whole.Tech and finance are very white, heteronormative industries. There are a range of issues implicit in that disparity. For one thing, socioeconomic and gender diversity is lacking. And although I could talk all day about the challenges that women face in the tech industry, that would be overlooking the significant socioeconomic factors that work to discourage anyone outside of that traditional white, heteronormative sphere.Today, Black and Latinx workers combined make up only 5% of the tech industry workforce. Individuals who don’t hold traditional degrees are also struggling for representation. At IBM—a company actively working to hire skilled workers without degrees—only 10% to 15% of new hires don’t hold traditional degrees. And the 2017 Tech Leavers study found 1 in 10 women experienced unwanted sexual attention, while LGBT employees were most likely to be bullied and/or experience public humiliation.That’s indicative of systemic issues in the industry that aren’t necessarily just about women.If you’re wondering why that is, think about how much it really costs to get involved with blockchain or buy bitcoin. You need a computer and internet access. You need a proper education and the resources to be able to buy bitcoin in the first place. Large groups of people are immediately excluded from participating in the industry as owners of production, in the Marxist sense.On the other hand, cryptocurrencies themselves are accessible to the mass market and general public via easily accessible applications like Coinbase. I often overhear restaurant workers and Uber drivers discussing their crypto portfolios.So, what’s stopping the industry itself from becoming easily accessible?Barriers To DiversityAnother concerning trend I’ve noticed is the emergence of big institutional investors on the blockchain scene. The cryptocurrency price surges draw these investors from the finance industry—a field that’s traditionally been dominated by white men.This has led to audience changes in the meetings and events I attend. In some cases, it’s gone from a very collaborative group in casual clothing to bankers wearing button-up suits. It’s very exclusionary and male-dominated, seemingly only for the elite. That’s not a direction that we want to go, but it may be hard to avoid.That said, the capital that’s flowing in from these traditional industries is going to affect blockchain. We might soon see the SEC make a judgement about regulating tokenized ecosystems and ICOs. All of that is going to impact diversity—and not necessarily in a good way.Here’s why that’s true:Early on in my career, I found fundraising to be incredibly difficult. Some of the male venture capitalists could be extremely patronizing, but that wasn’t even the worst of it. Others would put out sketchy offers for dates or meetings in a hotel lobby—or even their rooms. And I’m definitely not alone in that regard. I still talk to people who’ve had the same experiences in the blockchain community. With the increasing influx of money and crypto assets, there are going to be more people taking advantage of their powerful positions.These are the outside forces that could lead to a worsening in the diversity problem facing blockchain tech. But I’m still optimistic, because it isn’t all bad news.The Push For More DiversityWe are slowly seeing improvement in the representation of women and minorities in blockchain. That’s especially true in the event circuit and panels, where many organizers have made a commitment to put varied voices on the stage.This is so important, because the end goal is to have a diverse group of public figures. These figures encourage others to get involved and show underrepresented groups they are supported in the industry. We want any young person to look at a blockchain company or event and see themselves represented in a meaningful way.Another good sign is that 46% of Coinbase’s new hires this year were either women or ethnically diverse. In the end, that’s what it’s going to take. Multiple parties all pushing for a more diverse and inclusive industry that’s willing to tap into the largest pool of talent available.Because blockchain really should be the perfect space for inclusivity and diversity to thrive. The underlying spirit of the technology lies in opposition to rigid or standard systems put in place by conventional finance companies or the internet’s data monopolies. Blockchain is meant to oppose the normative expectations of society.The technology requires that people come together and use it collaboratively. People who are accustomed to owning their data and keeping it in a cloud database are now working on one shared ledger. It’s collaborative. Diverse.Reach Out And See What HappensMy recommendation to be a part of increasing diversity is to get involved. It may seem intimidating, but the community is very welcoming. Reach out to people that you admire on Twitter or LinkedIn. If you read an article and think that the author has a great perspective, get in touch with them. Sign up for Coinbase and educate yourself. Or better yet, invest a small amount and get your hands dirty.Seriously, people will give you the time of day. They’ll connect you to the right people or help you find support. Reach out, get involved, and see what happens. I know that it can seem daunting to enter an industry that appears to be dominated by one group. But we need people to make that leap and show everyone else that diversity truly has a place in blockchain.This question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.

the ...","Jan 24, 2018,03:54pm EST",This article appeared in Forbes Israel,"2017 has turned out to be an especially bloody year. Over the course of the year, eight huge terror attacks were executed, each with more than a 100 fatalities. Six of the eight deadliest attacks claimed the lives of nearly 1,500 people this year in Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Egypt and Somalia – planned, financed and carried out by the Taliban, ISIS or Al-Qaeda. According to the Global Terrorism Database of the University of Maryland, in 2016, these organizations were responsible for approximately 70% of the world’s terror victims.It is no coincidence that the deadliest terror organizations in the world are also the wealthiest. “There is a clear connection between the two factors,” agrees Maj.-Gen. (Res.) Amos Gilad, chairperson of the Institute for Policy and Strategy and former director of the Defense Ministry’s Political-Military Affairs Bureau, in an interview for Forbes Israel. “The financial component of terror organizations is critical, and its indispensability for terror attacks is like fuel for the car,” he adds.As such, financial means are an essential necessity for terrorist organizations. But means of fundraising are inherently limited and are conducted primarily through underground channels, outside of and above the law in the global shadow economy. In many cases, the nature of fundraising activity is remarkably similar to that of criminal organizations – dealing in drugs, weapons, tobacco or humans, through bank robbery or collecting money in the name of “protection” and even kidnapping for ransom.Alongside the clearly criminal activity, there is also open activity in which enormous sums of money change hands among funding bodies and terror organizations. This fundraising involves associations, charitable organizations, companies in business, finance bodies, wealthy businessmen – and as it would seem in recent years – governments and states of means.“Behind every successful terrorist organization stands a financial system and in many cases, it's a country,” declared the head of IDF Intelligence, Major General Herzi Halevi. “In our region, Iran is the primary funder of terror organizations.” And, indeed, in a comparison of the estimated income of the richest terror groups that we conducted three years ago, one of the salient trends emerging from the findings is the significant strengthening of those terror organizations supported by assisting countries (Hizballah, Hamas, the Islamic Jihad) and the weakening of those that depend on independent sources (ISIS, Boko Haram).Iran, one of the four countries defined by the US State Department as a terrorist country (along with Sudan, Syria and the newcomer North-Korea), is the main sponsor and force behind many terrorist organizations. Its centrality in the balancing of economic (and militant) forces of terror organizations in the Middle East has become critical as compared to previous years, and its importance in terror groups’ internal systems of considerations has become crucial.All of this is possible on account of Iran’s being rescued from the financial quicksand in which it was sinking until not long ago. “The signing of the nuclear agreement and lifting of the sanctions was the removal of the rope around the Iranians’ neck,” asserted Major General (Res.) Amos Gilad. “It actually saved them from economic strangulation.”Using Bitcoin to Avoid RisksThe involvement of other countries in the region, particularly those of the Persian Gulf, played a central role in the terror arena in recent years. Those countries constitute an important pillar in the financing of terror in the region, whether indirectly, by turning a blind eye to financial transgressions of private entities in the country, or by paying ransom for the release of abducted citizens.Sometimes, as happened recently, the funding streams intersect – and the boundaries between aid money that flows to terror organizations from particular countries and ransom payments are blurred almost entirely. As part of the condition of the ransom transaction for the release of 26 members of the Qatari royal family who were abducted in Iraq by a local Shiite militia, supported by Iran, Qatar was “forced” to pay an imaginary ransom which, according to an exposé by the Financial Times was around a billion dollars. The unprecedented payment that financed some of the deadliest terror organizations in Syria and Iraq (and Iran itself), was seen by many as direct support of terror by the provocative princedom of oil and led to the famous boycott imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain.And in addition to “traditional” means of funding, terrorist organizations are always perfecting their ways of raising and transferring capital from a variety of funding sources, through use of any technological means at their disposal. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the FBI had exposed an international network run by ISIS that used fake eBay and PayPal accounts to transfer funds to operatives in the US. For some time now Google and Youtube have become the preferred platform of terror organizations for sharing propaganda videos which, thanks to their popularity, has granted them not just exposure and penetration into new audiences, but also generous royalties from advertisers. Sometimes the terrorist groups use the most advanced methods, such as the money transfer system built by IS that uses cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin in order to avoid traditional bank transfers and accompanying risk.The rapid growth in recent years of trade in virtual currencies, which uses an alternative global financial system and is characterized by user anonymity, grants terror factions many new and secure possibilities for raising, laundering and transferring money – as proven by the arrest of the 27 year-old Long Island woman, who has been accused of stealing and laundering more than $85,000, using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to support ISIS.""Things have changed considerably in our century"", argues Joseph Fitsanakis PhD., a global expert in intelligence and national security from Coastal Carolina University. ""It can be argued that the rise in the value of many cryptocurrencies generates income for terrorist organizations— but more a method of circulating currency and providing services that generate funds. With the use of cryptocurrencies and the so-called Darknet, terrorist organizations are now able to engage in creative means of generating cash. They include the sale of pirated music, movies, and video-games, counterfeit products, including clothing, electronics, pharmaceutical products and even counterfeit tickets to high-profile sports events and music concerts. Those who buy those products often pay for them using cryptocurrencies, primarily through the Darknet"".Children hold portraits of Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah (C) and Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah... [+] Ali Khamenei in the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh on October 4, 2017. / Mahmout Zayyat/AFP/GettyThe Top 10 ListHere is a list of some of the world’s wealthiest – and most dangerous – terrorist organizations and how they make their money. The list was created based on interviews with security experts and counter-terror specialists, as well as reports and analysis from international NGOs, academic and government organizations, and think-tanks. It brings to light estimated numbers behind the top ten wealthiest terrorist organizations from the State Department list of Designated Foreign Terrorist organizations.We put together the first ranking three years ago., and the material accrued since then has enabled us to create a reliable and qualitative update of income estimates of terror organizations. But apart from examining the financial means at the disposal of today’s terror groups and the ways in which each organization finances its operations, the current research allows a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the way in which these organizations operate: what trends characterize the activities of terror groups, how the map of their interests has changed, who are the financiers behind them and how has the balance of power in the global terror arena changed in recent years.#1 HizballahTotal annual Income – $1.1 billionOther than the Iranian Government, there is no doubt who is the primary beneficiary of the nuclear agreement. Within a few years, Hizballah’s budget jumped significantly with the government expenditure out of Tehran, and if in the past they received about $200 million per year, today the Iranian funding of the Lebanese terror group, according to estimates by the security establishment, is evaluated at more than $800 million dollars annually.But despite the large sums of money flowing from Tehran, the extremist Shiite organization did not always enjoy such wide financial support and there were times in the not-too-distant past in which, as a result of urgent liquidity problems, they made do with just hundreds of millions. Because of this, Hizballah made sure to vary its sources of capital; from raising money and support collected by organizations camouflaged as charities and scattered all over the world, down to real estate dealings and “used car” dealerships run by private business people.The crowning glory of Hizballah’s business portfolio is its hold on the global drug industry. The organization’s worldwide crime operation extends from South America, through Africa, Europe, the Far East, Australia and the Middle East. Among their various activities, there are active Hizballah cells engaged in constant money laundering, forgery, weapons trade, smuggling, and of course producing and trading drugs, primarily heroin and cocaine.Despite sweeping denial by the leaders of the religious extremist organization, officials from the American Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have in the past presented conclusive evidence linking the drug organizations active at the Triple Frontier (Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay) with extremist Muslim organizations and Hizballah in particular. Its involvement in the drug industry of South America began in the early 1980s and has gained significant momentum over the last decade; through use of the large Shiite-Lebanese diaspora and close collaboration with South American cartels and drug organizations as well as crime and terror organizations in North Africa, a global-narcotic network has been created, netting billions of dollars a year. Among those enjoying the spoils is Hizballah. Today the total income generated by the organization’s global-narcotic operations comes to hundreds of millions of dollars yearly.#2 – The TalibanTotal annual income: $800 millionUnfortunately, the Taliban’s success in recent years can also be measured financially. The Taliban runs a financial mechanism similar to that of ISIS (until recently) – the broader the territory they seize and the greater the population under their control, the more resources and potential revenue streams they have to convert into huge sums of money. The Taliban’s primary source of income today, as much as hundreds of millions of dollars each year, comes from the production and trade of drugs (mainly growing opium and manufacturing heroin). After that (in order of decreasing importance) the organization makes hundreds of millions from the pirate mining of natural resources within the regions under its control, collecting ransom for hostages and, finally, from donations.As mentioned, the foremost source of capital for the Jihadist organization relies on the extensive narcotic network built and refined over the years. This made Afghanistan into the biggest heroin production and growing operation in the world and the reason why more areas in Afghanistan are used for growing opium than there are areas in Latin America for growing coca. This network is responsible for one of the most essential arteries of the global drug industry, yielding hundreds of millions of dollars a year. According to the '2017 World Drug Report' of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Afghanistan is the largest producer and exporter of opium in the world and is responsible for the production of approximately 90% of the world’s heroin. In total, more than 400 tons of heroin are produced in Afghanistan each year and the net value of opium exports alone constitutes around 12% of the country’s GDP. A report presented to the UN’s Security Council states that roughly 3 million Afghani people today are directly or indirectly employed by the drug industry. This is mind-boggling, as the country’s entire workforce is approximately 8 million people, according to the CIA.As much as this sounds like a huge sum, this is only half of the total income produced by the Taliban. An important additional piece in their rich and varied financial system is their pirate mining of minerals, namely copper and iron. A further significant source of income for the organization comes from donations, mostly from wealthy Saudi sheikhs and philanthropists. According to a study conducted by the New York Times, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is among the group's heavy funders of the group. Although the government in Riyadh officially supports the Afghani government and the American task force in the country, Saudi authorities in practice turn a blind eye to the increasing sums of money flowing from the private accounts of the wealthy.#3 – HamasTotal annual income: $700 millionLast June marked tenth anniversary of the Hamas movement’s control over the people of Gaza. Looking back, it seems there is no cause to celebrate. A special report recently published by the UN allowed a glimpse into the intolerable life in Gaza under the mismanagement of Hamas and points to a dizzyingly escalating humanitarian crisis. According to a summary in the UN report, the Gaza Strip will be unlivable by 2020 if the current situation persists.The security intensification that came with Hamas' seizure of rule over Gaza brought with it immediate economic mayhem. A stream of more than 100,000 workers that entered Israel daily, and provided livelihood for hundreds of thousands of people in the Gaza strip, has almost entirely stopped. According to the World Bank, the current rate of unemployment in Gaza is the highest in the world and stands at over 40%. Among youth, the rate rises above 60%. The average income in Gaza is $1,800 per capita, among the lowest in the world. Electrical infrastructure and the factories that were destroyed in fighting, as well as the gross lack of raw materials (those that are not redirected by the heads of the organization to rebuilding tunnels), has paralyzed industry, which currently amounts to furniture production, cultivation of tomatoes and fishing.But despite the catastrophic situation of Gaza, Hamas is managing to generate numerous funding sources from the impoverished population there, bringing in tens of millions of dollars each month. The sophisticated and elaborate tax network redirects significant capital flowing into Gaza as aid. This, for instance, is how Hamas collects taxes on the money-changing companies that convert the foreign currency to shekels, pocketing tens of millions on the way. In addition, Hamas runs hundreds of businesses monopolizing a variety of fields from real estate to security, banking, and even hotels and tourism.Along with taxes, hundreds of millions of dollars flow in to the organization’s account each year as private donations from business owners or various societies from all over the world. The biggest current funder of Hamas is, not surprisingly, Iran which, along with Qatar has committed to contributing large sums of money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In order to ensure that not all the money goes to the rehabilitation of Gaza and improving its residents’ welfare, the regime in Tehran has specifically allocated a significant sum from its contribution to support Hamas and its military arm’s activities. According to security sources, this allowance is 70 million dollars a year, and is responsible for nearly half of the military wing’s estimated budget of 150 million dollars.#4 – Al-QaedaTotal annual income: $300 millionUnder the organization’s fundamentalist umbrella are some of the deadliest organizations operating today. According to the US State Department Country Reports on Terrorism a number of the primary branches include: Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Libya, Algeria, Ivory Coast, Mali, Nigeria, Tunisia and Burkina Faso), Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (Yemn and Saudi Arabia), Al-Qaeda in the Indian Peninsula (India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), al-Shabaab (Somaia) and Tahrir al-Sham (Syria).Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb is mainly active in Central and Western Africa and exploits the region’s instability and the penetrable borders of the countries in which its operations are based. It currently deals in the illegal trade of drugs, weapons, automobiles and people – and recently in the increasingly profitable branch of illegal trade in cigarettes and tobacco. A special report by the KPMG firm estimated that the illegal cigarette market in the countries of the Maghreb in 2016 constituted tax losses of about 565 million dollars. The scope of the illegal tobacco trade in North Africa currently stands at more than a billion dollars annually, and according to the UN comes out to about 60 billion black market cigarettes annually, of which a significant portion flows directly to the criminal and terrorist organizations controlling the region. Kidnapping for ransom payments also constitute a large source of income for the group, bringing in additional millions of dollars annually.Like its brother in the West, Al-Qaeda of the Arab Peninsula takes great advantage of the local instability and local support, particularly in Yemen, to occupy territories, consolidate its hold in the region and so produce sizable income streams. Two years ago, for instance, the organization succeeded in taking over Mukalla, an important central port city in Yemen. Their control of the city, held until April 2016, generated about 2 million dollars a day for the organization from collecting protection fees and taxes, as well as pocketing an additional 20 million dollars from plundering local banks – according to a special report of the UN Security Council. In addition, Al-Qaeda of the Arab Peninsula continues to create ongoing revenue streams from kidnapping and ransom payments, as well as donations from charities of wealthy notables, primarily from the Gulf StatesJabhat al-Nusra, Tahrir al-Sham in its current incarnation, is Al-Qaeda’s proxy in Syria. The extremist Sunni organization’s income comes primarily from ransom payments and generous donations from the wealthy Sunni Gulf states. This year the organization wrangled a hefty sum of money for the provocative transaction in which it released Qatari royalty in exchange for the unprecedented sum of an estimated $130 million, according to the Financial Times.A relatively new organization in Al-Qaeda’s portfolio, but a veteran of Africa’s bloody terror arena, is al-Shabaab, the Somalian terror group.. Like the rest of Al-Qaeda’s destructive affiliates, al-Shabaab also obtains its own funding. According to a UN report, the organization raises funds mostly through taxing the inhabitants of the territories under its control. Additional funding comes from pirate mining and illegal coal trade as well as kidnapping and ransom payments – all of which make tens of millions of dollars per year for the terror organization.#5 – ISISTotal annual income: $200 millionAs of now with the fall of the town Rawa, the organization has lost its last urban stronghold in Iraq and those who controlled a third of the country have been almost entirely eliminated. Getting rid of any remnants of their control is just a matter of time and considering the great power they held until not long ago, this is a remarkable collapse. At its peak towards the end of 2014, the Islamic State extended over 100,000 square kilometers – larger than South Korea – and subjected 10 million people to its oppressive rule at the height of its power.The vast lands that the organization captured during its rapid conquests throughout 2014 and the millions of people subjugated to its cruel rule made up the source of its wealth in its heyday. ISIS controlled oil and gas fields, rich mineral deposits, fertile agricultural lands, factories, weapons and of course millions of people underpinning the organization’s finances, primarily through paying the organization taxes and ‘protection’ fees. Three years ago, precisely at the height of ISIS’ military and political power, its annual income stood at around 3 billion dollars. In an unprecedented, comprehensive study published by Forbes Israel, ranking the 10 richest terror organizations in the world, ISIS was rated as the richest terror organization in the world; indeed, the richest in the history of terror.The basis for its speedy money-making (as with many similar examples in the Middle East) came, unsurprisingly, from one major factor – oil. But this source of quick income soon became ISIS point of weakness. The intensification of the fighting against them and the grueling daily battles on the ground eventually led to the loss of extensive territory, including loss of control over fields of oil, gas, and precious mineral deposits. The organization suffered massive air raids by the coalition forces (attacks deliberately focused on the oil reserves) which added further strain and ultimately brought about the dwindling of profits from the organization’s primary source of income. Soon afterwards, what's more, the price of oil collapsed, plunging from 110$ per barrel at the beginning of 2014, to less than 30$ per barrel in 2016, further slashing the organization’s profits.Income from oil and gas, which constituted the main source of ISIS’ wealth, was not the sole source of capital in its financial system. Taxes, ransom, protection fees and robberies of banks and antiquities became important components of wealth accumulation. As the only governmental authority in villages and towns under its rule, ISIS collected taxes and protection fees from the occupied population. But loss of control of the population it controlled until recently naturally brought about a drop in this source of income.Apart from the large energy reserves that they controlled and the coercive mechanism for collecting protection, ransom and taxes for their own profit – ISIS also conquered vast agricultural lands, factories, power stations, dams, and other strategic facilities – which added greatly to their power and economic strength. In addition, the organization held vast territory in the 5 most fertile agricultural districts in Iraq that control about 40% of the wheat crop and various types of grain grown in the country, which in total, according to estimates by agricultural experts, amounted to 30% of the local agricultural market under ISIS’ control. All of this was lost when the organization withdrew from the large areas that it held.According to estimates, the deadly terror organization lost over 90% of its income in the last three years alone, from about 2-3 billion dollars in 2014 to only 200 million dollars in 2017. In the coming year, ISIS will return to its original financial standing, and will be supported again primarily by ransom payments, donations, and external aid to finance its guerrilla activities in Syria and Iraq.#6 – PKK – Kurdistan Workers’ PartyTotal annual income: $180 millionAccording to the US State Department’s annual terrorism report, the PKK has many and varied sources of capital and relies heavily on the widespread Kurdish diaspora across Europe for funding its operations. According to estimates, the money flowing into the organization ranges between $50 to $100 million annually.The primary source of PKK’s income stems, unsurprisingly and similarly to other terror groups, from the drug trade – namely heroin and cannabis. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), has estimated that the organization makes about $75 million annually from heroin. In the past, British intelligence estimated that the PKK is responsible for 40% of the heroin smuggled into the European Union, with the US Treasury also noting its significance in the global drug industry.Another important dimension of the PKK’s illegal business transactions is human trafficking, as well as pirating of tobacco and cigarettes, according to a special report by a NATO intelligence branch. From the illegal migration from Asian and African countries and smuggling people and illegal substances into European countries, the organization is making millions of dollars each year.Apart from its criminal money-making activities, the PKK also runs a legitimate and legal network for raising funds and aid money from its many supporters. The PKK’s European arm runs hundreds of aid organizations for increasing propaganda and collecting donations and solidarity tax from among the Kurdish community, particularly in Germany. A special report published by Germany’s domestic intelligence service (the BfV), has estimated that funds flowing into the organization from donations come to about 30 million dollars annually, about half of which is collected from the Kurdish community in Germany.#7 – Kata’ib HizballahTotal annual income: $150 millionPractically since its inception, the organization has been heavily funded by its Iranian patron, which makes sure to devote money and resources for the organization’s activities. More can be learned from a lawsuit filed against European banks by American veterans and the families of soldiers killed in Iraq. According to the statement submitted against the banking powers, HSBC, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Standard Chartered and the Royal Bank of Scotland channeled money from Tehran to the terror organization in Iraq. These funds allegedly were transferred directly from Iran to Kata’ib Hizballah in order to finance shootings and roadside bombings in which dozens of American soldiers were killed or wounded. The claim explicitly implicates Kata’ib Hizballah as one of the main recipients of those funds which, according to the pleadings, came to over 100 million dollars.An additional source of income comes from abductions and ransom payments, which in the last year brought huge sums into the Shiite terror organization’s account. Kata’ib Hizballah was the organization that headed the plan and execution of the abductions of 26 members of the Qatari royal family while they were on a falcon hunting expedition in December 2015. The dubious release transaction saw the royal family transfer the astronomical sum of a billion dollars to Iran and other terror organizations (which triggered the big boycott against Qatar by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain), and the Shiite organization is estimated to have received an especially hefty cut of the spoils. According to the Financial Times which exposed the details of the transaction, suitcases loaded with cash amounting to about 700 million dollars were transferred to Iran and its ‘partners’ in exchange for the hostages’ release.#8 – Palestinian Islamic JihadTotal annual income: $100 millionUp to 2 years ago, the Islamic Jihad was facing a severe economic crisis, as one of their senior officials expressed it “the most severe economic crisis in the history of the organization,” which was founded in 1979 as a branch of the Egyptian Islamic Brotherhood movement. The Jihadi organization’s sources of funding had dried up and its pockets emptied. In a political crisis with their Iranian patron, close ally and nearly exclusive sponsor, the latter threatened to cut the oxygen flow to the Jihadist organization - brought the Islamic Jihad to the brink of bankruptcy and to its lowest point in its many years of activity.At that time the coalition forces of the region’s Sunni states (led by Saudi Arabia, Iran’s Sunni rival), began a large-scale military operation against the Houthis in Yemen. While the heads of the Islamic Jihad were determined to remain neutral, the Iranians demanded explicit support for the Shiite Houthis. When expression of support was not forthcoming, Tehran decided on a drastic cut in funding for the organization, which went into a violent tailspin.Eventually, the Islamic Jihad leaders gave in and surrendered to the dictates of Tehran, including a public “declaration of loyalty”. A delegation of senior officials headed by Ramadan Shalah, secretary general of the organization, was dispatched to end the tensions and to consult the Revolutionary Guard. During the meeting, Shalah thanked Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force (the elite unit of the Revolutionary Guard), for the ‘exclusive’ support of the Palestinian intifada. In what was described as a sweeping declaration of loyalty by the Islamic Jihad to Iran and unconditional acceptance of its demands, the organization’s secretary general criticized the ‘other Arab states’ that did not support the Palestinian uprising and declared that “Iran is the only country that supports the intifada and the families of the martyrs.”Unsurprisingly, the reward soon followed. Soon after the meeting, the heads of the organization received an offer of reconciliation in the form of tens of millions of dollars. It is estimated that Islamic Jihad receives support from Iran of about $70 million a year and that Iran alone is responsible for supplying nearly 75% of the Palestinian terror organization’s entire budget.#9 – Lashkar-e-TaibaTotal annual income: $75 millionAccording to the US State Department, the Lashkar-e-Taiba organization relies heavily on the Pakistani diaspora (with most capital flowing in from communities based in the Gulf States and Britain), and aid funding from business people, Kashmiri tycoons and Indian mafia. Additionally, many millions are funneled into funds and charities that operate under the organization’s aid arm, which they use to garner support and sympathy from among the local population.Lashkar-e-Taiba maintains training camps for its fighters, along with schools, daycare centers, welfare institutions and clinics all over Pakistan and is active in Afghanistan as well. Most of the fundraising to the charity and welfare funds (in which, as usual, nobody knows where the line lies between funding charity and terror) is done publicly, through extensive publicity campaigns in the Pakistani media. In addition, according to some estimates, the Pakistani terror organization continues to receive generous financial support from Pakistani officials.#10 – The Real IRATotal annual income: $50 millionDespite the efforts of customs authorities and security forces, the organization’s leaders have refined their fundraising abilities and manage to pocket tens of millions of dollars per year, mostly through a sophisticated global network that smuggles and sells cigarettes and tobacco. The tobacco smuggling industry in Britain has been thriving in recent years, bringing in huge sums of money.A special report produced by the international accounting firm KPMG suggests that the illegal cigarette trade on the black market in Britain is among the largest in Europe. In 2016, approximately 5.55 billion cigarettes were sold illegally – with a black-market value of around $1.1 billion annually. In a special investigation done by the Sun, senior government officials declared that IRA members (including the Provisional IRA) are responsible for about 40% of the illegal tobacco market in Britain, and with the profits generated by this industry annually, tens of millions of dollars in royalties go directly to the RIRA.The crime and terror organization recently got an unexpected boost from parliament – thanks to the same law that forbids the branding of packets of cigarettes and rolling tobacco. According to experts, the passing of the law significantly simplified the forgery work required of those profiting from black market tobacco and is expected to channel tens of millions of dollars more their way with a hefty portion expected to go to the RIRA.Apart from illegal trade in tobacco, the radical Irish organization also enjoys significant royalties from its pirate network of falsified alcohol and fuel products as well as protection fees that it collects – especially in those areas under its influence, in which police enforcement is low.An additional source of capital for the Real IRA, according to the US State Department Report on Global Terror, comes from supporters in the large Irish community in the USA. The underground Irish organization knows well how to exploit this wealthy target audience, and raises funds based on the support of Irish-American activists who oppose the peace agreement."

is very much a moving target, it doesn't in any reasonable way fulfill the 
role ...","Jan 21, 2018,09:00am EST","Near the end of his enlightening, myth-slaying and brilliant new book, Gold: The Final Standard, Nathan Lewis writes that “hardly anything is created without combining goods, services, labor and capital from all over the world.” His simple statement says it all, and is a good jumping off point for a review of his essential history of quality money.","In writing about the global cooperation required for the creation of goods and services, Lewis was making a much bigger point about money: it’s best when it’s least evident.  Money is not wealth; rather money is an agreement about value that facilitates the exchange of wealth.When the value of money is unchanging, we’re much more capable of trading without fear of being on the losing end of what is, by its very name, mutually enhancing.  Applying all of this to the quote from Lewis that begins this review, stable money is crucial because in facilitating trade, it’s propelling our individual specialization.  And when we’re able to pursue the work in which we specialize, we’re much more productive.Lewis’s conclusion in the final chapter of Gold is that “The free market economy has, inherent within it, the assumption that money is stable in value.” Lewis would say he’s merely stating the obvious much as Adam Smith was when he wrote in The Wealth of Nations that the “sole use of money is to circulate consumable goods,” but the world has sadly changed.  While economists, politicians and pundits pay lip service to the genius of free trade to varying to degrees, they betray their limited understanding of it with their almost monolithic disdain for, or ignorance about, stable money.  Money that holds its value is what once again enables the feverish trade that allows us to specialize.If anyone doubts this, imagine earning $100/week that some weeks buys 100 gallons of gasoline, but only 20 gallons in others.  Or imagine if you were paid in Bitcoin that, when 2017 began, sold for $800/coin, only for one coin to command as much as $19,500 by early 2018.  If someone offered to pay you in Bitcoin or dollars this volatile, you’d logically ask which dollar and which Bitcoin.  Would you readily buy goods and services in early 2018 in Bitcoin, invest with it, or donate in terms of it? It would be a difficult call.  Depending on the cryptocurrency’s direction you would either make out very well, or take a bath.  The instability of the measure would likely limit your transactions.Bitcoin’s extraordinary volatility instructs.  Precisely because its value is very much a moving target, it doesn’t in any reasonable way fulfill the role of “money.” The latter once again facilitates exchange, but Bitcoin’s volatility renders it a very dangerous coin to exchange or invest with.  The chances to lose, and lose BIG, are too great.Taking this back to the dollar, if its volatility had been as a great as Bitcoin’s since the nation’s founding, wealth in the U.S. would be a fraction of its present self.  It would be because our currency would have rendered trade a fool’s errand.  The lack of trade and investment would have long ago stopped us in our tracks.  We would have stagnated; that, or a replacement for a dollar defined by maddening instability would have revealed itself long ago.All this is a long way of saying that Lewis’s point about stable money being central to a free market system cannot be stressed enough.  We produce so that we can get what we don’t have.  Our ability to “import” goods from across the street and from the other side of the world is what frees us to pursue that which most elevates our talents.  Stable money makes this possible simply because it most enables the trade of wealth for wealth.  The agreement about value is what fosters the exchange of real wealth, and by extension the specialization that long ago freed us from a daily – and often fruitless – search for food.  Thank goodness for varied skills around the world, and for open trading lanes lubricated by money so that we can exchange what most amplifies our talents for that of others doing the same.Money is at the center of all this.  And as Lewis crucially points out in the book’s early chapters, producers have been defining money with stability top of mind for thousands of years.  Well, of course they have.  That which is created to foster trade is going to be stable in value.The creators of good money from thousands of years ago would marvel at the floating currencies of today.  Why would what Lewis describes as a “universal medium of trade, a unit of account, and a standard of value” bounce around in terms of value? The very notion is self-defeating in much the same way that there would be immense chaos in kitchens if the minute, cup, and tablespoon had no fixed definition.  To “float” all three would be the equivalent of placing a blindfold on chefs.  For them to mitigate the noise wrought by floating minutes, cups and tablespoons, chefs would be forced to hire mathematicians to endlessly calculate the changes. All three are supposed to be quiet, low-entropy (George Gilder) measures in the way that money should be.All of the above helps vivify Lewis’s crucial point about fixed exchange rates delivering such “obvious advantage.” Well, of course they do.  When currencies float, it’s the equivalent of placing blindfolds on the world’s economic actors.  It is because money is once again a measure.  Goods and services float in value to reflect consumer preference, scarcity, abundance, enhanced production techniques, obsolescence, and seemingly everything else.  “Money” is simply the unbiased observer; the truth-teller as it were.  And when it floats, the truth is obscured.  Lewis’s book makes a wonderful case for returning money to its sole purpose as a quiet yardstick meant to enhance the exchange that relentlessly improves us.Getting into specifics, Lewis seeks a return to gold-defined money.  He does for the simple reason that commodities like it “are among the least influenced by any of the causes that produce fluctuations in value.” (John Stuart Mill).  Useful here is that Lewis isn’t closed-minded to non-gold measures for money so long as they can trump the yellow metal when it comes to stability.  The latter is remarkable.Lewis cites countless examples, but the California one is maybe the best.  The discovery of gold in northern California in 1848 naturally sparked a rush of fortune hunters to the west.  Lewis writes that as a result of the California discoveries, global “production reached a peak of 227 tons in 1855, over thirteen times the 1830 level.” Lewis notes that the “quantities were unimaginable” in terms of new supply, but at the same time they logically had no real impact on the price of the commodity.  Indeed, as Lewis goes on to reveal, the “227 tons mined in 1855 was only 1.3%” of all the gold that existed in the world.It’s the metal’s stock/flow disparity that renders its price so stable, and that explains why it’s been accepted as money for so long.  When gold’s value moves up or down it’s the dollar’s value moving up or down, not the value of gold.  It’s the proverbial anchor. Per Mill, its price is “least influenced” by that which causes fluctuations in value.  All of this is a reminder of why the occasional calls by stable-money advocates for oil, aluminum, and “baskets of commodity” standards make so little sense.  Lewis could explain why in his sleep, but for those wondering, he writes that “For most commodities, annual production and ‘supply’ are nearly synonymous.” That there’s very little stock/flow disparity among non-gold commodities disqualifies them as definers of money given the simple truth that the lack of disparity ensures volatility of the measure.Lewis is arguably more knowledgeable about money and its history than anyone alive today.  And while he’s been writing columns and books for years on the subject, Gold is the first one that really provides a thorough, 5,000-year history.Lewis devotes a few chapters to the long history for a reason: it’s to show that 1971 to the present is the real monetary outlier.  When President Nixon delinked the dollar from its golden anchor in 1971, “For the first time in 5,000 years, going back in an unbroken line to the Sumerians and Egyptians of the third millennium B.C., the leading money of the world was not based on gold or silver.  It was not based on anything at all.”What’s more than impressive is that Lewis has detailed information about the various monetary regimes that came up over the millennia.  Curious about money during China’s Tang Dynasty from 618-907? Lewis will explain.  It turns out that in addition to gold and silver, there was also a “high-quality bronze coin – regulations specified 83% copper, 15% lead and 2% tin” that was used for everyday transactions.  Readers will marvel at Lewis’s research.What’s important about all of it is that it’s once again a reminder of how far off track – at least monetarily – the world has traveled.  This isn’t to say that progress has ceased, but it is to say that stable money has the potential to author amazing progress for it once again facilitating the trade and investment without which there can be none.  The problem is that since 1971 currencies have had very little definition. This has resulted in $5.1 trillion in daily currency trading, endless hedging of currency risk, voluminous investment in wealth that already exists as a currency hedge, and yes, an explosion of hedge funds eager to profit from the equivalent of forcing chefs to work in kitchens with blindfolds on.It quite simply cannot be repeated enough that money is the low-entropy measure that provides crucial information when its value is uniform.  That economists have almost unanimously fallen for the trade, specialization, investment and truth-wrecking falsehood that is floating money will certainly be exhibit B (Exhibit A being the almost universal belief among Econ. Ph.Ds that WWII ended the Great Depression) in future museums devoted to happily defunct professions.For now, it’s scary to contemplate how much progress we’ve not achieved since 1971 thanks to a rather weak imitation of money having rendered trade and investment so much more perilous.  The latter of course ignores the incalculable loss of human capital to professions meant to trade the chaos.  About this, currency traders and hedge funds are a logical consequence of floating money.  To bemoan their proliferation is the equivalent of yelling at the scoreboard for it confirming your team’s lack of skill.  Traders and hedge funds are the symptom of the floating money problem.  If people ever ask you the reader why you’re for good money, just say that you love progress.  We’ve missed out on copious amounts of it since 1971.Droll is probably not the adjective to attach to Lewis’s writing, but it certainly has a wink-and-nod quality to it.  As this expert of money experts takes the reader through a history of money, he calmly slays many myths along the way.  For the myths exposed alone, Lewis is a treat.Keynesians naturally believe that government spending is a driver of economic growth, and that a substantial pullback in spending slows output.  Never explained by these believers in wealth that drops from the sky is how, other than through private sector growth, that governments attain the means to be falsely generous in the first place.  Similarly never explained is why Paul Ryan and Nancy Pelosi would be better allocators of precious resources than would be Jeff Bezos and Fred Smith.  Why, if total government control over the economy has a 100% record of failure, would sound minds hand even partial control over to the same individuals who fail every time when they’re the sole driver? It’s never answered, but in Lewis’s case he just calmly points out that in the aftermath of WWII, federal spending fell from $93 billion in 1945 to $34 billion in 1947.  Recession? No, and for obvious reasons.  Resources never lay idle.  The difference after 1945 was that market actors allocated what was precious over politicians.Economists are almost uniformly wedded to the notion that economic growth has a downside: rising prices.  Except that such a belief is almost totally backwards.  As Lewis notes, the original Ford Model T set buyers back $850 in 1908.  By 1925, when the U.S. economy was raging, consumers could walk away with a new one for $260.  Missed by demand-side economists is that economic growth is an effect of production.  If we’re demanding, it means we’re supplying.  The supply comes before the demand.  Logically.  Furthermore, the production that signals economic growth is a happy consequence of investment that is always and everywhere geared toward getting more production in return for fewer costs.  Yes, investment and trade are about enhancing productivity that naturally brings down the cost of everything.  Along these lines, Lewis points out that production of refrigerators soared from 5,000 in 1921 to 1 million in 1930.  Economic growth is the greatest enemy rising prices have ever known.About the Great Depression, it’s accepted wisdom among economists that the Federal Reserve caused it.  Supposedly it kept credit tight; something that on its own is an impossibility.  When we borrow dollars we’re borrowing access to real resources.  The notion that some central bank could restrain the exchange of resources always and everywhere created in the private sector defies basic common sense.  But I digress.Lewis’s main point is that while economists to this day decry excessive inactivity on the part of the Fed in the 30s, the incorrectly criticized inactivity was by design.  As he explains it, the Fed was supposed to “wait years, even decades” to do anything at all.  He writes that “In a crisis, it [the Fed] would make short-term loans at a penalty interest rate” to solvent banks, but as he goes on to tell us, “overnight lending rates between solvent banks remained low, indicating that there was no systemwide shortage.” As for the popular view associated with Milton Friedman that the Fed contracted the “money supply,” Lewis shows the opposite to be true.  That the Fed couldn’t control the “money supply” in the first place is another discussion for another review.Important here is that love or hate the Fed, it did what it was supposed to do in the 30s.  In discrediting the laughable view that the Fed was the source of the Great Depression, Lewis calmly discredits Friedman and Murray Rothbard.  He notes that “both focused on monetary explanations for the Great Depression,” both “relied heavily on fallacious ‘quantity theory’” theories to make their arguments, yet Lewis confidently eviscerates them.  As he stresses, the dollar had a gold definition then.  End of story.  Notable here is that neither Friedman nor Rothbard ever contended that the value of gold changed during the period in which they were trying to draw a monetary picture to explain an economic downturn created in Washington.  As such, each was forced to pervert the historical definitions of inflation and deflation in their vain attempts to blame the Fed for the sins of Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, and Congress.The gold standard didn't restrain the economy in the 1930s simply because such a system is all about maintaining the integrity of the unit itself. The better question to ask is how much worse the 30s downturn would have been had the dollar been set afloat.  Thankfully it wasn’t.  On the other hand, FDR did devalue it from $20.67 to $35 in 1933.  What a chilling message to send to investors whose capital commitments were a purchase of future dollar income streams.  Important about FDR’s decision is that the Fed had nothing to do with it.  Fed Chair Eugene Meyer actually resigned over FDR’s decision. There were monetary drivers of the Great Depression, but they had nothing to do with the Fed.In navigating toward a conclusion, it’s useful to point out another myth promoted by gold-standard opponents.  They say adherence to a dollar price rule limits the supply of dollars.  What a laugh.  Simple logic dictates the opposite scenario.  Indeed, good money once again facilitates the very trade that enables productivity-boosting specialization.  Production is an expression of wants.  We produce for “money,” but we’re really expressing our desire for all that money can be exchanged for.  Applied to a gold-standard system, the very stability that the latter embodies is a signal that under such a system the supply of money is going to soar to match all the production. And so it did.Getting into specifics, Lewis shows early on in Gold how the supply of dollars in 1900 was 163 times greater than it was in 1775.  Despite this stupendous surge, “the value of the dollar was the same: $20.67/ounce of gold.”  Something similar took place in England with the pound.  Yet it’s Lewis’s methodical discredit of the notion that gold-standard systems limit so-called “money supply” that brings up my main quibble with a book that is brilliant.Lewis describes a monetary authority’s operation of a gold-standard system as one that’s fairly basic.  As he puts it, “the monetary base expands when the currency is rising above its value parity (gold or another currency), and contracts when the currency is sagging beneath is value parity.” Explicit in Lewis’s reasoning is that a fixed value can be maintained through supply and demand management.  This didn’t ring true.Figure that the prices of equities aren’t a supply/demand phenomenon.  In truth, the value of a business is the market’s projection of all the money it will make in the future.  Supply/demand has little to do with equity valuations, and the same applies to currencies.  Currency valuations don’t spring from expert “adjustments of the monetary base” as much as they’re similarly an expression about the future.  They’re a comment on the monetary standard, a lack of a standard, or a future lack of a standard.Looking at the U.S., we didn’t even have a central bank until 1913, yet as Lewis notes the dollar largely held its value.  The standard whereby the dollar was defined as roughly 1/20th of an ounce of gold is what counted, not some theoretical management of the dollar’s supply.  Worth stressing amid my quibble is that Lewis’s very thorough history of money confirms my thesis that “adjustments of the monetary base” in order to maintain a stable currency don’t mean nearly as much as the standard itself. About this, Lewis writes “although the management of the U.S. dollar was problematic throughout the 1950s and 1960s,” the “broader picture of that time period reflected the dollar’s stability vs. gold at $35/oz./ not so much differently than if the dollar had been correctly managed.”Where it gets interesting is that per Lewis, “It was not until the effective break of that gold parity, in August 1971, that the accumulated errors of the previous two decades exploded into a whirlwind of consequences.” [emphasis – all mine].  It’s not as though so-called “money supply” surged right after August 15, 1971 only for the dollar to plummet; rather it became apparent in August of 1971 that the dollar’s relationship with gold would be severed.  Getting right to the point, the decline of the dollar wasn’t rooted in a failure to “adjust the monetary base” as much as it represented a failure on the part of the Nixon administration to maintain the standard.  Fed Chairman Arthur Burns recoiled at Nixon’s decision much as Eugene Meyer did in 1933 when FDR devalued.Applying all of this to Lewis’s 5,000 year history of money, central banks are a very modern concept in the grand scheme of things.  This rates mention because monetarists, modern Austrians, supply siders, libertarians, and seemingly every other ideology under the sun buy into the notion that central banks are responsible for the integrity of money.  They supposedly control the supply, or the “adjustments of the monetary base,” and by extension they allegedly control the price.  Or standard.  Except that this isn’t true.  That it isn’t true is loudly stated in Lewis’s essential book.Lewis has once again discussed stable money over a 5,000 year timeframe; one mostly free of central banks.  This matters because as Lewis points out, devaluations of commodity-defined money are as old as commodity defined money itself.  Crucial about all this is that you don’t need a central bank to devalue the currency.  What you need is a deviation from the standard, and governments have been doing this for thousands of years.All of the above is a long way of saying that Lewis’s prominent discussion of central banks in a breathtakingly great book about money was arguably a non sequitur.  While the paranoid in our world can’t have a discussion of inflation or deflation without ranting about the Fed, the Rockefellers, Jewish speculators, and the laughable correlation between the Fed’s creation in 1913 and the value of the dollar since, Lewis plainly knows different.  He knows better than anyone that monetary authorities were devaluing “money” through dismissal of standards long before anyone even began contemplating central banks.  Good money is an effect of a standard, not the “adjustment of the monetary base.”That’s why it was disappointing toward book’s end that Lewis, after having discredited nearly every monetary fallacy under the sun, gave airtime to books like Fed Up.  He did this despite their endless promotion of the very myths his essential book so expertly discredits.  In giving airtime to the nuts, Lewis provided oxygen to the crowd that continues to pervert what should be a simple discussion about money fulfilling its purpose as an agreement about value that facilitates trade and specialization.  Simply put, the Fed is not the story here.Indeed, per Lewis’s very own book the Fed was supposed to be idle, even for “decades.” Yet in the book’s concluding chapter, he conflates his unrivaled understanding of money as a stable unit with the notion that central banks must change their policies to get us back to the stable money he desires.  Really? Why? How? Were they necessary during the thousands of years during which myriad stable-money standards came about? What would the Fed do?Most important of all is a question that’s no longer asked: what has the Fed ever had to do with money’s exchange value, good or bad in the first place? It’s worth asking mainly because the Fed was formed in 1913, but it’s not as though there were no dollar devaluations before 1913.  Considering the 100+ years since the Fed came into being, Chairman Meyer once again resigned over FDR’s decision to devalue in 1933, the post-WWII Bretton Woods agreement was handled by the U.S. Treasury (properly so since the dollar’s exchange rate is not part of the Fed’s portfolio), and Fed Chairman Burns protested Nixon’s decision to scrap Bretton Woods in 1971.Fast forward to 1979, and Paul Volcker approached Fed policy through a quantity theory; as in shrink the supply to bolster the dollar.  Except that the dollar initially plummeted to $875/gold oz.  Lewis cites the Volcker/Greenspan era as one in which they allegedly targeted $350 gold, but during that time the two major monetary agreements (Plaza and Louvre) were Treasury affairs, as they should have been.  Treasury is the dollar’s mouthpiece, while Fed officials almost never mention the greenback.  It’s not their role.  After that, while gold stayed within a very “rough band” of $350 under Volcker and Greenspan, it’s notable that the dollar began a long slide in 2002.  Did Greenspan’s policies change all of a sudden? Was he no longer adjusting the base properly, or did dollar supply surge overnight such that $350 was no longer realistic? It’s hard to countenance any of those theories.  The realistic answer is that while the Reagan and Clinton administrations were broadly for a strong dollar, George W. Bush wanted a weaker one.  Markets complied.  That the dollar no longer has a strict definition offered up by politicians doesn’t mean that politics no longer inform its value.  The person in the White House changed, and with it, so did the dollar’s value.  Just as equity prices aren’t informed by supply and demand, neither are currency prices.  They’re an effect of a standard, or a stance.  It’s just not realistic to presume that Greenspan adjusted supply overnight after 2002 such that the “rough band” of $350 no longer worked.So while it says here once again that the pivot to the Fed was a puzzling one in a book that’s about the history of stable money, readers should not be deterred.  Nathan Lewis has another masterpiece on his hands.  People need to read Gold: The Final Standard, then read it again and again.  So much information is within this brilliant book, and so much misinformation is exposed.  Thank goodness for Nathan Lewis.John Tamny is a Forbes contributor, editor of RealClearMarkets, Director of the Center for Economic Freedom at FreedomWorks, and a senior economic adviser to Toreador Research & Trading. He’s the author of Popular Economics (Regnery Publishing, 2015), Who Needs the Fed? (Encounter 2016), and then his next book, The End of Work (Regnery) about the ongoing explosion of jobs that don't feel like work, will be released in 2018.  "

That acquisition is a major reason that Google is such a dominant force in online advertising today.","ShutterstockIt's estimated that Google's ad network reaches about a quarter billion unique viewers in the U.S. alone. With access to that many computers, it's no wonder cybercriminals are abusing DoubleClick in order to distribute money-making malware. The malware's goal: to mine cryptocurrency on infected computers and funnel earnings back to its criminal controllers.Security researchers at Trend Micro have spotted malicious activity tied to a new campaign in five countries so far: France, Italy, Japan, Spain and Taiwan. The attack delivers Coinhive, a mining script that has legitimate applications. One of those is providing online publishers with an alternative to ads or subscriptions. In this case, however, Coinhive is being installed without permission and its distributors are profiting from the infections.This new kind of malware has been dubbed cryptojacking, and its use by criminal hackers has skyrocketed in recent months. It's not an entirely new concept. For years, hackers have been using malware to enslave their victims' computers. So-called ""zombie"" systems have been used in different ways -- to launch DDoS attacks, for example, or to help hackers break in to other people's accounts.Now many of those infected systems are silently mining cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero. Making any real money by mining requires massive amounts of computing power. A single computer won't have much success, but tens of thousands working together can produce a steady stream of income.It's worth a hacker's time, then, to figure out ways around Google's defenses and sneak malicious ads onto their network. With hundreds of millions of potential targets out there, infecting even a small percentage could lead to a serious cryptocurrency windfall.Trend Micro has already reported its findings to Google, which has always moved swiftly to put a stop to malicious activity on its services. The trick will be keeping pace with hackers, who will no doubt use every trick in their arsenal to further their cryptojacking schemes.I've reached out to Google for comment and will update this post with the company's response."

Canada vs. the U.S., Bitcoin and more. How is the Canadian startup ...","Jan 16, 2018,02:53pm EST",Shutterstock,"Thirty-year-old Mike Katchen knew that Millennials needed a different kind of investment company than the previous generation. He and his two friends, Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler, had just sold their Y Combinator startup, 1000Memories, to Ancestry.com and couldn’t find an investment company that didn’t require quarterly face-to-face meetings and other archaic trappings in order to discuss their money. That’s why they founded Wealthsimple in September 2014. Based in Toronto, they found that there was a ripe market for digital investment solutions that catered directly to Millennials. Launched in 2017 in the U.S. and the U.K., Wealthsimple has quickly taken the digital investment space by storm with their anytime one-on-one financial advice, phone-based investment control, and even a “Money Diaries” series featuring celebs (Anthony Bourdain, Kylie Jenner and Woody Harrelson have all participated, among others) and other interesting people talking candidly about their money anxieties. I recently sat down with Katchen to find out more about his thoughts on Canada vs. the U.S., Bitcoin and more. How is the Canadian startup scene different than Silicon Valley?It’s an exciting time for startups in Canada. Companies like Shopify and Hootsuite have made a name for themselves internationally, and we’re starting to see the ecosystem here come of age. Toronto was named the most diverse city in the world, which creates an exciting pool of talent -- both people who are already here, and people from other parts of the world who see Toronto as a place that will welcome them.I started my career with McKinsey in Toronto, then moved to San Francisco to work with my Wealthsimple co-founders Brett Huneycutt and Rudy Adler on their Y Combinator company 1000Memories. I loved San Francisco for its energy, drive, and big ambitious thinking, while I love Toronto and Canada for its diversity and supportive community. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited our office. We wouldn't get that kind of recognition somewhere else.How does Millennials’ understanding of investing differ from previous generations?I’m a Millennial myself, and we came of age during the financial crisis. We've witnessed serious breaches of consumers’ trust by large financial institutions, so we don't have that inherent trust in big banks that maybe a previous generation did. Partly because of this skepticism, we really value transparency in investing, but also in all of our services. We want to know who we're paying, how much we're paying, and what we're paying for.We also understand how technology can be used to make our lives easier. We expect to be able to manage our money from our phone, the same way we can order a ride home, buy groceries or do anything else. Meeting a financial advisor for lunch once a quarter is not something most of us are interested in.What is your stance on Bitcoin as an investment?My stance is the same for Bitcoin as for any other volatile investment. It’s risky. There’s no way to know what will happen, and so investors should limit exposure if they want to manage the level of risk in their portfolio. A rule of thumb is to have no more than 5% of your liquid assets in “play money,” and be prepared if it goes to zero. Our portfolios use a passive investment strategy -- buy the market and hold it long-term -- because we know markets tend to increase in value over time. Smart investing is boring, but it works.How are you differentiating your brand in the digital investments space?Most investment firms, and really, most financial services companies, don’t have a brand that people can relate to. We made the decision early on to invest heavily in building a brand that humanizes financial services, which we think is a really big opportunity.Being human is central to our brand. We find that most traditional investment companies, and even the new players, are really good at talking to you about the mechanics of investing, like how oil prices and interest rates should effect next quarter. But the entire reason we exist, and why the investment industry exists, is to help you live the life you want.Our brand focuses on the “why” of investing over the “how.” That’s why we do things like our Money Diary series where we speak with interesting people about their personal stories around money, to help demystify talking about money and show that everyone has concerns and anxieties around it.You’re backed by Power Financial rather than a VC. How did the relationship come about?I met Paul Desmarais III, the third generation of the Power family, early on when Wealthsimple was a very new company.Power saw an opportunity to reach a new demographic and over the course of our relationship, they’ve continued to invest in the vision at Wealthsimple both financially and strategically. Our relationship with Power has really given us the best of both worlds: we have the independence to operate like a startup and be really quick and agile, but with the trust that comes with the backing of a large financial company.You’ve had celebrities ranging from Anthony Bourdain to Kylie Jenner participate in your “Money Diaries” series – what are the most common money challenges people share?We’ve had all sorts of people, from celebrities like Jon Hamm and Woody Harrelson, to a nun who took a vow of poverty, tell us their stories for our Money Diaries series. In our latest ad campaign, Investing for Humans, we had director Errol Morris interview regular people about their money thoughts, fears, anxieties and dreams, totally unscripted and unrehearsed. What we’ve found is that everyone, no matter how much or how little of it they have, fundamentally has the same anxiety: that they’re doing money wrong. That there is something better and smarter than they should be doing, and that maybe everyone else is doing, but they just don’t know enough. We really exist to close that gap. We want to help people do the smartest thing with their money, and feel confident and secure about it. "

Its transparency, reliability and decentralized nature make it the clear choice for securing intellectual or virtual assets like cryptocurrency.","But, blockchain's uses extend far beyond security, and experts believe we've only just scratched the surface of this technology's full potential. As the tech world continues to speculate about blockchain's future, we asked members of Forbes Finance Council to discuss some unexpected applications of blockchain that will positively impact businesses.Forbes Finance Council members discuss what applications could be ahead for blockchain technology.1. Reducing Carbon FootprintsBlockchain is an electronic ledger technology that has many applications, including cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The concept behind this provides a basis for technologically sound and secure payments without leaving behind a paper trail. This new form of managing transactions makes way for industries to facilitate merchant-customer interactions while reducing the carbon footprint. - Ibrahim AlHusseini, The Husseini Group2. Internet Of Things SecurityKeep an eye on blockchain integration with Internet of Things technology. Incorporating the security of blockchain with IoT devices will give customers a new level of security and comfort. This should lead to faster adoption of concepts like “smart home” technology and has the potential to spur growth in the IoT space. - Ismael Wrixen, FE International3. Contract Fraud Reduction Expect to see a reduction in fraud. Blockchains are going to digitize the world. Contracts are going to be embedded in digital code and stored in transparent, shared databases. Every agreement in this world will be protected from deletion, tampering, revisions, etc. - Justin Goodbread, Heritage Investors4. Secure, Real-Time Payment Blockchain will allow for real-time payments, which will result in faster speeds of service from every aspect. For example, wire transfers usually take three days, and that can represent a huge deficiency for a business. With blockchain-enabled instant payments, they can move on to other things much faster. - Chad Otar, Excel Capital Management, Inc.5. Supply Chain EfficiencyBlockchain will enable companies to communicate with vendors efficiently, viewing available inventory in the vendors' warehouses and tracking that inventory as it moves through the supply chain, all the way to delivery of a sales order to their customer. - Ben Taylor, SoftLedger6. Credit Accessibility For Small BusinessBlockchain will undoubtedly have a tremendous effect on trust in business transactions. While external auditing is rarely done for small businesses, the ability of blockchain accounting software to provide transparency to third parties will allow for easier access to capital for these businesses without the large expense of audits or the large premium charged for uncertainty. - Vlad Rusz, Vlad Corp. USA7. Clarity In Business Agreements And TransactionsBlockchain helps to clarify and document business transactions. Things previously done on a handshake will be codified and subject to the smart contract the parties have agreed to. Once the smart contract is fulfilled, the counterparty will be paid. Think about a world with no more accounts receivable float or collections calls. You do what you agreed to, and the payment is released. - Matthew May, Acuity"

entitled â€œBitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System.","Feb 2, 2018,09:00am EST",Pexels,"With its ideator somewhat shrouded in mystery, blockchain is being heralded as the next-generation technology that some predict will have an equal or greater impact than the birth of the internet.In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (supposedly a pseudonym) published a whitepaper entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System.” Nakamoto’s paper posits that blockchain technology can be used to allow the exchange of peer-to-peer payments without the need for traditional financial institutions to host such transactions.The beauty of the blockchain for many is its unchangeable nature. Through a combined use of cryptography, a peer-to-peer network and a protocol, blockchain hosts a distributed, immutable ledger. As a result, it promises to host much more than digital currencies. In fact, it may just be the marketplace of the future, where goods, services and assets can be exchanged without the need for traditional business frameworks.Many technologists (myself included) argue that blockchain will have a transformative impact on business processes and will democratize innovation, making it possible for small businesses to play in the same sandbox as their enterprise counterparts.  Today, data is being heralded as the new gold, particularly big, structured data. Such data holds value in that when combined with applications and other technologies like machine learning, the results are powerful. Take virtual assistants like Siri or Alexa that rely on natural language processing (NLP) and massive sets of data to effectively communicate with smartphone users. Without massive sets of data to train and interact with, the application alone holds hardly any value. Given that you need both to monetize and market applications or solutions, a startup or small business has little chance of success since each lacks big data -- or very much data at all for that matter. Despite having a great product and a solid business, some small businesses even operate for years without sophisticated tools like a CRM or email marketing automation, for example.The digital universe is growing at such a rapid rate that even enterprise companies cannot keep up with the maintenance and management of data. According to IDC, ""Like the physical universe, the digital universe is large -- by 2020 containing nearly as many digital bits as there are stars in the universe. It is doubling in size every two years, and by 2020 the digital universe -- the data we create and copy annually -- will reach 44 zettabytes, or 44 trillion gigabytes.""Businesses that can leverage AI and monetize its data are well-positioned to derive actionable business intelligence and value, according to a 2017 study from Accenture.RepuX uses the blockchain as the platform for enterprises to safely and securely exchange monetized data in a trusted marketplace. Developers will be able to apply machine learning to structured data pools and create high-value software applications or algorithms that can be used by businesses of any size.  Because the real value of data resides not in the data itself but in the assumptions and predictions that can be derived from it, there is great potential and power in the RepuX marketplace. Here, enterprises can share data with developers in real time, who in turn can preview or subscribe to it or even choose companies with a strong reputation for solid data. Developers can then sell their applications or algorithms to SMBs to use in growing their businesses.The cryptographically secure and frictionless platform enables a safe exchange of data and resolves the primary disconnect in today’s digital economy: the inability of enterprises to securely share siloed business analytics with developers that can apply artificial intelligence or machine learning.  Powered by Ethereum blockchain 2.0 technology, RepuX acts as the missing link between enterprises and the emerging talent pool of AI-focused developers. Bloom is using blockchain technology to take on the broken credit system. Founded by Ryan Faber, Jesse Leimgruber, Alain Meier and John Backus, the team combines seasoned entrepreneurs and Stanford computer scientists with a long track record in identity, data and compliance.Right now, credit scores do not work across borders. This means your score resets when you move to a new country. Lenders in markets with less developed financial and regulatory infrastructure struggle to issue credit to borrowers since they have limited identity and scoring data to base credit decisions. Plus, credit systems rely on historical debt repayment information and therefore cannot easily accommodate users who are new to credit. This is especially prevalent among minorities, the underbanked, millennials and anyone who's never owned a credit card.The BloomScore is similar to FICO or VantageScore scores, but the company has updated the model to better reflect a given consumer’s creditworthiness.The system also uses blockchain and IPFS to increase security. In the current credit system, you must divulge all your information, including your social security number, needed for a hacker to steal your identity. With Bloom, your personal information is never exposed. This helps to prevent attacks like the one that decimated Equifax last fall when the personal information of more than 145 million Americans was compromised.The prospects for blockchain technology to facilitate innovation within multiple industries are endless. With BaaS, we can swiftly develop, test and deploy blockchain applications for distributed ledgers. Financial institutions will unquestionably discover solutions to use artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain jointly to more proficiently store and analyze big data. This could then be used as an enhanced platform to deal with the massive volume of data associated with billions of connected Internet-of-Things devices."

And, they are not alone. Any business with valuable digital assets from contacts to contracts they need to protect can find a legitimate use case for blockchain technology.What makes blockchain powerful?Blockchains, whether public or private, are a real-time ledger of records stored in a distributed, peer-to-peer fashion independent from any central authority. Since every record is encrypted and time-stamped and users can only access and edit the block they “own” through a private key, it’s very secure. Every block is linked to the one before and the one after it, and whenever a change is made, the entire chain gets updated. Blockchain helps secure and streamline transactions efficiently without requiring intermediaries to manage the process. Blockchain technology is revolutionary in terms of record keeping and can track and document every change in a record or transaction.What are the practical uses of blockchain?If you haven’t already realized it, blockchain technology is going to change many systems that you encounter in your day-to-day life. Here are a few of the practical examples:Contract management and smart contractsAny industry heavily reliant on contracts, such as insurance, financial institutions, real estate, construction, entertainment and law, would benefit from blockchain’s indisputable way to update, manage, track and secure contracts. Smart contracts, those that are embedded with if/then statements and be executed without the involvement of an intermediary, also use blockchain technology.Payment processing and currencyEven if you’re not using Bitcoin, the most famous and widely adopted digital currency that runs by blockchain technology, its influence is only expected to expand. Blockchain has the potential to be highly transformative to any company that processes payments. It can eliminate the need for intermediaries that are common in payment processing today.Supply chain managementWhenever value changes hands or the status of asset changes, blockchain is ideally suited for managing the process. That’s why some experts believe blockchain can become a ""supply chain operating system."" It’s already being used by Walmart and its Food Safety Collaboration Centre in Beijing to track farm origination details, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, storage temperature and shipping details for pork. Blockchain allows for immediate status updates and increases the security and visibility of the supply chain. It provides any industry that needs to track a processor supplies—ultimately that’s most industries—an immediate and indisputable tracking system.Asset protectionWhether you’re a musician who wants to ensure you get royalties when your music gets played or a property owner, blockchain technology can help you protect your assets by creating an indisputable record of real-time ownership. That’s precisely the service Everledger, a global startup, aims to do by using blockchain and smart contracts. Specifically created to improve anti-counterfeit measures for pharmaceuticals, luxury items, diamonds and electronics, BlockVerify allows companies to register their own products and introduces transparency to supply chains.Identification, personal record systems and passwordsGovernments manage vast amounts of personal data from birth and death records to marriage certificates, passports and census data. Blockchain technology offers a streamlined solution for managing all of it securely. Personal identification is what Onename, a blockchain startup wants to manage. In addition to offering services to register and manage a blockchain ID, the company offers a product called Passcard that they intend as a digital key to replace all passwords and IDs required for individuals, including driver’s licenses. ShoCard is another identity management system in use today that helps individuals and enterprises quickly validate identity.There are many other practical uses cases for blockchain technology for our everyday life and business operations. As the investments in blockchain solutions start to yield results in the way of innovative blockchain-enabled products and services, we will continue to see the practical applications of the technology exponentially expand. I believe the transformation will be dramatic."

Have 48 bitcoins ...,"Jan 22, 2018,02:08pm EST","Last week, the U.S. Global Investors office was visited by a living legend in the junior mining industry, billionaire founder and executive chairman of Ivanhoe Mines, Robert Friedland. In case you don’t know, back in the mid-1970s, Robert was caretaker of an apple orchard south of Portland that one of his buddies from Reed College would often visit. That buddy’s name was Steve Jobs, who later went on to found a little company he named — what else? — Apple.","Before Robert and Steve Jobs began palling around, Jobs was known as shy and withdrawn. It was Robert who taught him his skills in what’s been described by many as “reality distortion.” Having seen numerous speeches by Robert over the years, I can attest to his masterful ability to utterly command a room of hundreds with his electric charisma. Some of that charisma must have rubbed off on Jobs, helping the future iPhone innovator evolve into the shrewd, larger-than-life business leader he’s celebrated as today.Robert Friedland and Frank HolmesRobert’s “reality distortion” was on full display during his visit. I was pleased and honored, as were my U.S. Global team members, to have the opportunity to hear his unique insights on a wide range of issues, from the debilitating smog in Delhi, India; to China’s efforts to become the world’s leading electric vehicle (EV) economy; to Ivanhoe’s development of the Kamoa-Kakula Copper Project in the Democratic Republic of Congo, independently ranked as the largest high-grade copper discovery in the world.Robert made a very compelling case for Kamoa-Kakula, which he calls “the most disruptive Tier One copper project in the world today.” In its first year of production, its average copper grade is estimated to average an ultra-high 7.3 percent. Because the site is flat and uninhabited, and wages are paid in local currency, the cash cost for the life of the mine is projected to be a low, low $0.64 per pound of copper. As of my writing this, copper is priced at $3.20 a pound, so the margin is significant. After an initial $1.2 billion in capital costs to develop the project, the company expects a payback period of only 3.1 years.It’s all a very attractive proposition.I reminded Robert that we’re bullish on both copper and the industries it supports, including the imminent EV revolution and massive electricity demand in emerging markets, especially China and India. EVs, as I’ve pointed out before, require three to four times as much copper as traditional gas-powered vehicles. By 2027, as much as 1.74 million metric tons of copper will be needed to meet EV demand alone, up from only 185,000 tons today, according to the International Copper Association.The red metal was one of the best performing commodities last year, surging more than 30 percent, and with investment demand near all-time highs, I predict another year of phenomenal returns. That would represent a third straight year of positive gains, something copper hasn’t accomplished this decade.As you can see below, open interest in copper futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is still historically high, even after cooling somewhat from its all-time high set in late July, when contracts hit an average 319,000 contracts. Open positions last month averaged more than 285,000, up 7.3% from the previous month and 26.9 percent from December 2016.Open interest in copper futures off record, still historically highRobert expressed confidence that copper — along with aluminum, cobalt, nickel, platinum and scandium — will be among the biggest beneficiaries of the global transition to EVs and clean energy.“You’re going to need a telescope to see copper prices in 2021,” he told us theatrically.A rally is already in the works. From its recent low two years ago this month, the Bloomberg Industrial Metals Subindex, which tracks aluminum, copper, nickel and zinc, has surged more than 65 percent. Support looks strong, and copper prices could be headed even higher on global supply disruptions, as labor negotiations continue in Chile, the world’s top producer of the red metal.“There are between 20 and 25 collective negotiations expected. If some of them lead to significant strikes, that would have a positive impact on [copper] prices,” explained Sergio Hernandez, vice president of Cochilco, Chile’s state copper commission.Industrial metals exhibiting strong upward momentumOther fundamental trends are driving commodities, as I’ve noted earlier. The global purchasing manager’s index (PMI), a gauge of the manufacturing industry, is near a seven-year high. Construction confidence in the eurozone turned positive. And construction spending here in the U.S. hit $1.257 trillion in November, a new high.About half of all the copper produced globally every year is consumed by China. Last year, the Asian giant set a new record in importing the red metal. Imports climbed to a never-before-seen 17.35 million metric tons in 2017, up 2.3 percent from the previous year.China's copper imports notched yet another record in 2017The metal is needed not just for the construction of new buildings but also to manufacture millions of new electric vehicles in the world’s largest auto market. Sometime this year, China is expected to announce when it plans to outlaw gas-powered vehicles, joining a growing number of other countries, including the U.K. (which is shooting for a 2040 ban), France (2040), Germany (2030), India (“next 13 years”) and more.According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, about 1,293 gigawatts per hour (GWh) are forecast for the lithium-ion battery market. That’s up spectacularly from only 19 GWh in 2015. About two thirds of the demand will come from China and the U.S.Forecasted demand for lithium-ion batteries from electric vehiclesTo accommodate all these new EVs, China has pledged to build a charging station for every vehicle on the road by 2020. That equates to around 4.8 million charging outlets and stations, requiring a total investment of $19 billion. China had 190,000 charging stations at the end of September, so to call this goal ambitious is an understatement. The U.S., by comparison, has a little over 64,000 outlets and stations around the country, according to the Department of Energy.Even William Ford Jr., Ford Motor’s executive chairman, acknowledged that the Chinese are more aggressive than most in their mission to fully embrace the electric vehicle. “When I think of where EVs are going,” Ford said in Shanghai last month, “it’s clearly the case that China will lead the world in EV development.”Not only was China the largest importer of copper, crude oil, natural gas and other natural resources, it also outspent every other country in new clean energy capacity. The country invested as much as $132.6 billion in 2017, about 16 percent more than the U.S. and Europe combined. The government’s efforts already seem to be having a positive effect, as sales of face masks and air purifiers in Beijing have fallen dramatically compared to last winter.Sales of face masks in beijing are down this year thanks in part to the government's huge investment... [+] in clean energyAnother market that’s in urgent need of clean energy is India. In Delhi, the country’s capital territory, the air quality has become so noxious and filled with heavy metals that the World Health Organization has likened it to smoking at least 50 cigarettes a day. The city’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, went so far as to call it a “gas chamber.”It’s not just governments seeking to diversify their energy mix. Royal Dutch Shell, the largest oil company in Europe, is steadily acquiring smaller providers of electrical power and natural gas. In December it announced a deal to buy retail energy provider First Utility. It’s just the latest in a series of purchases by large oil and gas companies looking ahead to the day when charging stations, rather than gas stations, might be the norm.In an interview this month, Shell CEO Ben van Beurden sees the current energy transition as an opportunity.“We have to embrace the future, and the future will include battery electric cars,” van Beurden said. “Importantly, I believe Shell can achieve this without destroying value in the company. It is about identifying real business opportunities to thrive through the energy transition.”As my friend Robert Friedland sees it, those business opportunities lie in copper, aluminum, cobalt and other key industrial metals.“We’re in the battery business,” he told us, adding that very little of lithium-ion batteries is actually lithium.Have 48 bitcoins? This Lamborghini could be yours! (Here at the Black Diamond Investment Conference... [+] in Delray Beach, Florida.)Last week I was in Delray Beach, Florida, attending the Black Diamond Investment Conference, where I was excited to see a 2007 Lamborghini Murcielago for sale. It wasn’t so much the fact that it was a Lamborghini but that the sellers were seeking payment in cryptocurrency only. In case you have 48 bitcoins lying around—valued at a little over half a million dollars at today’s price—you could be the proud new owner of a top-quality sports car. I’m pleased to see even more transactions being made in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.All opinions expressed and data provided are subject to change without notice.

invested in Bitcoin two years ago. Yet there are still some ways to prosper.","Jan 15, 2018,09:01am EST","Making money doesn't have to be complicated, but we throw way too many emotions into the mix. It can be a lot simpler.","This year won't be any different than any other. Markets will go up and down. Investors will lust after the latest cryptocurrency or stock.But there are a few essential things you need to know to get ahead. Think of one goal: Saving more money. Then forget about returns.ShutterstockBoy, doesn't that sound easy? Well, it's not, because we're not only obsessed with returns, but go crazy when we hear someone else is making a killing in some investment that we haven't discovered.
I know this can be maddening. I, like billions of others, wouldn't mind winning the lottery or have invested in Bitcoin two years ago. Yet there are still some ways to prosper. Here are my boiled-down action items:-- Save As Much as You Can. If you're not saving anything, pay down your debt and get your spending in line with your income. What's a good goal?Enough to create an emergency fund that will cover out-of-pocket expenses in case something breaks or isn't covered by insurance. Tally up your insurance deductibles and other financial goals.At a minimum, try to save at least 10% to 15% of your income through all sources -- 401(k)s, IRAs, insured savings accounts.-- Save Automatically. Yes, put this on auto-pilot by taking withdrawals out of your paycheck or checking account every month. Then automatically deposit money from your earnings into savings or investment accounts. What you can't touch, you won't spend.That way, you know your emergency and long-term savings accounts are getting funded.-- Diversify your savings. Shop around for the best rates on money-market funds and certificates of deposit. The best rates are online. According to Ken Tumin of DepositAccounts.com:""For primary checking needs, switch to a high-yield reward checking account to earn a significantly higher interest rate. Open an online savings account. These accounts can offer interest rates much higher than what’s available at brick-and-mortar banks and credit unions.""If you're saving in your 401(k), that means you're making monthly contributions. And when you get a raise, bump up your investing amount.When should you make contributions? All the time. Don't wait for the market to go up or down. Constantly make investments in index funds that own large pieces of the global stock and bond markets.Continuous investing in new shares is called ""dollar cost averaging."" By averaging your contribution prices over time, you rarely get the highest or lowest price. When the market dips, you're getting bargain-priced shares.What if you own single stocks? Then get into a company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan or DRIP. Almost all companies will allow you to buy new shares and reinvest dividends at no commission. For more on DRIPs, click here."

Ripple Network",https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2018/01/29/exchange-launching-soccer-related-cryptocurrency-in-world-first-using-ripple-network/,"... and Stellar networks to support token issuance, trades, and transfers, 
with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all accepted as part of its token sale.","Jan 29, 2018,12:50pm EST","Sooner or later it had to come - cryptocurrency entering the soccer arena with its legions of supporters around the globe. Now the London Football Exchange (LFE) is set to launch a cryptocurrency to power an ecosystem of “inter-related components” made up of sports, media, entertainment, finance and a foundation.","This will allow a “fan-driven” football community the opportunity to take part in various club and fan experiences from match day tickets, tours and player meet and greets (VIP experiences) to specific merchandise and third-party partner offers. The touted goal is to create the “ultimate sport community” for fans, so those heading the initiative claim.The development comes as we are seeing a Blockchain idea almost every minute at the moment. The technology has the capability to meet virtually any use case, which is the easy part. However, the real issue and $64 million question centres on whether it can attract customers and monetize the technology or service stemming from it.The initiative from the LFE followed just days after CashBet announced last week (January 24) what was described as a “landmark partnership” with English Premier League football club Arsenal FC - prior to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) of its new cryptocurrency, CashBet Coin. This is designed specifically for iGaming. It made CashBet Coin the North London club’s exclusive and official Blockchain Partner.Calum Chambers of Arsenal during a training session at London Colney on January 29, 2018 in St... [+] Albans, England. (Photo by Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images).For its part, CashBet is targeting a global, multi-billion dollar marketplace of iGaming content providers, operators and players according to the firm’s CEO and founder Dr. Mike Reaves.And, their CEO asserted that the token “will improve the online experience for real money, casino, social, skill-based, eSports and sports betting players through increased trust and transparency, faster payouts, reduced fees and dedicated player protection.”The move by the LFE, which said it aims to use blockchain technology to help clubs provide loyal fans with enhanced experiences and services, also comes against the backdrop of a number of UK football clubs currently outsourcing their match day and season ticketing to legacy platforms and paying around 5% in fees.It is being claimed by the protagonists behind the project that this “moves to zero.” Bold stuff. Indeed, the LFE is insisting that participating clubs must pass some of this saving onto the fans directly of the “beautiful game”, which globally is estimated to have four billion fans.The football exchange revealed that it intends to use the Ripple and Stellar networks to support its endeavors for its platform, with the LFE to launch both the LFE Market and the Exchange. This will enable fans to easily purchase club merchandise, access exclusive services and other exclusive packages and purchase with LFE token - from anywhere in the world.Specifically, LFE’s platform will use the Ripple and Stellar networks to support token issuance, trades, and transfers, with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple all accepted as part of its token sale.Charles Pittar, Corporate CEO of the London Football Exchange, commenting in the wake of the development said: “Our vision is to allow football clubs to take advantage of the token funding economy for their financing needs by providing them with a tokenized financing infrastructure, which involves token-design and issuance services.”In terms of the mechanics behind this, it is explained that by creating the LFE Market, fans and clubs are able to come together with common interest in the business of the sport.Fans holding LFE tokens will have the opportunity to partake in club financing packages and be directly rewarded and take equity ownership at a lower cost than any single club could do individually. (Note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely unregulated. Anyone considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment).A number of discussions have been initiated by the London Football Exchange and already underway with over fifty clubs. The list spans not juts UK Premier League clubs, but some of the most prominent teams throughout Europe, the United States and Australia.Ben Leigh-Hunt, a main board advisor, revealed: “We are announcing our first Global Loyal Fan Experience later this week. Equity participants shall be announced in the coming weeks as currently we have to let the lawyers do their ‘lawyering’ with various clubs.”Football Club Equity ExchangeIn terms of the football club equity exchange, Pittar, who previously was Asia COO at Macquarie Bank for three years and a director at Citi before that explained: “The LFE aims to become a “one-stop shop” for clubs of all sizes to raise capital via equity sales and also offer LFE contributors a wealth of fan experiences and social interaction.”Fans will also be offered the chance to buy shares of football clubs. That said, for some British clubs outside the very top flight - Leeds United, Millwall and Celtic to name a few - the experience of floating on the stockmarket has not exactly proved scintillating with their stock prices performing woefully.And, for other clubs the stockmarket route has been soggy at best- if not waterlogged - just like a good old British soccer pitch in winter.However, it should be pointed here out that those named clubs tried to support individual programs. By offering the global market and exchange on the Blockchain, LFE has argued that is able to bring cost savings, economies of scale and “higher security to capital programs.”To coin a footballing analogy similar to “Getting into Europe”, let’s imagine an English Football league (EFL) 1 or 2 club in the lower reaches of the EFL pyramid being on the equity exchange and being traded side by side with some of the largest clubs in La Liga in Spain, Ligue 1 in France or the Bundesliga in Germany.“We expect the clubs to benefit from this brand association and the fact that this global exposure will encourage fans from farther afield to build a portfolio of clubs in the same way we may buy stocks in London, New York and Tokyo,” stated Pittar.By investing in its token they get exclusive access to football-related services, merchandise, events and unique VIP experiences. For clubs, it enables an injection of fresh capital to create added-value to boost club financing, helping improve fan engagement and promoting social good, youth development and gender equality.As regards exactly how the exchange aims to become a “one-stop shop” for clubs of all sizes to raise capital via equity sales, there are three primary components to the LFE.Pittar added: “Clubs will be encouraged to offer some equity through the LFE and required to offer a minimum number of unique experiences or special offers so that the real fans can take part in their favourite clubs.”Towards this endeavor, LFE is being advised on the launch by leading law firm CMS.Sam Robinson, a partner at CMS, remarked: “As a firm, CMS has a particular focus on fintech and it’s very exciting to be advising the LFE on establishing a business that is aiming to have an impact on the entire football industry using blockchain technology.” The lawyer described LFE as being at the “cutting edge of regulation and technology.”LFE engagement services will include LFE Points, a blockchain-enabled loyalty, rewards and offers platform. Members of the football exchange benefit through special discounts, exclusive offers, rewards and other incentives only available to LFE token holders.The greater the engagement LFE token holders have with their favourite clubs and leagues, the more LFE Points they will receive.For the clubs, the LFE tokens are touted as aiming to also help them eliminate the antiquated ticketing technology from legacy operators. This can typically mean they pay fees ranging from 5% to 8% in commission based on the notional value of tickets sold.As regards disrupting the landscape, Jeremy Drzal, founder and CEO of BLOCK512 and LFE advisor, said: “Not only is LFE changing the technology platforms with blockchain and cryptocurrency, but we are disrupting the business models so we can bring the savings directly back to the fans.”Gaining Traction?Gary Wright, CEO & founder of City thinktank B.I.S.S. Research, a former executive at JPMorgan Flemings and life-long Tottenham Hotspurs fan, commenting on the merits of the blockchain use case being applied by LFE said: “There is some mileage in the idea, but implementation might be problematic.”That said, he expressed caution and some doubt over whether this particular use case would gain much traction.He added: “Even if it did it would spawn any number from its success and create confusion for its proposed customers - the football fans. I doubt also that football clubs and the associations they are members of would tolerate potential revenues flying out their window.”Most likely according to Wright is that the football establishment would “build a market structure around Blockchain that brings all their members into line and offers the football fan customers with security and build on their fan worship.” He noted that Stub hub already offer a ticket tout type service that some clubs utilize but that often frustrates the fans.”Elsewhere, John Barker, non-executive Chairman of Russia-focused brokerage ITI Group, and an avid Queens Park Rangers fan, said: “I see Blockchain and The London Football Exchange looking to launch its own cryptocurrency as forward thinking.”The gaming and technology expert, who was former managing director and Head of International at institutional dark pool trading network Liquidnet Europe (2001- 2012), also  by way of proxy for the LFE’s future potential cited The Football Exchange, which offers two-way (buy/sell) prices in the favourite players of fans. It appears to have met with some success.“There are billions of football fans and they are a young demographic and keen to invest in their favourite players,” Barker added.Whatever else, the protagonist behind the exchange’s project venture that Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are important for the LFE because they bring security, transparency, and lower cost to operate the system.“By reducing the third-party payment processing costs, fraud and risk, the savings can directly go back into the ecosystem for fans, businesses and other programs such as youth development,” Pittar said.The LFE’s ITO pre-sale, which commenced on 15 January 2018 and runs to 11 February 2018 at a token price of $0.12 per unit. Thereafter the price rises to $0.14 (early backers) and $0.20 in the third round of the ITO. It is understood that 60% of a total 4 billion tokens are to be made available to the fans, with 2% earmarked to support the LFE Foundation. For more information on the LFE and to read the whitepaper on the project view this link.Subsequent to this story being published on February 14, FC Bari 1908, who currently play in Italy’s Serie B, agreed to become the first Italian club to join the London Football Exchange in order to access the LFE Fan Experience platform by trading football equity on the blockchain.Cosmo Antonio Giancaspro, Chairman of FC Bari 1908, commenting said: “We look forward to being one of the first clubs in the world to take advantage of this revolutionary technology, considering that FC Bari is a club with a rich history, our fans are our life blood and we see this as a way to give back to them and reward their loyalty.”  "

point about bitcoin is it's off-grid, etc.' Okay you can stay off-grid, 
and ...","Jan 22, 2018,11:00am EST",Jibrel Network,"Compliance never looked this sexy.Much has been made of all the ways blockchain and cryptocurrencies can potentially displace existing infrastructure. For all the ways it can't—and there are many—Jibrel is leading the way in integrating the cutting edge technology with traditional assets, laying the foundation for blockchain implementations on a global scale.How? First: by setting the standard for cryptofiats with smart contracts. Cryptofiats refer to government-issued cryptocurrencies, typically backed by the central bank of said government. In other words, they're dollars, euros, or any other fiat currency underlaid by blockchain technology.""The use case for Jibrel is simple: if you want to use smart contracts in the real world, you need cryptofiats,"" Jibrel Co-Founder and Project Lead Yazan Barghuthi said in an interview with the author. ""We can agree that blockchains are amazing, and that the properties cryptocurrencies have are amazing—and we can agree that those two things when combined with smart contracts are amazing. That being said, people pay their bills, their loans, and their mortgages in dollars, euros, and pounds. They don’t pay them in ETH or BTC.""For a refresher on smart contracts, take a look at this piece in Motherboard. ""Blockchains are a database, a new way of storing data in a particular contract,""Barghuthi said. ""Smart contracts are a way to execute certain commands in a decentralized way, and be able to remove trusted intermediaries, or middlemen, from the equation.""Jibrel Network functionalityWith a smart contract, respective parties set terms and agree to them through blockchain, and these agreements are executed automatically henceforth. Ethereum introduced the concept, but now a host of other blockchain networks employ them, including Cardano, NEO, TRON, Qtum, among many others. Each of these networks implements smart contracts through their own ""in-house"" tokens. What Jibrel is doing is figuring out how you could enable this same system, but with traditional currencies. This applies for everyday use—the way you as an individual might use Venmo or PayPal—but maybe more importantly optimizes how governments and financial service companies can conduct transactions.""A huge benefit of smart contracts that people don’t touch on enough is how it removes subjectivity,"" Barghuthi said. ""And you can imagine why that would be something incredibly useful with some of the bloated processes or bureaucratic processes in financial services.""A way to consider how something like this would be useful for all of us: the 2008 financial crisis was precipitated by sub-prime bonds receiving high ratings based on a structure that incentivized rating agencies to rate bad products as AAA. This type of human error is exactly what Jibrel stands to eliminate.""If the loan data and rating methodology were recorded on the blockchain, these processes would be enforced without middlemen, but most importantly without subjectivity, without corruptibility, and human error in general,"" Barghuthi said. ""It’s almost like the natural progression of cash. As much as we can work with [governments] to create the optimum crypto fiat standard—even if this is a technology that we open source—this is where the market is headed, this is something everyone should be looking at. It’s what we believe to be the future—tokens in the backend""Barghuthi sees this as the optimal way to future-proof Jibrel as blockchain moves from a hyped technology to one that is just the functional backbone of existing systems.""Does the user need to know that he’s holding an Ethereum wallet, that these are stored in tokens?"" Barghuthi said. ""When we converted the dollar to online banking and we had a digital dollar, did we create a new asset class called the digital dollar? No we didn’t—it was still a dollar, it was merely a digital representation of it. If you are trading gold tokens, you’re a commodities broker. If you’re dealing with share tokens, you’re a securities broker. You’ll never be able to circumvent regulation in the long run. So the true value is in demoting these tokens to a backend system, where the user doesn’t know that it’s powered by cryptography.""CryDRsThis all may sound understandable enough, but ensuring that this is a practical solution for users across many different verticals requires a self-regulating receipt-based system. For that, Jibrel is also rolling out CryptoDepository Receipts, (CryDRs). These are tokens that represent a traditional financial asset’s value, which will be denominated in Jibrel Network Token (JNT). So, if you own $50 USD in gold, a USD CryDR will hold $50 worth of JNT.Because there is effectively an infinite set of possibilities in terms of how these CryDRs might need to be structured, they have smart regulation baked in, so that real-world regulations can be easily translated into solidity code (a coding language for Ethereum smart contracts). This will be especially appealing for those who see the writing on the wall in terms of regulation in crypto markets.CryDR""We're translating real-world regulation into solidity code and deploying it so that these token transfers can always be KYC compliant without a regulator intervening,"" Barghuthi said. ""It’s governance without governance. We can ensure that we still meet the KYC standards, the anti-money laundering, the anti-terrorism financing standards—all without killing the decentralized dream.""This also means that fiat CryDRs can be used for trading and hedging, as well as creating automated bonds, commodities, securities, and debt instruments.jCash, jWallet and the Jibrel Network Token Sale (JNT)To round out this system, Jibrel needed to create a system for these assets to transfer among currencies easily, as well as a safe place to store the sensitive information. That's where jCash and jWallet come into play.For its first roll-out, jCash, an ERC-20 token, will offer USD, GBP, EUR, RUB, AED, and CNY CryDRs.""All transfers on jCash are always AML KYC compliant,""Barghuthi said. ""We do get a bit of backlash from the community, like, 'Yeah, but the whole point about bitcoin is it’s off-grid, etc.' Okay you can stay off-grid, and that’s a $500 billion market. But if you go on-grid, you can start tackling the issues with the $34 trillion global economy.""jWalletjWallet was conceived after the Jibrel team surveyed the crypto wallet landscape and decided that they needed to build one with a higher degree of security.""We actually sat down and analyzed how all these wallets were built, and we’ve come to so many steps where we’re like, 'Why did they build it like this?'""Barghuthi said. ""So as we were looking to find a wallet for jCash that we can build functionality into, we found none, so we built our own. It’s plug-and-play, you just go to the website. Your private keys always stay private. It’s run off our own Ethereum nodes—you never have to bring your own Ethereum connection. It’s how we envision the future landscape to work.""To formally launch Jibrel, the Jibrel Network Token Sale began on Nov. 27, ultimately closing its hard cap a full month ahead of schedule on Dec. 27—demonstrating a clear industry belief in their cryptofiat token model.For more information on Jibrel Network, visit the official website, the company blog, or join the Telegram channel."

Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency established in 2008. But what is blockchain ...","Jan 22, 2018,08:15am EST",Shutterstock,"As the holidays wind down, many Americans start anticipating what can be a dreaded time of year for individuals and business alike: tax season. 2018 brings a fresh wave of worry and hope with the latest changes to the tax code, but one key issue stays the same — citizens have very little input into how their taxes are used by the federal government. For those unwilling to go full Thoreau on the problem (i.e., refuse to pay taxes and risk jail time), we typically just grumble about the injustice and submit our forms by April 15 anyway. But what if there was another way? To consider a unique solution, we must first understand the revolutionary technology that can get us there — blockchain.Blockchain BasicsThe most well-known use of blockchain technology right now is likely Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency established in 2008. But what is blockchain technology, and how does it allow our digital transactions to be more secure than ever before?Put simply, blockchain technology eliminates the current system of transactions in which every party involved has their own record of what happened during the transaction. Instead, blockchain creates a single, unalterable record of transactions that make up “blocks.” This is a permanent, indisputable record of authenticity and authorization that allows transactions to be secure and trusted over a digital network.As BlockGeeks puts it, “Picture a spreadsheet that is duplicated thousands of times across a network of computers. Then imagine that this network is designed to regularly update this spreadsheet and you have a basic understanding of the blockchain.”The key idea here is that everyone involved is engaging with the same record. A single record of the transaction means less wiggle room for altering the information that occurs when we rely on multiple copies of redundant records.The record of transactions itself becomes the form of trust. Not even a system administrator can delete a digital sequence in the chain, so users have full transparency around the transactions that are occurring. And what, exactly, are these data “sequences”? They are defined as: “a kind of self-auditing ecosystem of digital value, the network reconciles every transaction that happens in ten-minute intervals. Each group of these transactions is referred to as a 'block.'""Federal Tax Spending: Where We Are (And How Blockchain Can Help)So, what does blockchain technology have to do with taxes? Since this technology is both secure and robust enough to deal with a range of transaction types, it could actually be used to allow each taxpayer to set their own preference ratios of our national budget when filing. The result is that people would feel much more engaged when paying their taxes, and we’d have a stronger democratic society overall.Before we get into an example of how this works, let’s take a quick review of how our current federal budget is allocated, courtesy of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Our budget is divided into mandatory spending programs and discretionary spending programs, but the total breakdown is as follows:• Social Security: In 2016, 24% of the federal budget, or $916 billion, paid for Social Security, a program which provides for retirement income, as well as income for disabled workers and the families of deceased and disabled workers.• Healthcare Subsidies: The combined total of Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP and healthcare marketplace subsidies amounted to 26 percent of the budget in 2016, or $1 trillion.• Defense and International Security: In 2016, 16% of the budget, or $605 billion, was used for defense and international security.• Safety Net programs: 9% of the federal budget, or $366 billion, supports programs for families facing hardship, including SNAP food assistance and the Earned Income Tax Credit program (EITC).• Interest on Debt: In 2016, interest payments on debt owed took up $240 billion, or about 6% of the budget.• Everything Else: The remaining 19% of our federal budget is tasked with covering all other needs, including benefits for federal retirees and veterans (8%), infrastructure (2%), education (2%), science and medical research (2%), non-security related international programs (1%) and the remaining 3% is for all other federal spending.If blockchain technology was used for tax returns, a dedicated portion of each tax return would go to the mandatory spending, which includes social security, healthcare, veteran’s benefits, transportation and food and agriculture. The remaining amount (discretionary spending, of which over 50% is devoted to military and defense) could be categorized and the filer will be able to determine what percentage of their taxable income would go toward which area of need. As an example, an individual who really values STEM education could direct 75% of their discretionary amount towards K-12 education, which currently receives a tiny sliver of the overall federal budget.With blockchain as a way to authenticate and authorize these allocations, we can look at a family who owes $10,000 in federal taxes. 60% would go toward mandatory spending, or approximately $6,000 of their annual taxes, which is allocated as needed for the programs listed above. The remaining $4,000 would be divvied up based upon the interests of the taxpayer, but no category would be left completely blank. With every taxpayer contributing at least something to every category, we could get a better sense of our shared priorities and feel that we’re contributing to the budget in a meaningful way that truly reflects our values.Technology experts agree that blockchain will continue to serve as a powerful tool in a range of industries, so why can’t we use it to overhaul our democracy? Not only would this approach boost engagement and allow voters to have a real say in government spending, but it could create powerful shifts in how we fund the programs that matter to us most.."

[+] brand.,"There’s no doubt that 2017 was the year social media and Google heavily influenced consumers online buying decisions. Black Friday online sales actually broke a record surpassing five billion dollars. As the new year begins, it’s more important now than ever before to establish and execute a successful digital strategy.While not all marketing campaigns succeed, especially online, the ones that are successful often have many things in common. But who are the entrepreneurs behind many of these successful internet advertising campaigns? What do the successful campaigns have in common? Here is the advice these 8 digital marketing trendsetters have to offer that business can apply to improve the chances of their campaigns succeeding in the coming year.Plus a lesson from yours truly on what each means for CMOs.1. Don't Make It Personal 
Many entrepreneurs and marketers alike pick out a product they personally think is cool or have some kind of personal attachment to and then build campaigns that appeal to their personal interests, wondering why their campaign failed. To succeed in eCommerce you are better off ignoring your personal opinions and tastes and going with researched data and facts about niches that are having success being marketed online. Connecting those audiences with products that appeal to them by advertising is a much better way to affirm their interest and get them to buy from you. This is hard for a lot of entrepreneurs to get past, but as soon as they stop putting what they think is cool ahead of what the audience needs and wants, they start seeing a lot more success much faster. - Adrian Morrison, online marketer CMO Lesson: This has long been a pet peeve of mine. I have seen countless examples where CMOs and thus their teams look a given product, campaign, etc. from their personal vantage point instead of via the lens of the consumer AKA the one the people who will keep them employed in the first place. Think of them. Not you. 2. Build A CommunityThanks to the Internet, people are more connected and accessible than ever, but personally more disconnected. Since so much time is spent online, and advertising is so competitive, businesses have to reevaluate how they plan to build a relationship with customers in 2018. Building an online community of potential customers around topics that people are passionate about, and that also aligns with your business, is a sure way to build a tribe of fans and customers that are loyal to your brand. Giving valuable content around the topic, giving customers the ability to have a voice and providing a platform for them to build relationships with other customers who share the same interests is a sure strategy that will stop them from straying to the competition and keep customers loyal to the brand. - Steve Howe, Founder, Yoga LifestylesCMO Lesson: Great lesson here kids re: communities. I would caution however re: the whole aligning with your business part Steve refers to. Of course there has to be some connection but do not make the mistake of using communities to sell. Ever. 3. Be Your Brand Customers like to do business with people they know and like. Successful corporate leaders like Virgin’s Richard Branson and T-Mobile’s John Legere have mastered this, but it applies to entrepreneurs and smaller brands too. With the rise and dominance in social media, it has never been more important to build a personal brand and position yourself as an authority in your space. Also, thanks to social media, it has never been easier. To survive as a business leader in 2018, a strong personal brand is more of a necessity than an option. Show the audience of customers you are trying to appeal to that you relate to them, share the same views and values, and are someone they would want to personally do business with.Create a web presence that is in line with that personal brand and give customers the ability to interact, experience, and engage your brand. Connect with customers and deliver content worth following and sharing on social media to build an ongoing relationship with them. Follow up consistently with direct engagements to give customers the ability to do business with your brand. A personal brand does not have to mean trying to get internet famous or have the most followers online, it means positioning yourself as a credible leader and authority in the specific industry you are most qualified to deliver the most value in. - Vito Glazers, WE TV's Season 1 Mystery Millionaire™, actor and entrepreneurCMO Lesson: Much like the previous tip I like this but there is a caveat to what Vito says. You can't be everything to everyone. So where he says ""Show the audience of customers you are trying to appeal to that you relate to them, share the same views and values..."" stay true to YOURS and YOUR BRAND's values. Don't flip flop to try and appeal to everyone for then you will appeal to no one. 4. Integrate CryptocurrencyTechnology is disrupting everything, even money. Every time there is a massive change, there is opportunity for entrepreneurs. One of the potentially biggest opportunities for forward thinking entrepreneurs in 2018 is integrating the ability to pay with crypto currencies into their e-commerce business models. With Bitcoin and popular “Alt-Coins” like Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin exceeding $300 billion dollars in market cap, that is a lot of money on its own. Then take into consideration that this currency is completely online, and has limited ways that it can be spent, and you get a clearer picture of the opportunity in being in on the ground floor of merchants who are willing to accept these types of currencies. - Mitch Sanders, real estate investor and entrepreneurCMO Lesson: What was once reserved for startups or ""those other companies"" cryptocurrency is becoming more mainstream with brands like Burger King getting in on the action. Just be sure to start with the baby pool vs. diving into the deep end. 5. Let Data DecideToo many online entrepreneurs leave too many variables to chance. When putting together a marketing strategy for an online business in 2018, three things should take the highest priority: Data, Targeting and Analytics. Make sure to measure every aspect of a campaign in a way that can be segmented to give a perspective of what worked and what did not. Every dollar spent on advertising should also be considered a dollar spent on data. Take the time to research the audience, see the way they do business online and find strategic advantages in targeting and interacting with them. Then analyze everything and let the metrics be the guide to success. - Rosen Minchev, business coach and consultantCMO Lesson: The lesson here is if this news to ANY CMO you may want to strongly consider a career change. We all know there is no shortage of data. The challenge has become what to do with all of it: what to do with the data you DON'T need while maximizing the data you DO need. All data is not created equal. Wow, that's pretty profound, huh? 6. Content Is Still KingThere is one main reason people love to be on their computers, tablets and phones, and that is people love to consume content. Everyday 1 billion hours worth of content is watched on YouTube and American consumers spend up to 5 hours per day on their mobile phones. Consumers are programmed to not like ads, but advertising that connects the message of a product or brand to content that customers will love to watch and be excited to share, is going to be one of the most important trends to follow for forward thinking companies in 2018. - Ronnie Sandlin, President, Temet Nosce, LLCCMO Lesson: With all due respect to Mr. Sandlin, content is NOT king. Relevant content is king. It is not only king, it is queen, prince, princess and all the townspeople too! Your content MUST connect with your customers and prospects and given the aforementioned data that is in abundance there is literally no reason to deliver content that is anything but relevant. 7. Artificial Intelligence AI is not new. In fact, you probably already interact with marketing AI on a regular basis when you see ads in search results and on social media. And, 57% of marketers already use AI. However, the use of AI for marketing is only going to grow as the technology improves. It's projected to grow by 53% in the next couple of years. I know there are pros and cons to AI with staunch supporters on each side of the aisle. On one hand machine learning and improved technology can make all our lives better and easier, especially when it comes to dealing with data. On the other hand though there many who fear losing their jobs to a machine or robot. There is no standard pat answer when it comes to AI. The key will be to understand how your particular company or brand can best benefit from it. - Rob Lundquist CMO of Henriksen Butler.CMO Lesson: I don't have a lot to add here other than to reiterate what Mr. Lundquist said. I hear it all the time re: the good and bad side of AI. My fear is that it will become the new 'buzz word' meaning marketers across the globe will rush to jump into the AI pool without taking swimming lessons. Yes that's my second pool analogy if you're keeping score at home. 8. Mobile Video ConsumptionIf your website, and your marketing strategy more broadly, isn't optimized for mobile yet in 2017, 2018 is the year to start. Put simply, search engines will penalize you if your website isn’t mobile friendly. Besides, it’s no secret that consumers spend much of their lives staring at their phones. In 2018, mobile video consumption is expected to grow by 25% (and video consumption is supposed to decline on laptops and desktop computers for the first time ever), so get ahead of the competition now by planning a mobile video strategy. - Brett Juhl CMO of Spacesaver Intermountain.CMO Lesson: This is not a knock on Mr. Juhl whatsoever but it blows my mind that this even has to be said/written in the year 2018. I find it hard to believe there is a marketer in the world right this very second who doesn't realize the magnitude of mobile in every possible manner including video. But while I find hard to believe I also realize it still needs to be said/written which is frightening. "

... before surging to new all-time highs amid December's bitcoin mania.","Jan 12, 2018,10:35am EST","Contrary to popular misconception, female investors aren't less confident or more risk-averse than... [+] their male counterparts-in fact, women typically beat men's portfolio returns in the long run. (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg)","The financial newsletter field has long dominated by men, so it might surprise some that many of the most successful advisors we cover are women; indeed, MoneyShow.com has been built over 3 decades by Kim Githler, herself a pioneer in financial education.  What are the top women advisors recommending now? Here are their best ideas for 2018.Chloe Lutts Jensen, Cabot Dividend Investor CME Group  — my top aggressive idea for 2018 — has been in the news recently because the company just started offering bitcoin futures, allowing speculators to bet on the cryptocurrency’s price without owning it.But we added the stock to our portfolio back in October for longer-term growth and its track record of dividend increases and large special dividends.CME Group owns and operates options, futures and derivatives exchanges, including the world’s largest derivatives exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where investors can trade contracts based on interest rates, stocks, currencies, commodity prices and more.Commodity futures were originally designed to allow commodity producers to hedge against price changes, but are now also widely used for speculation, mostly by institutional investors. This steady expansion of the derivatives market has fueled steady growth at CME Group.Revenues have increased in each of the last five years, by an average of 4% per year. Net income has also increased every year, by an average of 11% per year. The company has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters.CME Group not only pays regular quarterly dividends, the company also distributes excess cash as a special dividend at the end of each year. This year’s special dividend of $3.50 will more than double the stock’s annual yield. The company has also increased its regular dividend for six years in a row while also bringing their payout ratio down from a high of 66% in 2012 to 51% today.CME Group also boasts a great chart. Its current uptrend started in June 2016, when it broke out of a long base to the upside. The stock rose 40% over the next 17 months, before surging to new all-time highs amid December’s bitcoin mania. While the latest surge will likely be followed by a period of consolidation, longer-term, I expect excellent total returns.Carla Pasternak, Dow Theory Letters' Income Investor Copper and gold miner Freeport-McMoRan is expected to grow earnings per share nearly fivefold this year , another almost 50% in 2018, and more than 70% annually over the next five years.Earnings are forecast to rise mainly in the wake of higher copper prices, which are currently trading at a three-year high at better than $3 a pound. Prices have been trending higher this year as China’s crackdown on its copper smelters to control pollution has increased its reliance on copper imports.A lack of reserves to meet projected demand for copper in the coming years is also pushing prices higher. As the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, with over 50% of revenue derived from copper, Freeport-McMoRan is expected to benefit from higher prices.Uncertainty about the fate of its Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia has been a large overhang for the shares, but the clouds are clearing. Right now, Freeport owns 91% of Grasberg, the world’s second-largest copper mine, and the Indonesian government owns the balance.In an effort to control the country’s natural resources, Jakarta is demanding mining companies get new licenses and build smelters for local production. In response, Freeport said it will sell a 51% interest in the mine to the state if it can retain operating control until 2041. At stake is whether the two parties can agree on price for this interest.Investors are optimistic that the parties are close to closing in on a deal that’s a win-win for all sides. But the shares are still trading at a forward P/E of only 10 times and a 1-year trailing price to earnings growth rate of just 0.5, which leaves room for considerable upside. (A PEG of 1.0 or less represents good value)For almost the last two years, the shares have been dead money. In the last several weeks, however, the technical picture has radically changed. In December, the stock broke out above $17 resistance that had restrained it for almost a year. The next important resistance I see is in the $23-$24 range.Vivian Lewis, Global InvestingMy top pick for conservative investors for 2018 is Templeton Emerging Markets Income Fund, a closed-end yield fund that pays monthly distributions and has $630 million under management.If you buy a fund or ETF invested in U.S. Treasury inflation bonds, you don’t need active managers. This is not the case for emerging market bonds, where skilled management is needed. In this case, Templeton Emerging is actively managed by a team of experienced bond hands.Its top 10 holdings include 9.4% in two Zambian government bonds yielding 8.97% and 5.37% respectively; 5.1% in Kenyan government bonds yielding 6.875%; 4.8% in Senegalese bonds yielding 6.25%. Its top 10 positions account for 36.44% of its portfolio.The fund is also heavily invested in the private sector although its top holding is a government bond, the Philippine Republic 4.2% of 2024 which accounts for 2.9% of the total holdings. Its second-largest and third-largest holdings, both at 2.1%, are private sector debts from Malaysia and India.The fund trades at a 12.35% discount from net asset value. As such, investors can buy $100 of bonds for only $87.50. It cannot issue new shares without a complicated process. Its 
 
Morningstar
 rating is 5 stars for 5-year and 10-year performance.To make sure that a reversal in earnings will not hurt the fund, it retains part of the earnings of its bonds until the end of the year when they are distributed to shareholders. I recently added this closed-end fund to my portfolio, paying $11.65 per share.Elizabeth Harrow, Schaeffer Investment ResearchMicroblogging site 

Twitter
 completed a major restructuring in 2017, and the results so far appear to be promising. Critics of the Tech 2.0 name have always said that the inability to monetize its massive user base is Twitter's biggest issue, but management appears to be figuring that out.The company recently said advertisers have shown significant interest in its live streams (a content area that's rapidly expanding) and Twitter has partnered with high-profile media players like 
 
Bloomberg
 and Buzzfeed to create premium video offerings.The heightened focus on delivering unique content, coupled with the introduction of longer, 280-character tweets, has resulted in higher engagement, according to user stats.And it’s worth pointing out that the newly streamlined Twitter — with no direct competitors in the social media space — remains an attractive potential takeover target for any number of larger rivals.At least one big brokerage firm is buying the bullish prospects for Twitter. In a mid-December note, 
 
J.P. Morgan's
 Doug Anmuth upgraded the shares to Overweight, and predicted a return to revenue growth in 2018.By and large, though, brokerage firms are giving Twitter a wide berth. Out of 37 analysts tracking the stock, 32 have deemed Twitter a Hold or Sell (including one Strong Sell).While these bearishly skewed ratings seem appropriately configured to the security's lengthy period of underperformance on the charts, most brokerage firms have been so far slow to react to the stock’s technical turnaround. Heading into 2018, additional upgrades could drive fresh waves of buying pressure.Linda McDonough, Profit Catalyst Alert

PayPal
 is morphing into a digital and mobile payments gatekeeper. Its software lets consumers fund accounts via credit, debit or bank accounts.PayPal is winning over young customers with its Venmo service. The payment company’s Venmo is a peer-to-peer payment program. Millennials love Venmo. Using physical cash puzzles this generation who prefers to pay via their mobile phones.The service is an app that sits on your phone. It links to your bank account, credit or debit card. To date, it is used mostly to pay another person. Opening Venmo up to retail payments next year will rev up PayPal’s profits.Venmo has become so ubiquitous among younger consumers that it is now a verb. Split a pizza? Venmo your roommate $6.00. Just like texting evolved from a teen-only means of swapping gossip to an all-ages method of communication, the mass market is adopting Venmo.PayPal got the Venmo technology when it bought Braintree Payment Systems in 2013. It saw the magic in Braintree’s peer-to-peer payment system. PayPal spent four years building a mass market.Industry experts estimate that Venmo has 10 million users. None of those users currently pay transaction fees. All the while, PayPal’s basic business blossomed. After PayPal added debit and credit cards to payment choices, user growth rocketed. PayPal’s total active account base grew 14% last quarter.With over 200 million active accounts and close to 10 million Venmo users, the company has the scale to enjoy the network effect. PayPal also offers immediate access to Venmo funds for a $0.25 fee. This seems like a small amount to pay for the convenience. I expect this fee will generate significant revenue for the company.For more investment ideas, click here for ""MoneyShow’s 35th Annual Top Stock Picks Report: The 100 Best Stocks for 2018.""Mary Anne and Pamela Aden, The Aden ForecastThe bull market rise in stocks has been impressive. In fact, the stock market has risen every month in 2017 in its longest streak of monthly gains in 22 years.The commodity market is coming alive. After years of low prices, the stronger global economy means that we’ll likely see far better times in the resource sector as 2018 unfolds.Copper seems to be leading the pack and the future looks bright. With demand growing it’s set to head higher. That’s especially true considering the growing popularity of electric cars and their future growth potential. This alone will keep strong upward pressure on copper.Copper’s technical indicators are also looking good. A renewed strong rise began this past year, reinforcing a solid uptrend since 2001. Also, note the developing up-channel encompassing the 1990s to today.This is bullish technical action and several of the other resources are following copper's lead. Crude oil, for instance, is also strong. With production slowing, we could see the oil price much higher in the months ahead. Considering these factors and more, our top pick is 

BHP Billiton
.This company is one of the biggest resource companies in the world.  And since it deals in a wide variety of resources, it’s a good all-around stock to own in order to benefit from the upcoming strength in this sector.Ingrid Hendershot, Hendershot InvestmentsCelebrating 40 years in business, The TJX Companies — my top conservative pick for 2018 — posted record financial results in fiscal 2017 with sales topping $33 billion.In 1990, TJX acquired Winners, which has grown into Canada’s leading off-price retailer. In 1992, HomeGoods was introduced to expand the TJX  presence in the booming home fashions market.Similarly named T.K. Maxx was launched in 1994 and introduced the off-price concept to the United Kingdom. In 1995, TJX acquired 
 
Marshalls
, which doubled the company’s size. The newest store divisions include HomeSense, Sierra Trading Post and Trade Secrets.TJX delivers a rapidly changing assortment of quality, brand name merchandise at prices that are 20%-60% less than department and specialty store regular pricesAs the largest off-price retailer, TJX has tremendous buying power and solid relationships with more than 18,000 merchandise vendors in 100 countries around the world. This retail recipe engenders strong brand loyalty from global consumers of all ages.Comparable store sales have increased each year for 21 consecutive years. Same-store sales have risen each year over the last four decades with the exception of only one year, a truly remarkable retail achievement.As part of its disciplined capital allocation policy, TJX announced a 20% increase in its dividend for fiscal 2018, marking the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. Over this time period, the dividend has grown at a 23% compound annual rate.Management’s outlook for fiscal 2018 is for total revenues to increase 6% to 7% to $35.2 billion to $35.6 billion, with 1% to 2% comparable store sales growth. The company expects EPS to be up 13%-14% in the range of $3.91 to $3.93 in fiscal 2018, which includes an $.11 per share benefit from a 53rd week in 2018.Long-term investors shopping for a bargain should consider TJX Companies a well-managed high-quality business with strong brand loyalty, outstanding cash flows, steadily growing dividends and substantial share repurchases.

CIT Group
 (CIT) — my conservative pick for 2018 — operates both a bank holding company and a financial holding company that provide financing, leasing and advisory services to small-market and middle-market businesses, consumer markets, and the real estate and railroad industries.Financial companies occupy the sweet spot in America’s growing economy. Rising interest rates, lower income tax rates (both corporate and personal) and deregulation all serve to increase banks’ revenue and net income.However, the news gets better. There’s bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate to change SIFI rules as they apply to banks with less than $250 billion in assets. SIFI rules are regulations that apply to systemically important financial institutions.The stock market has not factored in potential SIFI changes. However, there’s a new and highly unusual administration in Washington, D.C. that’s pushing for reform. As such, I think the long list of proposed SIFI rule changes is going to see some serious action. And that will directly benefit the profitability of small-cap and mid-cap financial institutions.CIT Group is expected to achieve attractive earnings per share growth in the coming years. Consensus estimates point toward gains of 17.5% and 19.0% in 2018 and 2019. The corresponding P/E ratios are low, indicating that the stock is undervalued.For the most part, current estimates do not take into account enhancements from the aforementioned economic and legislative changes that are on the immediate horizon.I am confident that CIT Group is well positioned to capitalize on both the growing economy and revised SIFI rules that benefit mid-cap financial institutions. I rate the stock a Strong Buy. "

I sat down with Rich Aberman, cofounder and Chief Strategy Officer of WePay and Rachel Mayer, cofounder and CEO of Trigger, to learn more about their experiences.WePay came onto the scene in 2008 as a staunch competitor to PayPal before shifting their business plan to focus on small business payment processing and APIs. They made waves in 2010 when the founders dropped an ice block full of frozen dollar bills on the steps of the PayPal Developer’s Conference, with a message saying, “PayPal Freezes Your Accounts.” The move led to a 225% increase in signups.As to whether the founders, Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman, designed an exit strategy from the outset, Aberman claims the answer is no. “For the longest time, we focused entirely on building a large, independent company. We only started to very seriously think about an exit within the last year when the financial and competitive markets heated up,” he said in our interview.The WePay founders met the Chase team at a FinTech conference, and the relationship grew organically from there. Once the conversation turned to acquisition, the deal took about nine months to complete.Trigger was founded less than three years ago by Rachel Mayer after leaving her job in the algorithmic trading division at J.P. Morgan. The company was born out of a startup competition at Cornell University, where Mayer received her Masters in Engineering following a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from MIT. Mayer was frustrated with the lack of financial data she had access to as a free agent, and aimed to create a product for everyday investors who could set alerts, or triggers, to be notified of defined economic signals. The company received a great deal of attention last year with their “Trump Triggers,” letting their investors know when Donald Trump tweeted about a certain stock.Rachel Mayer presents at Morgan Stanley's Multicultural Innovation Lab.Trigger was acquired by Boston-based Circle in October 2017. On whether she planned an exit strategy from the outset, Mayer definitively answers in the affirmative. “We had an exit strategy right from the beginning,” she said in our interview. “We had assumed that because we were so closely integrated with online brokerages, we would probably get picked up by one of the discount brokerage houses given their slow track record of innovation.” As the founders became more familiar with FinTech and the banking industry, Mayer says the team found that banks were more hesitant than expected.“I would caution future FinTech entrepreneurs to not ultimately be so set on big banks buying you. The track record isn’t there yet. Keep an open mind for side verticals or younger growth stage startups,” Mayer advised, though added that, “For FinTech companies with big enough scale - either revenue, users, tech infrastructure or IP - banks will start to open up to the idea of acquisition and brand building through these companies fairly soon. Especially now, with the extra equity they’ve built in the latest market rally.  If I were in corporate development at a bank I would be looking to buy right now. ”As to how startups can position themselves for acquisition, Mayer says, “A startup should have figured out the customer funnel, audience capture and retention. I’m not as bullish on wealth management acquisitions as I am insurance, personal finance and pure infrastructure plays.”Remember, financial institutions avoid risk at all costs.“Regulated financial institutions and banks are always going to have an aversion to anything that imposes risk, regulatory or reputational,” said Aberman. “They aren’t going to be the ones to push the envelope in today’s digital world.“That creates an opportunity for FinTech companies to step up and really drive innovation. But don’t be tempted to sell before you’re ready, says Mayer. “You will get temptations to chat with corporate development and it is exciting, but deals fall apart very quickly and most of the time they are trying to learn about you - so I would follow the ‘don’t talk to corporate dev’ rule until you are absolutely sure now is the right time to exit your company.”Don’t think selling will happen fast, though, Mayer says:  “It will take longer than you think.” "

Represented by Harmeet K. Dhillon, the Republican National Committee’s committeewoman for California, the pair is also seeking class-action status for the suit to include anyone at the company who identities as Caucasian, conservative or male.According to the suit, Damore was laughed at and insulted before being fired from the company, while ""Google executives and employees condemned Damore, his memo, and his views."" See also: 14-Year-Old Charged With Felony Sex Crime For Sending A Dirty SelfieIn August, Damore wrote and circulated a memo, entitled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber,"" that went viral within the company and later on the wide web beyond. Known today as 'the Google Memo, the document criticized aspects of Google's corporate-directed culture and diversity practices and cited behavioral data and Damore's own experiences to argue, among other things, that women are biologically unsuited for engineering work.Following widespread backlash over the document, Google CEO Sundar Pichai fired Damore and broadly rebuked his theories about women and diversity, which itself caused controversy and led to fiery debates about free speech at work. Damore publicly criticized Pichai's actions and subsequently went on a publicity tour around the country for conservative and/or alt-right audiences.Now, with his intended class action, Damore has surged back into the mainstream spotlight in a move that has tech insiders scratching their heads (or, in some cases, shaking them).See also: Cut Off From Big Fintech, White Nationalists Are Using Bitcoin To Raise Funds A picture taken on November 20, 2017, shows logos of U.S. multinational technology company Google...

Bitcoin ...","Jan 30, 2018,05:44pm EST","With all of the hype surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrencies over the course of 2017, there seems to be less chatter surrounding the Internet of things (IoT) lately.","Despite the comparative lack of buzz, IoT actually had quite a year. Improvements in sensor and connectivity technologies have pushed IoT adoption beyond consumer electronics. More IoT devices found their way into verticals such as manufacturing and logistics. According to Gartner, more than 36% of IoT devices (around 4.2 billion) will be used for business applications by 2018. By 2025, McKinsey estimates that IoT can create more than $11 trillion in economic value.However, it’s not merely the appeal of smart devices drawing businesses towards IoT. Many are focused on taking advantage of the explosion of useful data that IoT is expected to generate. Data is now considered a commodity, or the “new oil,” as some claim. In anticipation, businesses such as those in data and analytics and even blockchain are now intent on becoming integral parts of the IoT ecosystem.While data becomes the ""new oil"" and the gold rush for cryptocurrencies is at it's pick, IoT and... [+] blockchain are two buzz words that could potentially contribute to it's other's growth. Analytics and data based predictions could utilize blockchain technologies to create a more secure, data driven, IoT eco system. Connecting people and devices.

Even consulting services like Accenture are shoring up their capabilities in anticipation of the growing adoption of IoT in enterprises.In addition to the analytics crowd, blockchain advocates are now also figuring into IoT. Blockchain-based data streaming platform Streamr, for example, aims to break down the barriers to access IoT data streams through a decentralized data marketplace. IOTA, which is developing its own open-source distributed ledger is envisioned to allow machine-to-machine transactions in which IoT devices will be able to pay each other directly.These applications help create a more dynamic ecosystem that could further bolster IoT adoption.Distilling Data to InsightsIoT promises exciting developments for data and analytics. The growth of IoT is expected to greatly ramp up big data’s “Three V’s”: velocity, variety and volume. Many expect that this deluge of raw data will become a gold mine. However, much like real-world commodities, data can greatly benefit from being processed and refined. Data is just characters and numbers unless translated to actionable insights.Think about the wealth of health data that the companies behind fitness monitor devices such as Fitbit and Garmin have already collected. At a basic level, the data is only used to provide their users with information about their daily exercise accomplishments. However, data can serve bigger purposes beyond such applications. For example, Fitbit aims to monetize their 90 billion hours of heart rate data by opening it up to healthcare use cases. Fitness data can be used by other groups working on disease prevention and medical breakthroughs. When used right, data can even help save lives.Analytics and business intelligence tools must greatly improve to keep pace with the IoT data deluge. Speed and scalability are essential to IoT analytics. This is why infrastructure providers seek to leverage their command of vast computing resources to enable businesses to readily deal with this data boom.Complementary technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can also help further automate and shorten the path to better insights. IBM, for instance, has been improving upon their Bluemix cloud and Watson AI platforms to better equip enterprises with the resources and agility to cope with these new demands. And when more people have access to data-driven insights, the opportunities for business growth likewise expand.Decentralizing IoT Data ConsumptionAs such, IoT data can truly have world-changing implications. This, however, brings up the matter of data access and ownership, which has been a growing concern, especially given the surge of the social web, user-generated content and “the quantifiable self.”Most users of digital services essentially cede their information to large companies. These companies then use the data to drive their own business strategies or even sell it to other parties. Unfortunately, this fixation on monetization compels these organizations to silo their data, often under the guise of privacy concerns. Such restrictive and centralized approach to data can limit potential breakthroughs.Streamr uses blockchain to democratize access to IoT data through data streaming. Using the platform, device owners can stream data through its peer-to-peer network. These streams are then made available for consumption to other users through a decentralized data marketplace. Exchange is made using crypto tokens and transactions are recorded on the blockchain.Developers and researchers get access to a wide assortment of data streams, which could lead to quicker discoveries and innovation. It also gives data owners control over who gets to use their data and, at the same time, be compensated for what they share. This essentially creates an equitable economy for owners and consumers of IoT data.IOTA is another attempt at using decentralization for IoT. Though typically been lumped together with other blockchain projects, IOTA doesn’t exactly use blockchain technology. It is designed as a cryptocurrency that IoT devices can use for machine-to-machine transactions.An iPhone is seen with a bitcoin price graph and the IOTA logo in the background, in this photo... [+] illustration on December 15, 2017. Bitcoin has been scrutinized recently for its difficulty in scaling, its costly transactions and lengthy confirmation times. With its new DAG technology IOTA claims to overcome these hurdles while serving an IoT driven ecosystem, at the same time, critics point out their own scaling issues which might serve as a glass ceiling to it's growth. (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Core to its technology is the Tangle – a blockless distributed ledger that provides immutable recording of IoT data. In addition, Tangle operates without the need for miners, so IOTA transactions don’t get charged with fees unlike other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. IOTA could potentially enable smart cars to directly pay toll booths and charging stations, or even for smart refrigerators to order and pay delivery drones. Devices may eventually even be able to buy and sell data directly, among themselves.Interestingly, these services’ varying approaches highlight an interesting concern regarding IoT data storage. The volume and velocity of data that sensors send out can strain conventional storage solutions. On one hand, data streaming fits use cases where real-time data is needed. Acquiring data on-demand through a service like Streamr can be a way to circumvent the need for storage.On the other, data has to be stored in order to perform historical analyses and generate further insight from it. The distributed storage offered by blockchain and crypto services may theoretically be able to provide vast amounts of space. Still, computing resources have their own costs. In the case of IOTA, it has been pointed out that its fee-less approach can potentially create a storage problem in the long-term, as the genesis node grows in size.Creating Synergy in the EcosystemThese services may contribute to the growth of IoT, but they may also test the synergy of the ecosystem. The storage conundrum is just one of IoT’s issues but it’s an issue that an evolving ecosystem may be able to sort out. There must be a conscious effort among players to create a more supportive ecosystem rather than a highly competitive and even predatory one. IoT and data are bound to face further challenges, overcoming these requires synergy.Concerns regarding speed and scalability of IoT analytics have already emerged. Aside from improvements in the way larger amounts of data can be crunched and turned into insights, other solutions are also being pushed. Edge analytics, for example, can complement consolidated business intelligence efforts by pre-processing data within the device or somewhere on-site. This lessens the burden of storage and the need for more computing power to handle and process the data.Security is also becoming an issue. Mirai, one of the largest botnets that carry massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that took down critical internet services over the past year, uses hijacked IoT devices that lacked proper security protocols.Solving these, hinge on further improvements in IoT engineering. Devices must be equipped with more powerful hardware to handle additional computational load. Infrastructure must also improve to provide more bandwidth to effectively connect these devices.ConclusionData, analytics and crypto services are making data more useful for everyone. Fascinating as new developments are, it is important to note that these are just a fraction of the budding IoT ecosystem. Developments are also taking place in hardware, security, and infrastructure.It is about time people will start paying attention to the big picture implications of IoT. While only time will tell how initiatives like these will pan out, they do surely highlight the exciting possibilities of the future."

Year after year security vendors compile data to produce annual reports summarizing the threat landscape from the previous 12 months, and—almost without fail—the threats increase. The new Malwarebytes Cybercrime Tactics and Techniques: 2017 State of Malware Report is no exception.First, if you’re not familiar with Malwarebytes, you probably should be. It may not be as widely known as Symantec, McAfee, Webroot, and other antimalware vendors, but it is definitely well-known among those who work in tech and cybersecurity. Malwarebytes is often the go-to tool you use when you want to doublecheck to make sure those household name antimalware tools didn’t miss anything.Malwarebytes compiled data from its honeypots, gather from January to November of 2016 and January to November of 2017 to produce the latest report.

transfers of value, blockchain technology can record supply chain ...","Editors' Pick|Feb 1, 2018,01:57pm EST",Hollywood and the music industry have traditionally controlled access and distribution. (Credit:... [+] FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images),"Although blockchain technology remains far from mainstream adoption, it is poised to change the status quo in a wide range of fields. In this article, I want to focus on one industry that could be particularly positioned for disruption – entertainment.The State of Content Creation and ConsumptionArguably more so than any other industry, entertainment has a gatekeeper problem. Until recently, it was impossible to put out music without getting a record deal and relying on a label to record, distribute, and monetize your music as an artist. The same was true in film and television: You could not distribute a movie or TV show without studios and production companies throwing their weight behind you, and movie theaters or cable channels agreeing to showcase your creation.While the internet has now democratized content creation and distribution in entertainment and creatives no longer have to get in bed with the likes of Interscope or Disney, a new crop of middlemen have emerged in digital content. Today, users rely on platforms to consume music and video content. Platforms like YouTube (1.5 billion users), SoundCloud (175 million), Spotify (140 million) and Netflix (~110 million) control user consumption across the globe and act as the new distributors, responsible for both collecting subscription and ad revenues and divvying up payments to artists.This amount of control favors the major labels and streaming platforms, and has led to disputes around artist compensation and treatment, most famously Taylor Swift vs. Apple Music and Spotify. As artists grow increasingly disillusioned with these platforms, they are looking for new options. Enter the blockchain.By offering a digital public database that stores an ongoing record of transactions, the blockchain has given companies the ability to have completely encrypted records of ownership, as well as execute smart contracts (i.e. automatically enforce the exchange of anything of value without the need for a middleman). There are currently several attempts to create blockchain-based companies and currencies of relevance to media and entertainment. When applied to media consumption this technology solves the problems surrounding content access, distribution and compensation; managing assets and digital rights; and financing, among others.Musician Imogen Heap released the first song on the Ethereum blockchain. (Credit: Kevin Mazur/One... [+] Love Manchester/Getty Images for One Love Manchester)Arguably the main problem blockchain has solved, at least when it comes to content consumption, is micropayments. While platforms such as Patreon are focused on helping creators raise money from their fans, these platforms are still in the middle as a facilitating platform. The use of cryptocurrencies helps eliminate any and all middlemen by securing payment and reducing transaction costs, freeing up a greater portion of each sale for the creator.Grammy winner Imogen Heap is one of the most prominent musicians to embrace the blockchain. She recently teamed up with Ujo, a company looking to be the one-stop shop for independent music distribution and payments, to release the first song on the Ethereum blockchain. The concept of smart contracts is at the core of Ethereum and allowed Heap to enjoy absolute control over how she and her collaborators on the track were paid and under what circumstances (e.g., buying licenses to download, stream, remix and sync the song).A company building out the necessary platform for blockchain-based payments is Stem, which hopes to be the payment distribution platform for creators. They allow creatives to publish content, manage contracts and transact payments all from one easy-to-use portal. While micropayments are far from the norm in content consumption today, a promise of lower transaction fees and more secure records of sale and consumption could make it an interesting business model for artists, authors and filmmakers.Continue reading...The blockchain guarantees the right people get credit for their work. Credit: ShutterstockBlockchain also holds great promise for that erstwhile cousin of micropayments: digital rights management. The history of producing and selling content is a long scuffle over who owns the rights to the content, from Britain enacting the world’s first copyright law in 1709 to Napster and BitTorrent in the recent past.Blockchain technology, with its immutable record-keeping and decentralized nature, presents a solution. The big players have sat up and noticed: Spotify, which had to settle a lawsuit over unpaid royalties last year, recently acquired Mediachain, a digital rights management startup. Mediachain combines blockchain infrastructure with content ID tech similar to that found in a Google image search to create a “universal media library” in which you can identify the ""author and story"" behind a piece of content.Tangible GoodsWhat about the tangible goods involved in entertainment: celebrity merchandise, event tickets, or memorabilia? Leonardo Da Vinci’s Salvator Mundi painting shattered the record for a painting sale by more than 200% when it sold for $450m not a month ago; and the average Super Bowl 51 ticket fetched nearly $5000. There is a cousin of the “superstar effect” at work here: Instead of the best performers reaping greater gains due to their ability to reach a broader market, however, the broadened ability of the market to reach a piece of content drives value to scarcity - or authenticity.And blockchain has great potential for keeping the authentic, authentic. Similarly to how Bitcoin uses an immutable ledger that records peer-to-peer transfers of value, blockchain technology can record supply chain transactions or provide a unique identity to each unit of product, tracing its journey on the chain. The unit can be paired with a NFC chip, QR code, or RFID tag that logs its real-world progress in the digital world. VeChain is a Shanghai-based startup that is already working on this problem as it relates to luxury handbags. One can imagine the same techniques being applied to celebrity merchandise. In the UK, BitTicket has launched a blockchain-based platform that manages the sale of public event tickets and aims to tamp down on ticket scalping.Aventus and TicketChain are competitors. Everledger, a company that first rose to prominence applying blockchain solutions to the problem of diamond sourcing, has waded into the murky world of fine arts to combat fraud there. This makes sense given the price tag on that Da Vinci - you’d hate to be the Saudi prince who discovers you’re the owner of the most expensive fake in history, a la The Thomas Crown Affair.GamingThe past few weeks have made it impossible to avoid talking about this application of blockchains. That inevitability is almost entirely due to CryptoKitties (“the future is meow!”), a digital kitten trading game running on the Ethereum blockchain. TechCrunch described it both as a “digital version of Pokemon cards” and a decentralized Neopets. Since launching on November 28, the situation has escalated quickly: More than $6.3m had been spent on the site as of December 6, 2017; it is choking the Ethereum blockchain; and kitties have gone for more than six figures. Of course, it also handily serves as a Rorschach test for people with thoughts on blockchain. Which is to say, everyone: It’s evidence of blockchain’s scaling issues. Its easy comparison to Beanie Babies serves as a warning about blockchain’s bubbly characteristics. It’s a “tongue-in-cheek critique of the ICO market today,” according to its marketing director.Whatever else it is, it’s the first significant gaming application on a blockchain. Unlike Neopets, CryptoKitties does not use a centralized database. Though its developers, AxiomZen, take a cutof every transaction on the game, the company could disappear tomorrow and the kitties would still be tradable. The breakout success of CryptoKitties will draw more attention and financing to game development on blockchains, and there are other projects poised to benefit. Game Protocol stands out for its scope and ambition: it recently launched an ICO after building a protocol that encompasses an entire videogame economy, including a decentralized game store, a developer community along with tools for creating games, and a crowdfunding platform for consumers to fund projects they like. Everything from esports betting to card games has seen iterations based on blockchain.There is no doubt the blockchain offers numerous exciting applications to solve problems that have plagued the entertainment industry for decades. Stay tuned for my next piece on the role of the blockchain in the future of social media and content."

representing a rise of over $3,100 in one week alone. This marks a ...","Jan 24, 2018,08:57am EST","Russell S. King is the founder of Paycasso, a FinTech company that specializes in combating identity fraud through the use of innovative facial recognition and computer learning technology.","Paycasso is currently expanding into Africa and has already signed on a number of African financial institutions to utilize its facial recognition technology and other products.2018 will mark a year of unbridled transparency.  Our personal information, including detailed financial and health related records, is more likely than not to fall prey to a system breach ultimately available for a price to those with nefarious intent.As the use of e-identity mechanisms broadens, our landing visas, financial statements, and/or our healthcare records have become examples of our digital fingerprints, in need of consistent safeguard.I recently caught up with Russell S. King in Johannesburg to find out what it takes to defend against reputational risk and safeguard identity itself in this ‘brave new world’. He spoke to me about how identification can be a force for good, used to facilitate financial inclusion and foster opportunity for emerging market economies and their citizens.Russell KingTell me about the impetus to safeguard consumer identity and also, e-Authenticity as the future of confident finance. Prior experiences as CEO of a US Healthcare company and a rather unique position within the ICANN community led to my founding Paycasso in 2012. Both roles had afforded me two terribly different commercial vantage points which shed light on substantial disconnects in the B2B relationship.The consequences of these disconnects were felt across the consumer demographic, and hold a direct side effect to technical innovation within financial services, healthcare and other regulated consumer industries.Frankly, there were several ‘unanswereds’ – B2C service organisations suffered significant information gaps - who exactly they were working for (or with), who they may or may not have sensitive data on-file for, who specifically is requesting a loan, for instance, and how in particular one can determine likely repayment performance.e-Authenticity, as you put it, demands holistic, accountable solutions. e-Authenticity is paramount to doing business safely and securely in the modern era.A positive influence should be a guiding principal to those afforded a position of influence in shaping an industry. Whilst I appreciate such a statement invites accusations of self-aggrandizing, the core operating principals that define Paycasso’s proposition and are inherent to our solutions have afforded the company broad recognition through private sector deployment and to the best of our knowledge, unique market approval from within the public sector. We acknowledge the privilege of a leading role in the ‘e-Authenticity’ and ‘e-Identity’ industry and apply this principal in our delivery of solutions that effectively streamline the on-boarding and customer verification process. These solutions are simple to use, applying a consistent verification standard across clients’ digital and in-person consumer engagement channels, mitigating money laundering and impersonation fraud risks whilst supporting a primary operational requirement, compliance with regulatory obligations. Our technology platform employs image recognition, machine learning and facial recognition capabilities. Such capabilities enable a broad range of transactional use cases (including e-visas and mobile wallets), maintaining sufficient flexibility to adapt to an ever-growing array of required commercial risk management policies and procedures.Our suite of services enables our clients to effectively manage consumer identity verification requirements, whether such transactional requirements take place over mobile devices, online, or indeed in-person, delivering a positive user experience that isn’t impeded by extensive instruction that results in user friction and frustration. In short, marrying transactional and identity verification solutions drives widespread and positive impacts for our clients, enables truly collaborative engagement and deployment models, delivering choice and confidence for both the client entity and the consumer; transparent risk management enables service providers to deliver the broadest range of accessible services.Paycasso’s patented product portfolio consists of four solutions, each operating model fulfilling clearly defined objectives in addressing organizational, consumer and investor risks represented by money laundering and impersonation fraud throughout the customer lifecycle.We know facial recognition technology has become much more advanced in recent years; can you give us a brief indication of how this works and what makes Paycasso different than other competitors?Facial recognition technology utilizes algorithms that assess and measure facial features. Paycasso solutions generate a feature rich and factual set of data points that collectively define a level of risk associated with the identity represented in a given transaction. The facial recognition component contributes to this risk assessment but this is far from its determining factor. Facial recognition or indeed any biometric modality, in our opinion, cannot in isolation purport to deliver identity verification.To further elaborate on this position, Paycasso’s VeriSure solution meets the core requirements that support identify verification through a combination of the user’s attributes and the various risk levels represented by those attributes. Capturing, verifying and authenticating a Government Issued Photo ID is a reliable control in helping mitigate impersonation fraud risk, however, ensuring that the ID belongs to the individual is also a crucial control. This process historically required human judgment that is prone to inconsistency and error, with variable degrees of scrutiny and due diligence. VeriSure combines these processes into a single, automated and ultimately consistent operating model.It is a combination of the efficiency and transparency in applied processes, coupled with detailed and factual transaction reporting that enables comprehensive, client-defined decision-making. These are the ultimate values that our clientele find compelling in our distinction.DocuSure™, InstaSure™ and IdentiSure™ make up the balance of the product portfolio.  InstaSure™ and IdentiSure™ leverage our core biometric competency to deliver respectively: a) identity authentication that confirms the ‘live’ user biometrically matches the facial record that was captured and verified when the account was originated; and b) assesses whether a user already exists within account records which would further identify duplicate and potentially fraudulent account records using the face as the identifier.Though distinct in approach and application, each of these products seamlessly integrates across our clients’ digital and in-person channels. Identity verification is an important financial crime control, acting as a barrier to entry for any financial institution however, it is only one part of a financial crime control model - the information obtained through the Paycasso product suite is effectively leveraged to manage enterprise-wide financial crime risks (for example, transaction monitoring).Much like the security systems you experience at border control points and e-gates, speed is essential to the consumer experience during financial transactions, whether they are applied in account opening, real-time purchases or monetary transfers.The stakes are high. In the U.S., for example - According to a Federal Reserve Payments Study, Americans used credit cards to pay for USD$26.2 billion purchases in 2012 alone. The estimated loss due to unauthorized transactions that very year was USD $6.1 billion.And so in the era of digital commerce, e-identity software provides the opportunity for retailers in the United States, the United Kingdom, across Europe, Africa and around the world, to grow their consumer bases by offering ease of process. To our clients operating in a multitude of markets and service offerings, our solutions ensure transparency and comprehensive controls, in all matters of e-Identification.From a competitive intelligence standpoint, we offer choice in the deployed operating model, hands-on expertise and committed support for our clients’ evolving business models; real collaboration for innovations in enhanced security. We are helping our clients improve brand distinction through identity, increase sales, safeguard proprietary and customer information whilst importantly, grow their businesses, many on a multi-national basis.What is the application for digital identity beyond everyday transactions?The industry is effectively demonstrating how biometric technology can be leveraged to elevate secure access to banking information, medical records, purchase history, travel documents and more, reducing reliance on usernames and passwords.For example, losing your passport in a foreign country is a serious problem – It can leave you stranded for days at a time (at the least), ruin predetermined business arrangements and even force incurred fines from your home country on your return. The future of digital identity in alleviating many of the challenges we have historically been obliged to accept is truly bright.Further, ‘trust’, in all aspects of digital commerce, is a fundamental requirement. Transparency is another core Paycasso operating principal. Its primary consideration in our applied technology, process and procedures strive to perpetuate the trust model and its universal application.Indeed today, our client solutions demonstrate broad applicability in meeting bespoke commercial requirements well beyond financial service providers and include healthcare services, retail banking, insurance and restricted goods or services – each being an industry that requires a clear and definable trust model, be it B2B or B2C. Trust is ultimately critical in the handling and use of sensitive information.At present, we are seeing technology create several different digital signatures – Smartphone GPS locations, bank and credit purchases, e-mail history, accommodation confirmations – However, the information attained is still spread out and disjointed in functionality. It is once we combine these various sources that we will be able to cohesively create a fully functional digital identity with branded controls, allowing an individual to access the entirety of their records within mere seconds, and take these records with them safely wherever they may go.Right now, we see the integrated application of facial recognition capabilities in border security, crowd control, travel and banking transactions, but there is no real limit as to how this software can continue to be applied in support of improved information security and efficiency within our daily lives.Lastly, there is an inherent Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in the contribution we can make in expanding inclusion and access to the digital economy and services that ultimately empower individuals i.e. ‘banking the unbanked’ in developing markets in Africa, Eurasia and Latin America (as but examples) through e-identification.Verifying loan applicants or supporting the e-identification process for an individual perhaps previously disconnected from modern financial services, from the emerging markets or otherwise, is an application in which we take great pride in fostering.From the mass distribution of smartphones worldwide, it is truly an honor for Paycasso to play even a small role in connecting men, women and families to the global marketplace and for many, for their first time.Bitcoin prices recently breached USD $11,300 for the first time in history, representing a rise of over $3,100 in one week alone. This marks a stunning boon for cryptocurrencies, despite influential public sector voices echoing concerns about limited regulatory clarity. How do you envision the rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency transactions in general being managed - Would the merits behind facial recognition software be applicable here? Do you agree with the notion of several major governments, including the U.S., in their willingness to regulate the cryptocurrency space rather than outright ban it?It is clear that as a global society we are moving away from reliance on brick and mortar institutions and that individuals are becoming more interested – invested – and connected - in and by digital only financial services and cryptocurrencies.Cryptocurrencies are increasing in scale at a dramatic rate. It has been predicted that Bitcoin could reach USD $40,000 by the end of 2018, and Ethereum, $1,500. These are predictions could well prove to be underestimated. At present, total market capitalization of digital coins is approximately $304 billion, projected to increase up to 6 times that amount by the end of 2018. And so it’s easy to see that globalization and digital currencies are intangibles working hand in hand in bringing mass investment into cryptocurrency markets. Such a market necessitates secure mechanisms to protect people and their transactions.Modern-day commerce, financial technology and perhaps even sustainable development are hinged upon perpetual boons in matters of tech-efficiency. Cryptocurrencies, supported by Digital Financial Services (DFS), will continue to be a driving force.Conversely, in this time of unprecedented interest there continues to be, perhaps for many, a concerning lack of transparency. Cryptocurrency investment confidence is key; technological private sector-driven innovation in tandem with appropriate and effective public sector oversight and regulation are the leading candidates in addressing these concerns.Incorporating e-identity and a trust model into digital currency transactions will deliver safeguards that would elevate risk controls and therefore protections against identity fraud in the marketplace.With the cryptocurrency market remaining relatively unregulated, particularly with respect to Government Monetary Authorities, the identity of the cryptocurrency holder remains largely opaque. Smart technologies that incorporate facial biometrics could very well become increasingly relevant to the market.What do you foresee as the major challenges and opportunities in e-Identity and how do you aim to overcome them at Paycasso in future?First, let’s speak to the challenges as I see them – e-Identity is an evolutionary process. The innovations in authenticity, be it at border controls or within one’s mobile wallet, are consistent only in that technology is always improving.Across the board adoption of this technology and its uniform use in both mature and emerging markets around the world, will no doubt pose additional challenge, one we at Paycasso never shy away from.We then must speak to regulatory environments in those global markets. Ensuring commercial and consumer interests are adequately protected requires a cautious approach to regulatory amendments that address the effective shift from brick and mortar institutional banking and physical currency to remote, mobile banking and technology-driven commerce.And there are very sound reasons for trepidation – dramatic technology driven change, where the delivery and access to financial services is a prime beneficiary, creates significant opportunity for those with nefarious intent. Effective safeguards that adequately consider new and rising threats for both commerce and consumer are essential.Then we must speak to the use of certain high profile technologies. Whilst a number of new technologies lend themselves terribly well to decision making processes and ultimately driving better outcomes for all parties, there are properties that are unique to identity and use of these very same technologies could have significantly different outcomes. Artificial intelligence or ‘A.I’ as an example, is beginning to be represented as a potential ‘game changer in the marketplace. In my opinion, if not appropriately considered and applied, could pose the proposition of a false ‘safety net’, one that could support a viable initial foothold for the scaled use of synthetic identities.Turning to the opportunities in the future, they are abundant. From continued enhancements in person-to-person financial transactions supported with our technology to, and I must stress this, public private partnerships (PPP). We recognized that Regulatory Authorities must be part of the conversation if we were to successfully foster an environment to effect change. Our consistent, open and transparent engagement is critical. Patience and deliberacy in articulating the evidence based proposition and demonstrating efficacy has, in my opinion, garnered a level of trusted authority within this community and in certain cases contributed in resulting to a publicized leadership role for the company. We will continue to make the investment in broadening visibility and our contribution to the public sector.Ultimately, we must all continue to evolve to meet rising demands for technological innovation to thrive. I certainly believe that Paycasso has, in its short history, made a significant contribution to creating the opportunity for real and positive change.

[+] sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, eastern Switzerland, on January 25, 2018. / AFP PHOTO / Nicholas Kamm (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)","David Shrier is a lecturer and futurist at MIT’s renowned Media Lab. For a digital pluralist like myself, the Media Lab, founded by Nicholas Negroponte, is a spiritual home. Negroponte knocked the ball out of the park over 20 years ago with his book “Being Digital” and his regular Wired contribution, and influenced a new digital generation. He was the first academic “rock star” I saw live!David is also an associate fellow with University of Oxford’s Said Business School, where he is helping to reskill the financial services workforce for the digital age through the Oxford Fintech and Oxford Blockchain online programmes.David and I met last year at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. David and his co-author MIT Prof. Alex “Sandy” Pentland were launching their book “Frontiers of Financial Technology” at the Hub Culture pop-up. David and I were verbally downloading at a clip rate that would make Zuckerberg pale. He delivered a contribution to the Industry Sandbox Consultation Report I chaired when CEO at Innovate Finance.Shrier is one of the most prolific academics, writers, and entrepreneurs that I know. With a global focus on innovation, big data, AI, financial services, and cybersecurity, we have a shared passion for a number of domains across digital.He is at WEF again this year so I thought I would take the opportunity to find out about the new book, check on the status of the Oxford University FinTech course he co-convenes, check out what is going on with his big data and analytics start-up, and ask him to give us his views on the hot topics at WEF 2018.Q. Can you tell us about your new book, “New Solutions for Cybersecurity” which is launching next week?A. We are in the midst of a cybersecurity crisis. From India’s entire database of 1.2 billion personal profiles being accessed, to the weaponized artificial intelligence that change the course of the Brexit and US presidential elections, our existing data and technology systems are not proving sufficient to the task of modern society. We need to completely rethink our approach. So Sandy Pentland and I went around to 30 of the brightest minds we could find across MIT, Lincoln Lab, SRI, University of Cambridge, and elsewhere, for a comprehensive look from managerial, technological, and system standpoints as to how we could do it better. It was fun diving into everything from designing a computer chip that is intrinsically hostile to being hacked, to more esoteric topics like the dark web and how to reveal identity of bitcoin holders.Q. The Oxford FinTech programme you have developed for Oxford University which you co-convene with Professor Nir Vulkan has been up and running six months now, why has it been so successful?A. We benefited from a number of factors coming together at the same time. People in financial services (from over 100 countries) are realizing that technology such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics, are going to completely re-shape the industry. Our programme participants want to gain the knowledge and skills to carve out their new roles in this new future. We’ve also had tremendous support from Peter Tufano, the Dean of Said Business School, and his team. He was so excited about the topic, he himself is one of the instructors, along with an array of the leading minds from academia and industry who provide keen insight and frameworks into the fintech revolution.  Finally, the design of the programme itself propels its success: participants walk away with a tangible action plan for implementation.Q. You are the founder and CEO of Distilled Analytics, a big data and analytics play focused on a new breed of credit risk assessment and other types of behavioral analytics. What’s the secret sauce and where is the play going next?A. We are commercializing research from leading academic institutions including MIT, Oxford, and Imperial College, providing fundamental insight into what people are going to do with their money and even who they are. This advanced behavioral analytics allows us to offer credit solutions that are superior to the existing SME and consumer lending models, digital identity solutions that can improve a bank’s ability to comply with AML/KYC by three orders of magnitude (yes, 1000% better), and other applications. We’ve got an amazing team of professionals, and are now starting to deploy our solutions with financial institutions in 2018.Q. What are your top takeaways from this year’s WEF on digital and fintech?A. My top three takeaways are:Overall, the attitude here in Davos is definitely more positive and optimistic than it was last year, as people have processed the Trump election and have decided to either get on with it themselves in taking on the problems that they feel he and the U.S are not. Conscious capitalism and responsible innovation are much more top of mind."

cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which was up around 1,400% in 2017."" 3.","Jan 28, 2018,10:41am EST","American pop star Prince performing at Wembley, London, 22nd August 1990. (Photo by Graham... [+] Wiltshire/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)","To borrow a phrase from Prince, in 2018 investors are partying like it's 1999.Prince released his song about celebrating before the millennium in October 1982. So he did not realize that stocks would enjoy a big surge in 1999 -- that was the year the NASDAQ soared 85.6% -- before collapsing in 2000.For those who don't believe they can wait another eight years for the next market peak, this is a great time to sell.Here are five reasons I reached that conclusion.1. We are overdue for a correctionStocks do not keep going up forever -- and it has been about eight years since the bottom of the last correction.A quick review of the periodic financial and market collapses that capitalism is heir to suggests that we are due for another one.After a decade of inflation, the Fed raised short-term rates to as high as 20% in 1979 and 1980 after inflation had spiked to double-digit rates -- which led to a painful recession and a stock market correction -- followed by a big drop in inflationary expectations.Next came the Reagan tax cuts, deregulation -- particularly of the Savings & Loan industry, the rise of junk-bond-fueled takeovers, and too much borrowing to finance commercial real estate followed by financial and stock market collapses in 1988 and 1992.In the 1990s we enjoyed the dot-com bubble that peaked in 1999 and suffered through the bursting of the bubble followed by a further economic decline in 2001 and 2002 in the wake of 9/11 and the collapse of Enron.And it was a mere decade ago that the entire global financial system came close to freezing up in the wake of the subprime mortgage securitization collapse before the U.S. government stepped in with its $23.7 trillion worth of bailouts and guarantees that set the stage for the last eight years of steady -- if un-thrilling -- economic and stock market recovery.To wit, the S&P 500 has risen since its March 2009 low of 700 at a 16.7% compound annual rate. That compares very favorably to the long-run average 7% rate of return on stocks.2. Recent inflow of feverish retail money into stocksThe steady rise in stocks over the last eight years has not seeped into popular culture the way dot-com stocks did in the 1990s.But the recent inflow of retail cash suggests that this is changing. According to the Wall Street Journal, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, and Charles Schwab ""reported surges in client activity at the end of 2017 that have accelerated in January. The firms attributed much of the activity to retail, or individual, investors who are opening brokerage accounts for the first time, some of them lured by the boom in cryptocurrency and cannabis investments.""The money flows tell the story. In the week ending January 24, investors put $33.2 billion into global stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds -- ""the biggest inflows for any comparable stretch going back to 2002, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch."" What's more, the Journal noted, investors poured ""almost $258 million combined into 10-day-old ETFs that buy companies that have invested in blockchain.""I have no doubt that cryptocurrency investors are thinking that they are smarter than people who doubt them. After all, even though the Dow rose in 2017 at record speed from to 20000 to 26000, the Journal noted that as of January 26, ""Stock gains pale in comparison to gains in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which was up around 1,400% in 2017.""3. Retail money flowing in comes from investors not burned by dot-com bustWhy do people fall for these ""opportunities""? When I worked for a bank in the early 1990s, I was trying to help keep my employer from collapse after it had made too many bad loans in categories like leveraged buyouts and commercial real estate.That was when I learned an important lesson. Pouring money into such lending categories is driven by lending officers who have not lived through previous collapses overseen by managers who should know better -- but realize that if they don't follow the crowd, they will be left behind when bonus time comes.Many of those retail investors were children during the dot-com era. ""Schwab Chief Executive Walt Bettinger said retail business rose 49% in 2017 from a year earlier, with more than half of new clients age 40 or younger,"" according to the Journal.4. Surge in valuations to pre-crash levelsMy guess is that stocks are going to keep rising steadily as the inflow of retail funds keeps chasing ever-higher prices. For now, the S&P 500's Price/Earnings ratio, according to Yale economics professor Robert Shiller, is about 35 -- which is way above the average of about 17.But it falls far short of the levels that marked previous peaks. For example, in December 199, Shiller's P/E peaked at 44 before collapsing. And in 2007, the P/E was a mere 27 plunging to around 15 at the 2009 bottom.Today's P/E of 35 has gone almost straight up from around 25 over the last year or so -- this slope looks just as steep as the one that presaged the collapse of the dot-com bubble.I would not be surprised if the rapid inflow of retail cash continues to propel the steep rise in the P/E up to -- if not higher -- than the previous peak of 44.5. Earnings growth cannot justify spiking P/E ratioWhile the spike in the P/E ratio seems high, is it possible that it's justified by rapid earnings growth?One way to answer that is to look at the Price/Earnings to Growth (PEG). If the PEG is below 1.0, stocks are under-valued, if they are way over 1.0 they are over-valued.Sadly for investors, the PEG is a whopping 2.1. How so? I divided the current Shiller P/E ratio of 35 by 2018 S&P 500 earnings growth of 16.4% from $131.78 in 2017 to $153.42 in 2018, from Yardeni Research. It does not help matters that earnings growth in 2019 is expected to slow to 10.1%, according to Yardeni.The one saving grace of the current melt-up is that cryptocurrency has not led to massive amounts of borrowing -- according to Bloomberg -- and I'd guess that there has not been a potentially economy-crippling amount of borrowing against cannabis.By contrast 2007's bubbly asset class -- subprime mortgages -- fueled massive borrowing which caused the economy to collapse when the loans would not be repaid.Since I have remained invested in stocks during previous financial and market collapses, I plan to do so now. But if I was confident that I would not have the eight years I'd need to recover from that collapse, I would sell my stocks to those retail investors now piling in."

But not anymore. Enter Washington, D.C.-based startup goARTful, a subscription-based service looking to democratize the art world by connecting art lovers with photography, paintings, and drawings from local artists at prices they can afford.The concept for goARTful came from cofounder and co-CEO Messay Derebe’s “desire to start collecting artwork and very quickly realizing that for someone like me, a young professional, living in an expensive city like D.C. there weren't many financially feasible options to explore and purchase art.” To support its mission, goARTful has a tiered ($15, $29, $50) subscription model to explore the work of local artists by borrowing prints or original paintings and photography. If they like the art, they also have the option to buy pieces they like.  “There are thousands of people who pass by art they like in galleries, festivals, or art fairs and keep walking past because they might be intimidated by the idea of buying art, can't afford it, are uncertain of how to start collecting, move frequently and so can't justify an investment in art, or are not sure how a given piece will fit their space,” Derebe said. Derebe explained that beyond feeling isolated “making a living from one's art requires not just creating amazing work, but also successfully marketing and promoting your work. For artists who aren't working with a gallery or art dealer, it can be very challenging to identify ways to generate revenue.” For the artists involved, goARTful’s subscription model generates income and gives them the ability to use the goARTful platform to promote their work. “It’s a marketing tool for our partner artists, helping them to build their businesses, learn new skills, and reach new buyers without having to do all the legwork themselves,” Derebe said. “Something I’ve learned is so helpful is to remember your mission. When you inevitably need to change course, circle back to the mission and ask, will this chance allow me to better achieve my mission?” Derebe explained. “Keep coming back to what you are passionate about and why you started doing what you are doing... it is the only real thing that will keep you going when it gets difficult.”goARTFUL Launch Event"

[+] Dallas, CMO. Also Tizzy, the jackhuahua.","When Chaz Englander first tried setting up an office space in the U.K., he was surprised at how much equipment he needed, from ladders for painting the walls to speakers for the opening party. More surprising however was just how hard it was rent the equipment he wanted only for a short time. He'd have to buy it all himself.“All these things are so hard to get access to. It was just so hard,” Englander told Forbes.That’s why he started a rental marketplace called Fat Lama along with two friends, Rosie Dallas and Owen Turner-Major.If the story sounds familiar, it’s because many sharing economy startups began with a similar frustration. Fat Lama, though, wants to prove that its fate will be different.The idea of a marketplace where people rent or share their unused items lying around the house has long been seductive to entrepreneurs. The hard part has been turning the idea into a business. While plenty of neighbors have spare ladders in the garage or an extra suitcase in the closet, the challenge is in connecting people who need the equipment to the person who has it in the moment they need it on scale, with each rented item covered by insurance.It’s a challenge so difficult that in 2015, after a bevy of startups failed to turn the idea into anything more than a concept, Fast Company declared the sharing economy deadFounded in 2016, Fat Lama is giving it another go. The London-based team of 13 spent the last year expanding rapidly throughout the U.K. and, in January, launched in New York, its first U.S. market. Fat Lama has also raised over $3 million in venture funding from Y Combinator and Greylock, two early backers of Airbnb. (The startup’s unusual spelling of llama is the result of a typo a designer made on its logos, which the team then decided they liked.)“The categories that have exploded for us are the creatives and the creative industries,” Englander said. “Our average item value is about $1,800.”In other words, a lot more valuable than borrowing the neighbor's $30 drill.Listings on Fat Lama’s site range cameras and drone equipment to musical instruments. Lenders feel comfortable renting out high-ticket belongings because Fat Lama insures up to $30,000 per rented item at no additional charge for either lenders or renters.Anyone interested in renting the equipment has to set up a meeting with the lender to pick it up, and that human connection (like finding a new bandmate through a neighbor down the street) has been one of the most rewarding results of the website, says Englander.People put in requests for items in New York on Fat Lama.Fat Lama also has a special feature called “Live Search,” which shows rental requests in real time. On Monday in New York, people were looking for everything from skis and bitcoin mining equipment to a baby crib. The constantly updated stream of temporary needs has some lenders returning to the page multiple times a day, hoping to get their items in the hands of renters as soon as possible, Englander said.“We wanted to put these searches that are being unfulfilled in the public eye,” he said. “It’s just incredible how people have taken to it to see whether anyone is looking for something.”The appeal to a variety of communities, from creative artists to parents with extra baby equipment to spare, has helped the company grows its item listings to over 25,000 in the last year. Some London lenders are earning nearly $5,000 a month renting out their underused equipment, the company says. Now Englander hopes that expanding in the U.S. will see as much success.“The business got to the stage where the income it was generating for the individual got to a level where it became really meaningful,” Englander said. “Every day is like a record number of users, listings, and revenue.”"

[+] (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)But what if our most important social movements needed litigation to bring real financial consequences? Lawsuits, including class actions and individual cases, have a history of catalyzing change. From Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954 and the lawsuits linking Big Tobacco to cancer in the 1980’s and 1990’s to the much more recent lawsuits that exposed Silicon Valley sexism and sexual harassment, a public lawsuit allows people to speak truth to power.At Legalist, we angel invest in the justice system. We pay for legal fees and own a portion of the lawsuit’s recovery. While legal costs can often be prohibitively expensive for individuals or small businesses, litigation funding helps give those cases their day in court. In 2018, there are a lot of things to fight for, and the court system has proven more powerful than ever in safeguarding the rights of women, minorities, and the underdog.The best litigation surprises us, and exposes wrongdoing we didn’t already know about. Below is a list of the litigation we’d most like to see funded in 2018 — all of which reflect directly the type of world we’d like to see.Police Brutality #BlackLivesMatter isn’t over as long as police brutality against people of color has not stopped. According to Mapping Police Violence, some 1,147 people were killed by the police in 2017, disproportionately people of color. In just 12 of these cases were officers charged with a crime. Yet even if the state chooses not to prosecute, civil litigation can help the victims and their families get redress from the state for their loss.#MeToo Sexual harassment and sexual assault are chronically underreported, and in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, exploded to the public consciousness through the #MeToo movement. From Ellen Pao’s explosive 2015 lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins to the brave women who brought down Bill O’Reilly and Roger Ailes, sexual harassment litigation gives women the power to fight back against abusers.Predatory For-Profit UniversitiesFor-profit universities (such as Ashford University, currently being sued by the California Attorney General) have been accused of targeting low-income students, minorities, and veterans, offering subpar educations with few job prospects, and saddling students with a lifetime of debt. The Obama administration released a list of of hundreds of college programs that load students with more debt than they can repay. Whistleblower lawsuits have brought several down. We’d like to see more.Private Prison LaborIncarcerated workers, often paid less than $1 an hour, have been involved with mining, agriculture, and even sewing garments for Victoria’s Secret. At least one class action was filed against Geo Group, one of the largest U.S. private prison companies, for allegedly violating federal anti-trafficking laws by coercing them to work for free under threat of solitary confinement. Private prisons make up at least a $5 billion industry in the United States, and generate a significant amount of profit from convict-leasing programs. Labor litigation would help make sure those prisoners are paid.Cryptocurrency ScamsAs Bitcoin prices continue to skyrocket, the number of affiliated cryptocurrency scams similarly continues to grow, preying especially on unsophisticated investors lured by quick cash. While the SEC has cracked down on a few obvious scams, still other cryptocurrency frauds have yet to be exposed for defrauding investors. As the bubble continues to grow, along with stories of regular people taking out second mortgages and home equity lines to buy into ICO’s, effective securities litigation will protect investors and clamp down on fraud.Data Privacy In the wake of the Equifax hack and the Uber leak, the flagrant disregard by big corporations for consumer data privacy has culminated in significant data privacy litigation. Not only has Equifax been hit with several class actions, but many consumers also chose to bring claims in small claims court. Litigation forces companies like Equifax to prioritize data privacy and elevates data security to a business-critical issue. Let’s make sure other companies that have access to our information and credit card numbers learn the same lesson.Eva Shang is a member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 class of 2018 and a cofounder of Legalist.

The dino-monster-hunting game is the first time a game in the series has released simultaneously across the globe. Prior to this, the franchise was largely a Japanese phenomenon with limited traction in the West.The reviews so far have been positively glowing, which may lead many gamers to make a purchase without quite realizing just what the Monster Hunter series is all about. As Dave Thier points out, many of these reviews have been written by long-time fans of the series and reflect a perfectly reasonable bias toward gamers who have played multiple installments and seen the series grow and evolve.But what about new players? For some, I imagine they'll quickly find themselves addicted to the game's rhythms and beats. Going on increasingly challenging hunts with friends by your side can be both thrilling and addictive. Others may find the game much more underwhelming and tedious.I've played one other Monster Hunter game before---Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii---and while I find World to be better in just about every way possible, I still can't get into the game. I have my reasons, and none of them are because I think the game is ""bad"" necessarily. It's just not my cup of tea. It might not be yours, either. Here's why.1. It's very grindy/crafty.Some people love to grind. It's why Destiny is so popular. It's why MMOs are so popular. A lot of games are all about grinding your way to higher levels and better loot. Such is the case with Monster Hunter: World. You go forth and hunt down dinosaurs and dragons and other beasts, kill them, harvest their parts (and gather other resources) then bring them back to the base and craft them into upgrades or better gear. Rinse and repeat. If this sounds tedious to you, you might want to try out a more straightforward monster-hunting game like Shadow of the Colossus, which is a much more minimalist experience. This isn't a game about going out and finding better loot, it's a game about going out and finding better stuff to craft better gear with. As Paul Tassi notes, that can feel a bit laborious.2. The combat is too clunky/floaty.I've seen people erroneously compare this game to Dark Souls. That's wrong for two reasons. First, Monster Hunter games predate Dark Souls. If anything, From Software borrowed from Monster Hunter when the studio developed Demon's Souls and the later Souls games. Second, because Dark Souls combat didn't just borrow from Monster Hunter, it vastly improved upon the series' combat. Compared to the Souls games, Monster Hunter: World has floaty, clunky, irritatingly imprecise combat. That's only made tolerable by the fact that your enemies are usually so gigantic it doesn't matter how poor hit detection is. There are some cool weapons and some cool moves (I dig the Insect Glaive and its vault jump quite a bit) but overall I just don't really care for combat in this game. It's fine, I suppose, but it ought to be much, much better. Give me Dragon's Dogma any day of the week over this.Monster Hunter: World is best played with friends.3. It's heavily weighted toward co-op play.A growing trend in video games is to have everything geared toward some form of multiplayer. In Monster Hunter: World, like in Rare's upcoming Sea of Thieves, cooperative play is the name of the game. (I don't think Sea of Thieves is for solo players at all.) Sometimes this is great, and for some gamers co-op play is the best kind of play. But other times I feel like this can drag down the story. Halo 5 is a good example of co-op being forced down gamers' throats to the detriment of the game. Like Halo 5, Monster Hunter: World's co-op is online only. That's a shame because I really love co-op if it's split-screen local co-op. Also, the online matchmaking is kind of terrible in the game and that's not even counting the problems it's been having on Xbox One. Sure, you can still play Monster Hunter: World by yourself, but that's not really how it was designed.4. It's not much for story.Okay, there's a story in Monster Hunter: World. There's a bunch of lore to uncover. But this is not the point of the game. If you enjoy story-driven games or story-heavy RPGs, you may not be interested in this game. Again, that doesn't mean it's a bad game or that it doesn't have a worthwhile story to tell, it's just not anything to write home about either. Some really great games don't have much in the way of story (see Dark Souls above, for instance, which is one of my very favorite games) but if you're into games with a major focus on narrative, you might be better off steering clear of Monster Hunter: World.5. There's not much gameplay beyond this.I like games that introduce clever puzzles, interesting platforming, or incredible level design. Monster Hunter: World is basically a game about following your little green scoutflies to the next footprint or skid mark (heh) which basically constitutes tracking, and then fighting a monster before harvesting it for crafting materials. Then you go back to the base and upgrade stuff and stock up on items and go out again to fight another monster. There's a big open-world to explore, and it's quite lovely to look at, but there aren't really interesting levels. There aren't really any puzzles beyond figuring out your quarry, and there isn't much in the way of actual level design. Again, this isn't a criticism of the game itself. It does what it sets out to do quite well. It's just a reason that some gamers may find it kind of flat and boring.Monster Hunter: World is still a fun game, even if it's not my cup of tea.I do like many things about the game.I love the base city, Astera. It's a sprawling, ramshackle metropolis built out of the hulls of ships. It's quite possibly one of the coolest non-combat hubs I've seen in a game. I also really love how dino fights can have unexpected twists. A monster might get tangled up in vines or you might find a new monster suddenly attacking the one you were just fighting. This can make fights feel very dynamic, which is cool. I also enjoy climbing on top of a monster and riding it while attacking, or enlisting other monsters in the hunt.Meanwhile, there's no denying the game looks and sounds beautiful. Perhaps more than anything, it's a great way to blow off steam. Yes, the systems are complicated, but it's still much more accessible than previous games and it's easy to hop in and play for half an hour and then hop back out. Sometimes it's tricky to fairly critique a game that just isn't your cup of tea. But I can definitely see why people love this game, even if it's not for me. And hey, even if you think it might not be for you, I've heard from plenty of people that they tried it and ended up loving it. So who knows?Monster Hunter: World is a very good game that deserves the praise it's gotten. It's just not for everybody, and it's important to realize that before jumping in based on review scores and word of mouth alone. If you enjoy the game, fine. If it's not for you, that's fine too. There's more than enough games coming out in 2018. There will undoubtedly be something for everyone.Further Reading:"

currency Bitcoin – has uses beyond making early adopters in virtual ...","Jan 15, 2018,12:28am EST","Technology is bringing about seismic changes to just about every aspect of our modern lives. In 2018 we will see self-driving cars, artificially intelligent doctors and deliveries carried out by drones.","Contrary to what many seem to think, you don’t need to be a software engineer or computer scientist to be a leader in the digital revolution. More vital is the ability to match technological solutions with existing business problems in innovative ways.Adobe StockHowever, this does mean that an understanding of the underlying forces and mechanics driving these trends is critical. So here is my overview of 5 trends which I think should be firmly on the radar of anyone setting out to make digital waves this year.We are creating an unprecedented amount of data as we live our lives. From social media to the digital footprint we leave as we use services like Netflix or Fitbit or connected systems at work. Every second, 900,000 people hit Facebook, 452,000 of us post to Twitter, and 3.5 million of us search for something on Google.This is happening so rapidly that the amount of data which exists is doubling every two years, and this growth (and the opportunities it provides) is what we call Big Data.The sheer value of this data means an industry as well as an enthusiastic, non-commercially driven community has grown around Big Data. Whereas just a few years ago only giant corporations would have the resources and expertise to make use of data at this scale, a movement towards “as-a-service” platforms has reduced the need for big spending on infrastructure. This explosion in data is what has made many of today’s other trends possible, and learning to tap into the insights will increase anyone’s prospects in just about any field.In what now seems like the “olden days”, only computers could connect to the internet. Maybe, if they were very advanced, some phones could to. Today you can buy lightbulbs, refrigerators, cars, watches, kettles, thermostats and many other “smart”, and therefore connected, objects. In industry, machines are increasingly being built to communicate with each other with less need for human input, in order to more efficiently carry out tasks. Collectively this trend is known as “Internet of Things”, because it isn’t just an internet of computers and phones any more!Intel forecasts that by 2020 there will be 200 billion devices connected to the internet. Data from these devices can help us to make better decisions about our lives (such as monitoring our exercise habits with Fitbit) as well as in business. There are huge opportunities out there for those who are able to develop products and services based around this data, and potential here is really only limited by imagination.Not literally as in take over the world (yet). But they will certainly have our attention. The field of cognitive computing revolves around machines which are capable of “thinking” in a similar way humans do – particularly when it comes to learning. Of course, being computers they have certain advantages – in other words, teach them to learn, and they will do so at an incredibly fast rate, with a greater degree of accuracy than any human would be capable of. The result is that they will inevitably become more knowledgeable, capable and able to match solutions (data) to problems.Today’s artificial intelligence systems are either specialized (designed for one task) or generalized (designed to adapt to any task) – though true generalized AI is still a distant goal. They use methods such as computer vision to enable machines to “see” – recognizing objects visually and classifying them accordingly, or natural language processing to communicate with us in a human-like way.As with Big Data (and remember it’s the amount of data they have access to which is bringing machines close to what we think of as “intelligent”), AI can seem a daunting prospect. Have no fear, though – again, thanks to the explosion of open source and “as-a-service” options, today it is a viable prospect for organizations of all sizes. Skills and expertise in this area are sure to be in high demand in 2018.The way we interact with machines has evolved from operating levers and valves, to control panels, keyboards and touchscreen interfaces. Thanks (again) to the amount of data we have, we are now at a point where voice controlling machines feels natural and is often the most intuitive option we have.It’s been predicted that by 2020 half of online searches will be carried out by voice – and 30% of them will be made using devices which have no screen at all. This year, BMW will roll out new cars with Alexa pre-installed, just as Ford has done.In business we will become increasingly used to using AI assistants to manage day-to-day schedules and put information in front of us when we need it. Going beyond that, there are opportunities to drive sales well as move to a more data-driven customer experience model, through the use of chatbots and natural language-capable marketing tools.Blockchain – the distributed, encrypted and public ledger behind virtual currency Bitcoin – has uses beyond making early adopters in virtual currencies filthy stinking rich. Experts say that it represents a leap forward in information storage and security.A blockchain is really just a digital file in which blocks of information are linked together (“chained”) and secured using private key cryptography, ensuring only those with appropriate permission can edit the sections of the data they are entitled to.Because copies of the file are stored on multiple computer systems (distributed) and kept synchronized through the consensus of the network, they potentially enable innovative solutions to problems involving tracking and ledgering transactions in a digital world.In fact blockchain has the potential to change the very foundations of our economic system, though this is likely to be some way off. In the meantime, anyone capable of fitting blockchain technology to current business problems is likely to find their skills in demand.2018 will be an exciting year for technological innovations that will leverage big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning AI, speech and natural language interfaces, and blockchains tools to transform and improve the world we live in."

New research identifying the hottest emerging industries for start-up entrepreneurs claims to answer that question, identifying areas ranging from crypto-currency to cannabis as the go-to sectors for those with a new business idea.The study, published by the online graphic design marketplace 99designs is based on analysis of projects launched on the platform at the end of 2017 – and how the nature of those projects has changed compared to two years ago and four years ago.Pamela Webber, 99designs’ chief marketing officer, says the analysis suggests a common theme that many entrepreneurs are choosing to target in different ways. “Escapism seems to be a central theme running through the types of businesses that have skyrocketed on our platform in the past two years,” Webber says. “In what many have seen as a tough year for natural disasters, tragedies and political strife, maybe it isn’t a surprise that businesses offering consumers a break from daily life, or even a financial plan B, seem to be thriving.”The four most popular new industries on 99designs going into 2018, based on increases in the number of projects launched, are:Cryptocurrency businessesWith bitcoin continuing to make headlines, the whole cryptocurrency industry has seen its profile soar in recent months. Projects incorporating the term “cryptocurrency” have recorded a 458 per cent increase since 2015 – and an 821 per cent increase over the last four years.Globally, New York and San Francisco are the top two cities for cryptocurrency start-ups, while London is third most popular city with entrepreneurs in this area. Within Europe, Berlin and Paris are second and third respectively behind London in terms of the number of cryptocurrency start-ups.Cannabis businessesWhether for recreational or strictly medical use, marijuana is now legal in more than half of all US states, and a supporting industry has developed more or less overnight. Projects with the terms “cannabis” or “marijuana” in the title have increased 55 per cent in the past two years.US cities dominate the global table with Los Angeles, Portland and Denver the three most popular venues for cannabis start-ups. Two Canadian cities – Vancouver and Toronto – also made it into the top 10.Virtual reality start-upsIn 2018, virtual reality becomes ever more mainstream, with many new players entering the game. Projects with the terms “augmented reality” or “virtual reality” are up 38 per cent compared to 2015 (and up by 514 per cent since 2013).Globally, San Francisco, Los Angeles and London are the most popular cities for VR start-ups. Within Europe, Zurich and Berlin are second and third to London.Alternative travel businessesTravellers want new experiences, from boutique hotels to ‘voluntourism’ and from recreational vehicles to Airbnb. 99designs found projects with the terms “boutique hotel,” “airbnb,” “van rental” and “camper van” have increased by 27 per cent in the past two years and are up by 211 per cent since 2013.Globally San Francisco, Austin and London are the most popular cities for alternative travel start-ups. Within Europe, London again tops the list, followed by Berlin and Paris while Bristol is the fifth most popular European city in this category. "

currencies shoppers trade in today. Freestanding kiosks that offer ...","Jan 16, 2018,10:46am EST","The shopper came to the store to pick up an awaiting jacket. She left having been offered free tailoring and a glass of wine, with a sense of being swept off her feet — all within steps of the shop door.","PixabayThis will be the retail experience of 2018. Pressured by data-enhanced online competition, nimble startups and super-powered shoppers, retailers are testing their creative abilities to recapture the shopper’s imagination. And this will manifest in many great opportunities for shoppers in the coming months.In short, it will be a buyer’s market for shoppers. As many as 12,000 stores are predicted to shutter in 2018, according to estimates by commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. That follows roughly 9,000 store closings in 2017, when more than 50 retail chains filed for bankruptcy protection, reports Business Insider.Retailers are responding by inventing new ways to romance shoppers, and that means identifying what they want most. All of which leads to big opportunities for consumers. Here are five that shoppers can expect in 2018.1: More free services. Free samples are rarely rejected, but now they are sooo 2015. Today’s shopper can expect free cosmetic treatments, in-home tech consultations and classes. And they can even anticipate these perks without buying something. The Apple Town Square store in Las Vegas (and other locations) offers free classes in music, photography and technology basics (all using Apple devices). Sephora offers free mini makeovers; Best Buy sends in-home advisors to help customers with smart homes, appliances and more; and Walmart plans to expand free curbside pickup to 1,000 locations in 2018, for a total of 2,100 stores.2: More relevant offers and suggestions. Retail’s broad adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning is enabling brands to access massive amounts of data to more accurately assess shopper preferences and make on-the-money suggestions. For shoppers, this means successful (and shorter) shopping trips. Alibaba uses deep learning to enable what it calls FashionAI: In-store interactive screens that make clothing and accessory suggestions to shoppers based on what they are trying on. Shoppers can then make their choices on screen. The screen does not use a camera; it reads information on product tags and relies on a memory of millions of clothing items, by store.3: More for less (time). Forget bitcoin; retailers realize that time is among the most valuable of currencies shoppers trade in today. Freestanding kiosks that offer endless aisles of products, new store layouts to accommodate quick trips, and grab-and-go meals at the door will be commonplace as retailers retrofit their formats. Target’s next-generation store in Richmond, Texas, includes two entrances, one expressly for online pickups or grab-and-go food items. In Spain, the fast-fashion chain Zara is following Walmart’s lead and testing self-service kiosks where shoppers can retrieve orders they placed online.4: More bargaining. Many shoppers expect to dicker over the price of a mattress or car, but they can apply those same skills, with success, at specialty and department stores. Many electronics chains, for example, are willing to haggle on price, according to Consumer Reports. Beyond the price tag, shoppers of Jet.com can get lower prices on items if they order more than one of each. Or shoppers can squeeze out as much product as they can for one price. MoviePass and Smashburger are among brands offering unlimited or nearly unlimited products and services for a flat fee. In many cases the shopper only needs to use the pass a few times a week to break ahead.5: Less aggravation. Retailers are acknowledging shopper pain points for what they are: Barriers to purchase, not necessary evils. Casper Mattress answers the generations-long plea to just get the mattress into the bedroom without a rope, car roof and sore back. Returns are another major area where shoppers can expect relief. With Walmart’s return app, Mobile Express Returns, shoppers simply enter the merchandise info and then make a brisk return through a dedicated express lane. For those unhappy with online purchases, the retail service Happy Returns operates a network of return bars that accept items purchased from a variety of participating brands. The service, in nearly 15 metro areas, is free and does not require receipts.Retailers may have lots of price power, brand contracts and shopper data, but they recognized a long time ago the shopper has control, and is gaining more. Technology liberates shoppers to purchase their shoes, meals and makeup based on what is at their fingertips at the precise moment they need these things, so why settle for less? Retailers know the only way to stand out is to be amazing.Happy 2018. Prepare to be amazed."

[+] signing ceremony for the enrollment for the conference report to H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. that was passed this week by the House and Senate, at the U.S. Capitol on December 21, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)","The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has turned us into a nation of tax shelter hunters. The bill, which backers like to promote as tax reform, has in fact set off a frenzy of loophole-seeking. These are all symptoms, not of tax reform, but of what my Tax Policy Center colleague Gene Steuerle likes to call tax deform.Seemingly everyone is looking for ways to game the new tax system. Can I benefit from the new 20 percent deduction on pass-through business income by transforming myself from a wage-earner to a sole proprietor?  Should I open a donor-advised fund so I can bunch my charitable contributions in one year and take the standard deduction in the next? How about making contributions on behalf of kindergartners to tax-free Sec.  529 education savings plans? Or hedging against often-changing tax rates by contributing to both a traditional and a Roth 401(k)?Preserving SALTEven state and local governments are getting in the act. After Congress limited the federal tax deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), California lawmakers looked to turn their state taxes into charitable gifts, so some residents can fully deduct their payments. Across the county, New York officials want to replace partially-deductible individual income taxes with employer-paid payroll taxes that are fully deductible to firms.Then there was the mad property tax scramble at the end of 2017. People stood in the freezing cold. To pay their 2018 property taxes. Early. All in the hope that it might reduce their 2017 tax bill.According to published reports, some banks were advising customers to  take out home equity loans to pre-pay their taxes. And I won’t be surprised to learn that many who did prepay will get no benefit, either because they are on the Alternative Minimum Tax (that largely eliminates the benefit of the SALT deduction) or because they will be taking the standard deduction for the 2017 tax year.Copying companiesIn some sense, middle-income taxpayers are emulating big multinational corporations—through they are doing so without the proper tax planning advice. For years, multinationals have had teams of lawyers and other experts helping them minimize their taxes, in some cases bringing their worldwide tax bills to zero, or even below. For them, the TCJA creates new tax minimization opportunities.Ordinary households may be only vaguely aware of the new law’s corporate tax changes, but they seem to have embraced the hunt for their own tax reduction strategies with gusto.My Tax Policy Center colleague Steve Rosenthal, a long-time tax lawyer, says he awaiting the next step: Mass market promotors who promise to make you a pass-through business for $500. No doubt, many of the hustlers will get rich even as their customers end up deeply disappointed.An accountant friend now has a stock answer to clients who ask, “what should I do” in the wake of the TCJA. His reply: “Become an accountant. There is plenty of business for all of us.”There is a strange echo to this frenzy, at least for those of us who remember the big 1981 tax cut. It too set off a wave of tax sheltering, though mostly for upmarket investors. By 1986, even members of the Senate Finance Committee—a group not known for its concern about unfettered tax breaks—were outraged. Many would wave shelter advertisements from The Wall Street Journal and Barron’s while decrying tax scams. I remember one ad that promoted the income tax benefits of investing in bull semen.We may be headed the same way now: A mad scramble for tax shelters followed by public outrage and eventual retrenchment.It is a little like the bitcoin frenzy. When grandmothers are bragging about their triple-digit returns in cryptocurrencies, something is very wrong. And when middle-income households are scrambling to minimize the tax liability by doing things they half-understand, something else is very wrong. "

Dot-Com Bubble.” But I digress. Today In: Investing ...","Jan 30, 2018,12:17pm EST",,"In October of 1998, the global stock market suffered a sharp drop due to geopolitical issues involving Asia and Russia.  The drop was over quickly however, and what followed was a remarkable 17-month run that took the S&P 500 from about 950 to a then all-time high of about 1525 in March of 2000.  That would be the S&P’s peak until July 2007, over seven years later.  This was part of a so-called “Lost Decade” in stock market investing, in which the S&P 500 produced about a zero return for a period of more than 10 years.  This was not the only such period in stock market history, but it is the most recent one.  You would think that investors would remember it and respect it, but I see increasing evidence that this is not the case.  I will cover that more in upcoming articles.Here is the chart of that 1998-2000 period I discussed to start this discussion.  A bull market that started in 1994 was briefly threatened in October of 1998, and its recovery spurred one of the sharpest up-moves in market history.  The S&P 500 advanced more than 50% in 17 months.Not shown here is that the Nasdaq Composite Index had a heavy influence on the S&P’s move.  The Nasdaq was bursting with dot-com era businesses, some of which would become market leaders, but most would vanish like the Wicked Witch of the West.  During that October 1998 through March 2000 period of merely 17 months, climbed from 1,500 to 5,000!  Incredibly, a year later, it was back under 1,700.  Frankly in the era of Bitcoin, I feel old-fashioned talking about “Ye Ol’ Dot-Com Bubble.”  But I digress.So, here we are again.  What do I mean by that?  Look at this chart below.Here is what I see: a market that recovered from a near-bear market in late 2015 and early 2016 (unless you forgot, the S&P fell about 12% in 6 weeks), and that near-miss sparked a price surge that took the index up from around 1,900 to where it is now, knocking on the door of 2,800.  That’s a more than a 45% move in under 2 years.  And again, the Nasdaq is a leading contributor.  And again, investors are getting excited, with FOMO (fear of missing out) becoming a dominant driver of market movement.As a market technician, I am mildly interested in the real-world rationalizations, guesses, and excuses for what causes mature bull markets to vault higher as a final act of defiance to all that care about concepts like valuation, consumer and government debt and other “silly stuff” like that.  I care about gauging reward and risk potential at any point in time, and then investing in a way that addresses that tradeoff.  So, the thing I found particularly interesting about these two time periods is that if you allow for a little bit of mathematical rounding, the current period of S&P 500 prices is about twice that of the 1998-2000 period that in many ways reminds me of what is happening now.Specifically, the 1,900 starting point of early 2016 is about twice that of the 950 starting point of October 1998.  If past is prologue (as it often is in investing), we can make a case that the 1,525 high of the year 2000 should allow for the real possibility that the current move has additional strength to 3,050, give or take.  That’s about 10% above the level as of this writing (January 15, 2018).  I am not trying to call a top here, but merely pointing out that the historical parallels are striking.  This is something to consider both for those who see the current market environment of the “end of the beginning” of a great bull market that will last for years (many Wall Street strategists are in that camp) and the “beginning of the end” for folks like me who acknowledge that this is a period of remarkable strength, but also recognize that in market cycles, it is always hottest before winter.Much of Wall Street still clings to the idea that long-term success is about “hanging in there” and “owning the market” which has convinced millions of investors to flood hard-earned cash into equity index funds and funds that are essentially indexes in “active management” clothing.  A long time ago, I decided not to be one of those investors.  Instead, I devote my investment work to succeeding over longer time periods that include bull and bear market cycles.  At times, this can make people like me unpopular, since we get labeled as “perma-bears,” out of touch with “the new normal” and things like that, when all we are really doing is alerting investors to the importance of having an investment discipline that you can come back to in good times and bad.  After all, investing is not a game, but a lifestyle funding tool.The financial services business and financial media has taken a different path.  They sell the sizzle of recent past performance, and focus on relatively meaningless time periods such as calendar years and quarters.  They often take good, basic investment concepts and innovations out of the investment laboratory to the public, and eventually blunt their potential positive impact by over-selling them to an investment population that often cannot possibly decipher where the applicable features end and where the BS begins.  It works for a while (for Wall Street and the consumer) but then it doesn’t, and fortunes are lost.  We have seen it twice this century, and I expect we will see it again.  But the market’s move higher and the associated acceleration in public greed has been something remarkable to watch. And will continue to be, until it is not.  And then, articles like this one will be re-published, as a reminder that, as the old saying goes, those who are ignorant of history are doomed to repeat it."

@jeffkauflin. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin and ether. Read Less.","Editors' Pick|Jan 23, 2018,09:45am EST","Northern Trust was named the best employer for diversity. Above, a group of employees, including... [+] head of Corporate Social Responsibility Connie Lindsey and Chairman Rick Waddell, participate in a community service project.","One study after another has shown that companies with more diverse teams have stronger financial performance. But without being an employee, it’s often difficult to get visibility into how seriously a company takes diversity. Forbes worked with research firm Statista to compile the definitive list of the best employers for diversity in America. Statista surveyed 30,000 U.S. employees in August 2017 to inform the list, asking questions about diversity, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age and disability. Responses among underrepresented ethnic minorities, women and people aged 50 and older received greater weight in the ranking.  Other factors Statista incorporated were the gender split of companies’ management teams and boards, and whether a company proactively communicates about diversity. It also looked at the gap in diversity perceptions at a given organization. For example, if women, older employees and underrepresented minorities rated an employer poorly on diversity, but everyone else rated it highly, Statista considered that a negative indicator and adjusted the score downward. Only companies with 1,000 or more workers were eligible to qualify for the list.To see the top 10 employers for diversity, open the slideshow below. For the full list of 250, click here. Northern Trust, an investment management firm with 17,800 employees, takes the top spot. The 128-year-old, Chicago-based company continuously delivers “widespread Diversity at Work training,” according to its website. Among Northern Trust’s top executives, women make up 38%, a level significantly higher than the 27% observed among S&P 500 companies. African-Americans make up 23% of the board. “We seek an inclusive environment where our unique mix of attributes and diversity of perspectives can serve as catalysts for innovation,” says Northern Trust CEO Michael O’Grady.The Smithsonian Institution takes second place. It manages 19 museums—mostly based in Washington, D.C.—making it “the world’s largest museum, education, and research complex,” its website says. In September 2016, it opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Demand has been sky-high, making tickets hard to come by. Levy is the third-best employer for diversity on Forbes’ list. The company has stand-alone restaurants in cities like Chicago and St. Paul, and it designs and manages concession stands in arenas and stadiums across the country. In baseball parks alone, it sells food at 41 venues, according to its website. Female executives make up half of its eight-person executive team. Levy’s parent company, Compass Group, released a diversity and inclusion report for 2016 that gave an unusual level of transparency into its workforce demographics. It showed that 43% of management-level employees at Compass Group were women, 15% were African-American, and 10% were Hispanic. Other companies that made the top 10 included Intuit, the Silicon Valley software firm that makes TurboTax. Emory University in Atlanta, led by president Claire Sterk, ranks seventh. And the ever-popular grocery store Wegmans comes in eighth place.

work, ...","Jan 8, 2018,08:50am EST","Federal tax reform passed at year-end, but not everyone is happy. There could be lawsuits and work-arounds by states trying to blunt the impact of some of the provisions. One of the most distressing changes to taxpayers in high tax states is the cap on state income and property tax deductions. In California, we are used to writing off high California taxes. When you pay 13.3%, a write-off with the IRS helps. A $10,000 limit doesn’t go very far in the Golden State, but you have to hand it to California for creativity. If passed, the pending Protect California Taxpayers Act will take a creative spin on tax deductions. The federal tax law caps deductions at $10,000, so how about making them “charitable contributions?” ","ShutterstockThe pending bill tries that work-around, although whether the IRS would buy it is not yet clear. After all, wouldn’t you expect the IRS and FTB to attack taxpayers that try an end run like this? You might think so, but perhaps it will be different if state law provides a call-it-something-else workaround. It’s a curious turn of events, with California sounding a little like a tax-dodger. Some Californians are not waiting around for the state legislature. Some are moving out of the state, or at least thinking about it, even if New Yorker Millionaires love NYC too much to leave if taxes go up.For Californians, this is not a new phenomenon. For decades, tax lawyers in the golden state meet clients with wanderlust, often right before a big income event. Wandering taxpayers might be about to sell or take a company public or settle a big lawsuit. They might be about to sell highly appreciated Bitcoin. Whatever the circumstance, state taxes can play a big part. Moving doesn’t always work, if it isn’t done soon enough or done properly. And moving won’t help if you are selling something that is inherently always taxed by California, such as a sale of California real estate.But for many, a move done carefully, and with the right kind of income, can cut the sting of California's high 13.3% state tax. Apart from physical moves, another approach—that will probably be considered by more people in 2018—involves setting up a new type of trust in Nevada or Delaware. A ‘NING’ is a Nevada Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trust. A ‘DING’ is its Delaware sibling. There is even a ‘WING,’ from Wyoming. Let's say you can’t move, so you wonder if a trust in another state might sidestep California taxes.Living trusts are great for avoiding probate on death, but they don’t help for income tax purposes. You are still taxed on income from trust assets on your individual income tax return. With a Nevada or Delaware Incomplete Gift Non-Grantor Trust, the donor makes an incomplete gift—with strings attached—to the trust. The trustee must not be a resident of California. NING and DING trusts started with wealthy New Yorkers trying to sidestep New York taxes on certain assets. But New York changed the law to make the grantor taxable no matter what. California has not done that, but California’s Franchise Tax Board says it is studying the issue. It is possible that California tax authorities will pursue these trusts in audits and tax controversies.But some people are giving it the old college try. Some marketers of NING and DING trusts offer them as alternatives or adjuncts to a physical move. The idea is for income and gain in the NING or DING trust not to be taxed by California until it is distributed. At that point, the distributees will hopefully no longer be residing in California. California taxes all income at up to 13.3%, and there is no lower rate for long term capital gain. Tax-deferred compounding can yield impressive results, even if only state income tax is being sidestepped.Parents frequently fund irrevocable trusts for children, and may not want the trust to make distributions for many years. The parents might also remove future appreciation of trust assets from their estates. Since most trusts are taxable where the trustee is situated, one common answer is an institutional trust company in Delaware or South Dakota, where there is no state income tax. For trust investment and distribution committees, committee members should also not be residents of California. Outside of New York, the jury is still out on NING and DING trusts. The facts, documents, and details matter. But if one is careful, willing to bear some risk, and there is sufficient money at stake, the calculated risks may make sense."

swelling, there is one blockchain-based service that is actually being ...","Jan 30, 2018,09:00am EST","While regulation was the overarching theme in financial services (FS) over the last few years, there are now other topics taking center stage. I've focused here on an overview of five areas that every FS professional should know something about to succeed in the new year. I will explore these in more detail in subsequent articles, but first, here is 20,000-foot executive summary of what matters most:","Shutterstock1. Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL): A new accounting method for potential loan lossesThe What: Banks have always needed to hold reserves against potential credit losses. Today, those reserves are based on estimates of incurred losses. With CECL, in addition to incurred losses, reserves will also need to be taken based on expected but not yet incurred losses over the life of the loan. Financial Institutions will need to revise their loan loss procedures as well as their projected loss models to account for the changes required by CECL.The So-What: A substantial change requiring a large effort to implement and impacting earnings:• Change Management Challenge: Large change program is required to define new allowance process and governance, data, determine modeling approach and tools, etc.• Capital Hit: Since potential losses are being recognized earlier, the amount of reserves will increase which will require additional capital and serve to lower the retained earnings component of equity2. LIBOR Replacement: A new benchmark being defined for short-term interest ratesThe What: LIBOR, the published rate that has served as a benchmark for short-term interest rates since the 1980s, will be going away. Recent scandals involving the manipulation of LIBOR as well as the lack of sufficient, observable data to set the rate has led the organizations that oversee LIBOR to look for an alternative.In the U.S., the Fed has tasked the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC) to be responsible for the transition. The ARRC has proposed a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate (BTFR) as the USD LIBOR replacement.The So-What: Be aware of current and future LIBOR based obligations at your institution.While the actual change is still a few years away, preparation for the new benchmark will be massive. Loans and floating rate bonds tied to LIBOR will have to be addressed contractually, and deal-specific covenants may require consents from the owners of these securities. International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master agreements will also have to be amended or replaced.3. Data Curation: Get a museum pass to visit your dataThe What: Valuable assets in a museum have a curator responsible for cataloging, describing and managing the piece so others will find it useful. FS organizations have realized that data is actually their most valuable asset and also needs to be cataloged, described and managed. Since we can’t put the data behind a glass with a plaque, we must use software tools instead. Software packages such as Alation and Collibra allow for a business user-friendly way to catalog and manage an organization’s data such that the right data can be sourced with high confidence and in a consistent manner throughout the organization.The So-What: Get on board your organization’s data program as a data steward, data curator, etc. This is not for techies anymore. First-line business users will own the data they create and being the one who has the key will be a good spot to be in.4. Blockchain: Feel the Ripple effectThe What: Contrary to the hype, blockchain will not solve world hunger. While the bubble around Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies are still swelling, there is one blockchain-based service that is actually being used successfully in the FS arena and is not modeled as a disintermediation effort. Enter Ripple -- which is being used by major financial institutions as settlement infrastructure technology -- particularly in the areas of payments and foreign exchange.The So-What: For FS professionals, it would make sense to study Ripple as a model of how banks may work together with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies and try to develop similar use cases to benefit from blockchain’s momentum.5. Know Your Customer (KYC) and Robotics: Free the human from the yoke of robotic tasksThe What: If there is one use case screaming for Robotics Process Automation (RPA), it is the KYC process. There are robotic tasks in customer onboarding that we need to rescue humans from doing. (“Type company name into Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) check site. Save results as PDF. Store on share drive. Repeat ad infinitum.”) RPA tools can easily pre-populate KYC fields (like address and date of incorporation) by reading them from documents or websites and OFAC checks can be readily automated using the most basic of RPA functions.The So-What: If your organization still performs KYC manually, then clamor loudly and firmly for introducing RPA. It is a low-risk and high-reward endeavor, and the humans performing these tasks will thank you for exorcising the robot within them.Now, you’ve learned enough to impress your colleagues or your boss. In subsequent articles, I will dive a bit deeper and show how you can be the hero who delivers on these areas for your institution in 2018."

In 2017, I wrote about how The Employee Experience is the Future of Work. Now, as we enter 2018, the next journey for HR leaders will be to leverage artificial intelligence combined with human intelligence and create a more personalized employee experience.","Artificial Intelligence Is Transforming The Workplace As we increase our personal usage of chatbots (defined as software which provides an automated, yet personalized, conversation between itself and human users), employees will soon interact with them in the workplace as well. Forward looking HR leaders are piloting chatbots now to transform HR, and, in the process, re-imagine, re-invent, and re-tool the employee experience.How does all of this impact HR in your organization? The following ten HR trends will matter most as AI enters the workplace:1. Expect Humans To Work Along Side Artificial IntelligenceMy Forbes column, The Intersection of AI and HR  profiled three chatbots: Talla, Jane, and Jill Watson, and examined how artificial intelligence is working side by side with HR managers and teaching assistants. This was reinforced by a new Gartner report, predicting that  one in five workers will have AI as their co worker in 2022. At Georgia Institute of Technology, this is business as usual. Last year, Jill Watson, powered by IBM Watson analytics, became the ninth teaching assistant for an online course taught by Professor Ashok Goel entitled Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence. Professor Goel estimates that within a year, Jill Watson was able to answer 40% of all the students’ questions, freeing the human TAs to tackle more complex technical inquiries, such as, ""How do you define intelligence?"" In fact, one student reported, ""Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA, always there reminding us of due dates and posting questions to engage us mid-week, I find out she is a chatbot. I was flabbergasted.""This is just the beginning as AI becomes a new member of the team. And visionary HR leaders will increasingly consider chatbots  another co-worker, helping to orient and train them, and assisting the rest of the team  in understanding how to work with them. The end result will be more time for employees to do what makes them uniquely human such as;  complex problem solving, critical thinking, and creativity, the top three skills deemed essential By the World Economic Forum. 2. Identify Which Roles On Your Team Will Be Transformed By AI McKinsey research finds very few occupations will be automated in their entirety, rather certain activities will be re-defined requiring business processes and job roles to change. In fact, according the McKinsey Global Institute,  fewer than 5 percent of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. However, 60 percent of occupations could have 30 percent or more of their activities automated.We are already seeing this in some key roles like mortgage loan officers, where key activities are being automated so mortgage loan officers can spend more time advising clients and providing other higher levels of customer service. The same will hold for key roles in HR like Recruiter, Training Coordinator, and HR Service Center Advisor, among others, where AI will automate routine work activities and amplify work processes allowing individuals in these roles to provide greater value to their internal customers--employees.But the key will be for HR to develop an AI strategy and this starts by conducting research on what HR roles, processes, and workflows will be re-imagined with AI.Figure 1 presents one way to begin thinking about the implications of AI on work tasks, key job roles, and work processes. You can start this process by asking:Automate: What are the key activities within this role that could be automated to provide greater efficiency and effectiveness for accomplishing routine tasks?Augment: How could more value be created by applying data analytics to identify new business insights?Amplify: What work processes and workflows could be re-designed by machine learning? More job roles will change than will be become totally automated so HR needs to prepare today.3. Transform Talent Acquisition With Artificial IntelligenceThe most visible aspect of how HR is being impacted by artificial intelligence is the change in the way companies source and recruit new hires. Most notably, IBM has created a suite of tools that use machine learning to help candidates personalize their job search experience based on the engagement they have with Watson. In addition, Watson is helping recruiters prioritize jobs more efficiently, find talent faster, and match candidates more effectively. According to Amber Grewal, Vice President, Global Talent Acquisition, ""Recruiters are focusing more on identifying the most critical jobs in the business and on utilizing data to assist in talent sourcing.""With the benefit of Watson, companies can empower recruiters to concentrate more on filling placements based on critical ""core"" skills needed across the company, such as agile, cognitive, and cloud, rather than simply screening candidates on filters like “years of experience” or specific education levels. Grewal calls this, horizontal sourcing, and sees it as the end of the requisition based sourcing model. As organizations become flatter, there is a growing need to identify talent with core, horizontal skills that can easily move across various business verticals, domains, and industries. This is truly reinventing the recruiting function.4. Use Machine Learning to Help Employees Navigate Their Careers As employees stay in their roles longer, companies are leveraging machine learning to create internal career mobility platforms so employees can focus on career growth and not just promotions.CEB Global estimates that employees at all levels are staying in their roles up to 30% longer today. This slow down in upward mobility  is causing employers such as Cisco, GE and Panasonic to take a more active role in partnering with employees to prioritize growing career experiences over the rate of promotion.Elaine Mason, Vice President of People Planning Design and Analytics at Cisco, is leading an effort to create an internal career mobility platform so Cisco employees can ""choose their own adventure."" The platform, called My Development Space, uses machine learning so employees can build a profile showcasing their current skills, interests, and passions, and then view a range of internal roles that might be right for their next career opportunity. ""Our objective at Cisco is to create a career focused culture where employees are able to grow their capabilities through a series of lateral and vertical moves across silos and functions. The goal of My Development Space is to increase employee retention, grow employees' skills, and prepare them for both horizontal and upward positions.""5. Hack HR To Identify New HR Solutions A hackathon is an event where computer programmers, software designers, graphic artists, and others come together to create a new product. The Facebook “Like” button and Facebook Chat were both first demoed at internal Facebook hackathons.HR functions are now using the hackathon concept to identify new HR solutions. The Talent Experience team at Jet.com, a subsidiary of Walmart, used a hackathon to identify new ways to improve their candidate experience. The problem: the candidate experience took too long to match aspiring candidates with job openings. Research shows just how inefficient the process is: 85% of applicants don’t hear back after submitting an application— while 71% of employers claim that they can’t find a candidate with the right skill set.So Jet.com used a hackathon to improve the candidate experience by bringing HR leaders together with software designers and graphic designers to create new candidate process.The upshot: a new HR candidate solution process, dubbed Casy, uses machine learning to match job descriptions with key words in an applicant's resume, so the best candidate is identified in the shortest amount of time.6. Explore Using AI To Be A Virtual Coach And Reinforce LearningBy now, we are all familiar with chatbots as productivity tools, for tasks like booking a hotel room using the Expedia chatbot or ordering a Taco using TacoBot. But there are a number of newly funded companies that are investing in chatbots to provide individual coaching in the workplace and to reinforce learning following a traditional training program.MIT Media Lab startup GiantOtter is using artificial intelligence to develop and train “Coach Otto,” a bot that provides online coaching for companies. This is an interesting use case an employer can use a chatbot to participate in an extended conversation as a coach or companion amplifying a person’s ability to do their job. In the case of Coach Otto, this is preparing a manager to have a difficult conversation with a team member.Chatbots are also being used as a learning reinforcement following a traditional training program. This is the case with Freeman, a brand experience company. Freeman trains its sales staff on the basics of selling with a course called Selling Fundamentals. But Freeman needed a reinforcement strategy to help sales people apply sales skills on-the-job. Their solution: Coach TopGun SellFun, a chatbot designed to improve the retention of new skills from the Selling Fundamentals program. AI has the power to not only carry on conversations with employees but also reinforce key learning needed for job success.7. Use AI To Enhance Employee Communications Gartner predicts that by 2020, 85% of customer interactions will be managed by machines, without human input. The same may well be true for employee interactions. A recent ServiceNow survey of 350 HR leaders detailed in my Forbes column, The Intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human Resources, found more than two thirds of HR leaders believe employees are comfortable accessing chatbots to get the information they need, at the time they need it. In fact, I am starting to think of chatbots as your newest HR team member, one that allows employees to easily retrieve answers to frequently asked questions.The type of questions HR leaders believe employees are comfortable using a chatbot for range from the mundane and factual ones; such as how much paid time off do I have left, to the more personal ones; such as how do I report a sexual misconduct experience. And the prediction for 2020 by Deepak Bharadwaj, General Manager, HR Product Line, ServiceNow, is that the penetration of chatbots in the workplace could reach adoption rates of as high as 75% with employees accessing a chatbot to answer HR questions and access HR solutions anywhere and anytime. By using AI, HR leaders can create a seamless employee experience, one that mirrors their best customer experience.8. Examine How Leadership Will Be Changed As AI Moves Into ManagementAI is starting to take on tasks normally handled by mid-level managers. Chatbots can now:So what happens to mid-level managers in this process? Robert Thomas, of Accenture, believes leaders will routinely include AI on their leadership team and the impact will be enhanced decision making speed and the ability to look at alternative scenarios with multiple points of view. Thomas believes this can assist leaders to become more agile in the way software developers have become accustomed to. The end result is one where AI augments mid-level managers to deliver greater value to their team.9. Invest In The Human Experience Of WorkingWhile technology is certainly a key element of creating a best of breed employee experience, forward looking HR leaders understand the biggest critical component in successfully implementing AI in the workplace is to have leaders who are committed to inspire teams and examine how intelligent technologies will transform HR. This starts with creating a more human experience at work, one where employees get to know each other better.At Pandora, Kristen Robinson, CHRO, defines the employee experience journey as the ability to create an environment where employees perform, connect, and grow throughout their tenure with the company. While technology is part of the equation, Pandora is investing in creating more human connections between employees. And one of the ways they are doing this is a low tech solution: a podcast called People of Pandora, dedicated to sharing the stories of Pandora employees and their experiences both at Pandora and in their personal lives. You can listen for yourself to the podcast: People of Pandora.Leveraging podcasts to connect employees with each other is also happening at GE Crotonville where the popular podcast, Brilliance Leadership Learning (you can find this on iTunes) regularly includes interviews with GE executives such as GE Digital Leader, GE CHRO, GE Chief Communications Officer, all sharing their personal and professional stories.Look for a resurgence of and innovation in the power of storytelling in the digital age.10. Identify New Roles That Will Be Created By Artificial Intelligence Gartner estimates that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it eliminates by 2020.    This assumes 1.8 million jobs will be automated by 2020 but 2.3 million jobs will be created with a net gain of 500,000 new jobs created as artificial intelligence becomes widespread inside companies. The question is no longer when or if AI will transform the workplace, but how can  HR leaders prepare for a new world of work where AI augments the human workforce enabling some jobs to be more efficient and creating entirely new jobs along the way.The team at the Cognizant Center for the Future of Work addressed this issue and identified 21 new jobs that will emerge over the next 10 years and these new jobs may well be the cornerstone of new ways of working. These jobs were organized from low tech to high tech over the 10-year horizon from 2018 to 2028. Take a peek at how they all stack up in Figure 2.Two of my favorites include:The question for HR leaders is what are the new job roles in HR that are on the horizon as AI becomes integrated into the workplace? In interviews with clients, three interesting new roles have emerged:It is an interesting time we live in! That's why it’s more important than ever to prepare yourself, your team, and your organization to develop a strategy to leverage artificial intelligence across the employee life cycle, from recruitment to learning, career development, coaching, and on-going communication. As we enter 2018, HR leaders need to lead this effort in partnership with IT and Corporate Communications to take full advantage of how to leverage intelligent technologies to provide an enhanced employee experience.I look forward to hearing from you on how you are building your AI strategy.Jeanne C Meister is Partner, Future Workplace, and co-author of The Future Workplace Experience.

How are you addressing this need?Rhind: We’re trying to launch innovative, disruptive funds that fundamentally change the way people gain access to certain parts of the market. So that’s why we initially launched the business in the commodity sector.We are reinventing the way investors get exposure to commodities. We took the two most well-known benchmarks in the industry—the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which is a broad index of 20 individual commodities of the most well-known, highest traded commodities and the S&P GSCI Index, which is a similar index but with 21 different commodities—and we referenced them both inside ETFs that are the lowest cost in the industry.Our ETFs don’t issue K-1s, which is a form that partnerships typically distribute [to report share profits and losses from interests in limited partnerships] around tax time that can cause some headaches for investors that are not aware.Typically, individual investors and advisors prefer funds that don’t have K-1s. So we really try to do that. The reason we did it was because a lot of existing commodity funds had management fees that we felt were very high. And the structures were, in many cases, sub-optimal. For example, they were either notes issued by banks that carry credit risks of the issuing banks, or they were partnerships that distributed K-1s.Forbes: Well that sounds right on target for the present market.Rhind: Yes. No one had launched low-cost well-structured commodity funds, and that was the place we felt was the best fit to start the business. So, we launched the two broad commodity ETFs. GraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 (COMB) and GraniteShares S&P GSCI Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF (COMG) and we launched a gold ETF, GraniteShares Gold Trust (BAR), which is backed by physical gold and tracks the spot price of gold. The physical gold is stored in London. We felt it was a good time because commodity prices as measured by one of the broad indices stopped falling at the beginning of 2016—January 2016 was the low. And we’ve now had two back-to-back years of positive years for broad commodities.In 2018, I think the trends of higher global growth and inflation will continue to pick up. The dollar will continue to weaken, and this will be good for commodities more broadly and for gold. So, I think the timing is right for the business, for the product set that we’ve launched in the commodity space, and does a job that was needed in the market, which is providing low-cost access and removing the pain point of K1s.Most recently, we acquired a fund in the high-income space, GraniteShares HIPS U.S. High Income ETF (HIPS). Income is another area of the market we really like. It has a yield of 7.2%, and it’s diversified across multiple sectors of high income pass through securities. These are companies that are mandated by law to distribute substantially all of their income to shareholders. Some examples of high income pass through securities are REITs (real estate investment trusts), MLPs (master limited partnerships) and BDCs (business development companies).Forbes: That’s very different than commodities, then.Rhind: Different from underlying commodities yes, but MLPs typically are found in the commodity space. They’re usually partnerships that do things such as operate oil pipelines or other kinds of energy infrastructure, so they’re very much in the commodity space. We did look at offering an MLP ETF but decided against it because we couldn’t provide something that was, in our view, suitably differentiated from other MLP ETFs.The way we decided to do that was to differentiate by providing a more diverse exposure, not just MLPs but other high-income asset classes as well so that you could have a high yield or dividend that would be similar to what you have with MLPs, but without the sector-specific risk you get with MLPs of energy prices collapsing.Forbes: Are your funds sold directly by you to individual investors? Or do you sell primarily to managers? What’s your market?Rhind: They’re listed on the New York Stock Exchange. ETFs are really just like stocks; it’s not different from buying shares in Apple or any other listed company, provided you’ve got access to a brokerage account—be it an online broker such as a Schwab or a Fidelity—or a financial advisor. They’re bought and sold just like stocks.Typically, the biggest users of ETFs are financial advisors. That’s part of the Department of Labor fiduciary standard of putting clients first and using low-cost, tax efficient funds in order to provide fee-based asset allocation to underlying investors, which has been a huge trend within the industry. There’s a large group of financial advisors out there that use ETFs most exclusively because of that.Forbes: The market’s still performing well?Rhind: Commodities have been performing well over the last few years, as well as gold. I expect that to continue in 2018 because I think the inflationary trend that started around mid-2016 will continue. I think the dollar will continue to be weaker this year. A weaker dollar is good for gold and good for commodities. I think that employment in the U.S. will continue to increase, which will put pressure on wages, which is one cause of inflation.I also think that tax reform will be broadly positive for the commodity market, as manufacturing should increase. And again, it will encourage inflationary-type behaviors in the economy. We had a bear market in commodities in the five years leading up to 2016, and I think that the market is still supply constrained in many key commodities.Although prices have gone up broadly over the last two years, I think there is still room to grow as supply constraints within gold, for example, mean that supply cannot be increased dramatically and as in the case of some other asset classes that contribute to price fall. So I think the market is sort of well positioned for 2018. This year could well be the year that commodities actually outperform stocks, which we haven’t seen for a long time.Forbes: How large are your funds?Rhind: GraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 is approximately $13 million. GraniteShares Gold Trust is about $12 million. GraniteShares HIPS U.S. High Income is approximately $10 million and GraniteShares S&P GSCI Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF is approximately $4 million.Forbes: And they’re growing pretty rapidly I gather?Rhind: The business only really launched in the summer of last year. So the funds have only been going for six months, but it’s growing pretty rapidly.Forbes: Will, I can’t leave this without asking you about why GraniteShares has filed for a Bitcoin ETF, any thoughts you can share on that?Rhind: As it’s a matter of public record, I can confirm that we’ve filed for two Bitcoin ETFs. I’m afraid that as these funds are still subject to regulatory review, there is nothing more I can say on the topic at this time.Forbes: Well, thank you for taking the time to share your ideas. ETFs are a good topic to discuss as they’ve become so very popular.Rhind: Thank you so much, Wally, it’s been an absolute pleasure. "

summit at Games For Change. He owns Bitcoin, Ether, and other ...","Jan 26, 2018,01:01pm EST",Spark of Light,"A new bar for mobile VR.Much has been made of the storytelling capacities of immersive technologies—the chance to use interaction and 360° space to create novel experiences. Spark of Light, a game by Dutch studio Pillow's Willow VR Studios, is one example of how these new avenues produce storyworlds unlike anything we've seen in 2D media.In Spark of Light, players join Nerow, a little boy who lives in a fantasy realm full of magical creatures and playful steampunk aesthetics. When the sun is suddenly abducted, leaving the world in darkness, it's up to Nerow to restore it—and it's your job to work as his guide.Nerow journeying with a firefly.The game takes place in a miniature world that surrounds players. We're tasked with locating wild fireflies and sending them to Nerow, who uses his own magic to re-energize them—which in turn allows us to bring light back and progress through the levels. Stylistically the game has elements of open world and platformer, but the immersion allows for a new kind of intimacy with its protagonist.""The game is about building a relationship,"" Pillow's Willow CEO Andy Lurling said in an interview with the author. ""It's about assisting Nerow instead of directly controlling him as an avatar. There is no visual representation of the player, so there is nothing to impersonate, making contact with Nerow feel even more personal. Nerow also looks at the player every once in a while, just like normal people do.""Constraint proved to be the mother of invention for Spark of Light; some of the story mechanics grew from an understanding of the technology's capabilities.""During development one of the biggest challenges was to come up with a system that makes indirect control exciting,"" Lurling said. ""Once the concept of eternal night came up, designers figured out a way; Nerow needs to be scared of the dark. He only walks once he is near a light source. This can be done by giving Nerow fireflies that the player can collect. Fireflies can also be taken away from Nerow, to be stored into lanterns or fly-wheels: the drivers of machinery within the game.""The game makes special use of this ""dollhouse effect,"" which grew from CCO Peter Kortenhoeven's direct experience playing with his daughter.""The concept started with Peter playing in front of a dollhouse with his three-year-old daughter,"" Lurling said. ""The dollhouse perspective comes with some interesting side effects. Each piece of the dollhouse can be isolated, allowing designers to play with different scale settings within the same level. Imagine a part of the dollhouse that shows Nerow at the size of a fist and another part showing him at the size of a pinky. This is a great way to create spatial flow, similar to how movie directors can cut from an establishing shot to a close-up.""Guide Nerow, Spark of Light's protagonist, on his journey to bring light back to the world.This play with scale is one of the game's most compelling aspects; sometimes Nerow is doll-sized, and others you watch scenes play out closer to true-scale, which helps the story fully emerge. In November, when HTC Vive announced its standalone mobile headset, Vive Focus, Spark of Light was selected as a premier piece, with Kortenhoeven appearing on-stage during the keynote. And with the recent launch of Vive Focus in China, users worldwide will be able to experience Spark of Light in an even more immersive way. ""One of the unique aspects of an actual dollhouse is being able to wander around freely and to take look up close, enjoying all the details,"" Lurling said. ""While the game originally has been developed to support only rotation of the player’s head, the studio anticipated what would come next; standalone [headsets] supporting positional tracking of the player. The standalone devices really make Spark of Light come to life!""Players will also notice that Spark of Light has a unique visual atmosphere—one that particularly stands out among mobile VR games. This stems from its 'DreamLight' system, a solution that the Pillow's Willow team developed to generate the story's fairytale tone.""The biggest technical challenge was to solve the problem of using multiple lights on a mobile device, in a game that's all about 'enlightening' the world,"" Lurling said. ""That's why a unique in-house lighting system has been developed, allowing us to use a huge amount of 'DreamLights,' including effects that enrich our games with an impressionistic look that enhances the fairytale-like look.""Framed as a fairytale, players will notice an absence of violence—often a staple of games—in Spark of Light.""Traditionally publishers have been aiming for games that sell,"" Lurling said. ""It was Dr. Tom Furness who said it right in our opinion: 'Why do people buy violent games? Because they are promoted everywhere.' As VR is the most immersive type of gaming, the impact in people's brains—especially youngsters—will be even higher than with the traditional PC and console games. With our studio we want to contribute to change and social impact. Therefore our games have a focus on companionship, supporting each other and building confidence. Our objective is to show the game industry that you can produce exciting games that contain tension without using violence.""The world of 'Spark of Light.'This family-friendly approach was incorporated right from the start, and actually guided the game's design.""Taking nonviolence as a standard has influenced the design process in many ways and sometimes was a bit challenging,"" Lurling said. ""The most important one is Nerow not being allowed to die or respawn. The cool thing about Nerow not being able to die is that the game never has a hard reset, giving the player an ongoing adventure.""The design process drew upon another time-tested family friendly strategy for inspiration: tabletop games.""The studio continuously explores how VR can be experienced in the best possible way,"" Lurling said. ""Not just copying games that are played on 2D devices, but thinking about great opportunities that come from the real world, such as puzzles and board games. Nobody tells the player what happened before or what's going to be; the player forms the full center of the adventure.""ReefQuest will launch later this year.Spark of Light is the first installment in a series, and there are big plans for the next games, including ReefQuest, which drops later this year. With ReefQuest, Pillow's Willow will dramatically expand the universe experienced in Spark of Light.""[It's] a multiplayer, arcade type of game, containing a lot of replay value, using the maximum of 6DoF [Six degrees of freedom] wireless VR,"" Lurling said. ""The main characters are Octow, a cute little girl, and her mighty SeaDragon. The game takes place within the same universe as Spark of Light, but is situated below the surfaces in the oceans. Together with Octow, players go on a journey to save the oceans, its inhabitants, and the beautiful coral reefs from all kinds of dangers.""For more information about Pillow's Willow, visit the official website.

in Japan and co-author of the forthcoming Pay The Devil In Bitcoin.","Jan 18, 2018,03:53am EST","""THE Chocolate"" has been a major hit for Meiji. The packaging helped in selling over 30 million bars","Japanese manufacturer of sweets and snacks, Meiji, had an unexpected hit last year in convenience stores and supermarkets with a new line of high-end chocolate bars. The chocolate bars, with their attractive yet minimalist design and highly crafted contents were dubbed simply, meiji・THE Chocolate (明治・ザ・チョコレート). Many people in the sweets industry were dubious as to whether the chocolate bars would really take off when they were launched in September of 2016. The price they are sold for, usually around 220 yen ($1.90), is almost double that of regular chocolate bars. Yet, according to Meiji, within a year they sold 30 million bars. Ten million bars in a year is considered a successful launch in Japan's chocolate industry according to Toyo Keizai; twenty million bars in a year is a hit. Thirty million bars – a phenomenon.Second time luckyIt was the second time that Meiji attempted a gourmet chocolate bar, the last launch was in 2014 but it never took off. One of the reasons was a lack of experimentation and variation made the chocolates not very complex or interesting. This time the company tried a new approach, introducing a variety of distinct tastes--some that the typical Japanese consumer was not used to.Japanese chocolate bars are usually packaged sideways with a picture of the chocolate on the outside; Meiji broke tradition. Their chocolate bars are designed to be displayed vertically. There are several varieties of the chocolate, each box having a distinctive design and color, but all have a shiny metallic cacao bean on the cover.The cacao bean itself is an important part of what makes the bars successful. As is printed on the label, ""BEAN to BAR"" is a central concept and important part of the strategy that made the bars a hit. The company makes sure they are using high-grade beans to make their chocolate. Meiji ensures they get quality cacao beans by directly dealing with farmers overseas. The company spent a decade cultivating relationships with cacao bean growers at their place of origin and they even provide assistance in the cultivation of the product.Most companies simply purchase the cacao beans after they’ve been processed, but Meiji staff personally visit the cacao plantations overseas to inspect the plants, meet the people, and check equipment before processing. The beans are grown according to Meiji's instructions, taste-testing takes places on both sides, and there is a constant line of communication to ensure quality control.Connoisseur cultureThe Japanese have become chocolate connoisseurs, as they have with wine, so Meiji decided to cater to the market by printing the exact amount of cacao in each bar on the cover. The health benefits of dark chocolate are also widely known in Japan meaning the bars were successful in appealing to health-conscious chocolate lovers.The back of each package has a chart of the flavor, diagramming the experience of consuming the chocolate by the nut, fruit, and floral fragrance along with flavor markers for bitterness, sweetness, milkiness and acidity.Each chocolate bar has a chart on the back explaining the consumption experience according to seven... [+] factors including sweetness and floral scent.More on Forbes: Japan's Economy Looks Bright, But Here Are 7 Things That Could Affect That In 2018The package also lists the raw materials and ingredients. The design was perfect marketing for a Japan that is falling in love with Instagram, resulting in many people posting photos of the chocolate bar boxes. Fans have remade the boxes into bookmarks and then displayed their creations on social media.The attention to detail doesn’t stop with the packaging. The bars are manufactured so there are several different patterns in the chocolate pieces themselves, including a zig-zag section in some. It gives the pieces a different “mouthfeel” and a slightly different taste when you consume them.Even the individual chocolate pieces have been designed to have variety.In short, it’s possible to enjoy each bar like a glass of wine. They are currently sold in eight flavors: Comfort Bitter, Elegant Bitter, Brilliant Milk, Sunny Milk, Vivid Milk, Velvet Milk, Matcha (Green Tea) and Framboise. The Elegant Bitter can certainly be paired nicely with a red wine.Chocolate holidaysThe bars reportedly also sold well on Valentine’s Day, which is a monumentally important event for the chocolate business across the globe. Valentine's Day is particularly crucial to chocolatiers in Japan, however, because of the way it is celebrated. In Japan, it is customary for women to give chocolate to men, even their co-workers.Men, meanwhile, give women white chocolate and other candy on Japan’s made-up holiday, White Day. Japan's National Confectionery Industry Association (全国飴菓子工業協同組合) intensively popularized the holiday in the 1980s so that women could also get candy and chocolate, a month after Valentine's Day on March 14th.The many flavors of ""THE Chocolate"". Delicious at about $2 a bar.More on Forbes: Kakao Will Use Wildly Popular South Korean Webtoons To Build An Audience In Japan & ChinaFor women who feel obligated to give chocolates to the men in their lives, the cheaper chocolates are for friends and co-workers, while her “true love” is likely to get more expensive items. The semi-luxury confections Meiji produced were a perfect middle ground between cheap chocolates and expensive chocolates, so it could be given as a gift without seeming too stingy.On Valentine’s Day, Meiji also launched two limited edition flavors, a dark milk flavor and “Mexican White Cacao,” a dark chocolate made with rare white cacao beans. Both were sold at the “Olympics of Chocolatiers"" Salon du Chocolat 2017, which was held at the Tokyo International Forum this February. According to Trendy magazine, there were long lines at the Meiji booth and visitors were suitably impressed. Meiji’s new chocolate bars even won Gold and Silver Awards at the International Chocolate Awards and Superior Taste Awards from the International Taste and Quality Institute in Brussels.It may seem impossible to have a great bar of chocolate for about $2 but Meiji has delivered. Once you’ve tried “THE Chocolate” for yourself, you may never go back to eating American chocolate again."

[+] boxes.","Nestlé  may have struck gold with the release of a new type of Kit Kat made using special ""ruby"" cacao beans. The new flavor, Kit Kat Chocolatory Sublime Ruby, was launched in select stories in Japan and South Korea on January 19 and shows signs of being a hit. The first limited run of 5,000 bars in Japan has sold out and there is even a small black market–or pink market if you prefer–of people reselling the chocolates at a slightly marked up price online. Fear not, more are on the way.Last September, the Swiss chocolatier Barry Callebaut announced that they had developed a brand new type of chocolate, using ruby cacoa beans. Historically, there have only been three other types of chocolates in existence, according to the company: dark, milk and white. Ruby chocolate is ""the fourth chocolate."" The beans have a pinkish red tint and unique taste; they are cultivated in Brazil and the Ivory Coast, among other countries. Chocolate aficionados have eagerly awaited the first ruby chocolates to be released since last summer. Sublime Ruby Kit Kats on display at the main boutique store in Ginza.Turning pink into gold Nestlé claims to be the first the company to turn the beans into a product. In Japan, the Sublime Ruby Kit Kats were first sold individually at 400 yen ($3.60) for a single package from January 19-25, either at Kit Kat boutique stores or online. From February 1, you can purchase five or seven-piece assorted flavor Valentine's Day boxes, each including two Ruby Chocolate Kit Kats, that will sell for about $16 and $21 respectively. The main retail shop in Tokyo's Ginza area will also be offering a Ruby Hot Chocolate set in their cafe, that includes one Ruby Kit Kat, for 1000 yen ($9).Kit Kat has been a tremendous success in Japan, partly because the name when pronounced in Japanese, sounds like ""Kitto Katsu (きっと勝つ)""  which translates as ""you (he, she) will surely win."" The company, through clever marketing, convinced Japanese consumers that Kit Kats were auspicious gifts to give to those applying for college or seeking jobs.Flavor innovators Nestlé has launched over 350 different Kit Kat flavors over the years, including the highly successful green tea version, as well as wasabi, cherry blossoms, beni imo (vermillion potato) and even azuki bean sandwich versions. The firm never has all the flavors available at the same time, but many kinds can be purchased at airports as souvenirs or at boutique Kit Kat stores. It should be noted that some variations have been less successful than others. Last year, Throat Candy (のど飴味) flavored Kit Kats did not appear to do well. These whitish Kit Kats were poorly rated on a website devoted to appraising chocolate snacks, although you might like them, if you like medicinal mint chocolate-chip ice cream, and some ended up on the discount racks of convenience stores.The Sublime Ruby edition was designed by a top Japanese pastry chef, Yasuma Takagi, who has spearheaded many Kit Kat creations. Of course, I tried these pinkish delights before writing this. They had a distinct flavor and pleasant sourness that was slightly like a tart berry, but also with a mild sweetness that was reminiscent of milk chocolate. Chef Takagi, is quite proud of his work, commenting in press materials: ""I am extremely honored to be part of this landmark moment in the history of chocolate, with which I have worked intimately for over thirty years. I have created an especially simple Kit Kat that allows you to enjoy the characteristic fruity fragrance and subtle acidity of Ruby cacao to the fullest. Enjoy wonderful flavors that have never been experienced before.""Indeed.Nestlé  suggests that since their new Kit Kat is such a rare and precious chocolate, you should want to give some to that ""special person"" in your life on Valentine's Day. It's not a bad sales pitch. One woman who dropped by the Ginza store on January 31, Keiko Yamada, a 24-year-old receptionist, said she was sad to see that none of the Ruby Kit Kats were available that day. ""I want to get one for my boyfriend, to show him that he's really one of a kind to me. The cheaper ones I'll get for guys at the office."" She vowed to come back and try her luck again. In Japan, on Valentine's Day, traditionally women buy men chocolate, but not vice-versa.If you can't afford a ticket to Japan to buy some of these jewels, international delivery is available. It's no guarantee that these chocolate gems will arrive in time for Valentine's Day or that ""you will surely win"" the heart of your beloved but you'll probably leave a strong impression--just like the chocolates.More on Forbes: The Meteoric Rise Of Meiji: How A Japanese Chocolate Bar Took Over Instagram And Sold 30M Bars In 1 Year"

Built For This Pullback · What's Buffett's Next Move? One of the most ...","Jan 21, 2018,08:37am EST",Shutterstock,"Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) shattered growth records in 2017, with inflows topping $464 billion last year. The global ETF market now boasts more than $4.5 trillion in assets, and a large part of the appeal has been driven by dirt-cheap fees.But many of these fund’s fees are “cheap for a reason.” We’ll talk about five today that lure investors in with appealing current yields – but then proceed to dump their dumb money out the back door.These five funds may have sweet dividend yields, but they have produced sour total return results thanks to one fundamental flaw or another.ETRACS Linked to the Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index ETNDividend Yield: 8.7%One of the most basic appeals of the exchange-traded fund is the cheap diversification they provide. For just a few basis points, you can have a basket of funds that express any sort of market bet you want to make – income, growth, sector-specific, international.However, that asset can become a detriment in the event that you’re betting on a troubled area of the market with several bad players. And business development companies (BDCs) certainly apply.BDCs, which provide financing to small- and midsize companies, are similar to real estate investment trusts (REITs) in that they’re required to pay out 90% or more of their income as dividends to shareholders, and typically deliver high yields as a result. However, this field is rife with competition and interest-rate risk, which has led the ETRACS Linked to the Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index ETN to underperform the broader market since its inception despite its massive dividend yield.While there are a few good players in the space, the fund is most heavily weighted in larger BDCs such as Ares Capital and Prospect Capital – and their lackluster performance has drowned out some of the smaller winners.So while it often pays to diversify, BDCs and the BDCS ETF is an example of an unhappy exception.Horizons Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETFDividend Yield: 7.2%What would you say if I told you there was a fund that allowed you to participate in the upside of the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100, while also enjoying defense and a 7%-plus yield? Chances are you’d jump all over it.But while the Horizons Nasdaq 100 Covered Call ETF sounds great at a glance, the devil is in the details.The QYLD is one of my favorite examples of how basic indexing isn’t always the superior strategy – and that sometimes, it really pays to have active management.In this case, the ETF is trying to put the well-worn income-generation tactic of selling covered calls to work for investors, holding the Nasdaq-100 and trading options against it. This strategy allows investors to enjoy some of the Nasdaq’s upside, but also fall back on income when the index is flat or declines.The problem? QYLD has a singular mandate to trade only front-month options, limiting its flexibility (and thus profitability), and only on the Nasdaq-100 index rather than its individual stocks (where it could reap better premiums). Thus, while you could expect this kind of strategy to somewhat underperform the PowerShares QQQ Trust Nasdaq-100 ETF in a roaring bull market, the QYLD is off by nearly half!Meanwhile, the Nuveen Nasdaq 100 Dynamic Overwrite Fund – a similar but actively managed closed-end fund – charges higher fees, but has essentially matched the QQQ on its way through the clouds.iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETFDividend Yield: 5.6%In fact, there are a few other areas of the market where you can find significantly better performance by dishing out a few extra dollars every year.I shouldn’t criticize the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF too much. After all, it was a transformative product that helped bring preferred stocks – a stable source of income, but a more difficult asset to research and buy individually – into the mainstream because of its relatively low fees and easy accessibility.That said, closed-end funds, with their ability to use leverage to amplify yield and returns, have proven to be a much better way to make a general bet on preferreds – even if they’re not even remotely as popular.To wit, consider the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Income Fund, a closed-end fund that has just $163 million in assets under management at the moment. Why so unpopular? Well, the 1.34% expense ratio isn’t exactly appealing compared to 0.47% for the PFF, and there’s definitely a discrepancy in marketing spend between Flaherty and the PFF’s parent BlackRock.However, investors who can handle a bit more volatility have been treated to far better gains that more than make up the expense ratio. That’s in large part thanks to management’s expertise in the preferreds space, as well as leverage of 30% currently that allows the fund to squeeze out more income.SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETFDividend Yield: 5.6%Count junk bonds in the same category as preferreds and covered calls: The most ubiquitous ETFs in the space offer cheap, adequate performance, but you can get far better from CEFs.Consider the MFS Intermediate High Income Fund, which delivers an 8.9% yield – versus 5.6% for the popular SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF – on a portfolio whose credit risk is similar and boasts less than a year more in average effective maturity.Also important to note is that closed-end fund shops can offer specialized exposure. In other words, you can get “plain Jane” junk exposure like you get with the CIF, or you can find funds with some international allocation, or even blends of junk debt and other assets.Miller/Howard High Income Equity FundDividend Yield: 10.4%Lesson learned, then: Closed-end funds are far superior to exchange-traded funds, right?Not always.Consider the Miller/Howard High Income Equity Fund – a downright tempting CEF that delivers a double-digit yield by investing in a highly diversified portfolio of MLPs, REITs and mREITs, as well as solid high-yielding traditional equities such as AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline and Royal Dutch Shell.The fund aims to deliver high income and low volatility, but its portfolio selection – including its exposure to MLPs and REITs – has hurt the latter aim, as well as overall performance. But here, the ETF world shines. The PowerShares High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio hardly blows the doors off with its 3.1% yield, but its focus on more traditional equities has led to massive outperformance of 43% to negative 3% over the past three years. Also helping is a cheap 0.3% expense ratio, which at nearly 2 percentage points cheaper than HIE’s 2.24% fee, is a real difference-maker over time.The real lesson to take away, then? CEFs can be superior to ETFs – but you can’t just pick names out of a hat.Disclosure: none"
