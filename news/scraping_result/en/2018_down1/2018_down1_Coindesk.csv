infamous DAO project (built on the ethereum blockchain), one that puts ...","Jan 29, 2018 at 05:00 UTC",Sebastien Meunier is a financial services advisor with 15 years of experience in business innovation. He speaks on fintech and is a veteran startup mentor.,"Before we get into the speculation, let’s start with the facts – bitcoin has been declared dead more than 200 times.Despite the fact that the world’s first cryptocurrency has operated with near-100 percent uptime (for almost 10 years), it’s still fashionable to predict its demise. Even supposedly smart people are known for propagating something I’ll call “bitcoin derangement syndrome.” They keep predicting bitcoin’s demise even though they are daily proven wrong.But if we assume that these individuals possess a level of intelligence, the only explanation for the failed predictions and emotional arguments is that they never take the time to study and understand how the system works.In this way, I’d like to help by listing all the possible ways bitcoin could be destroyed.Technically speaking, bitcoin will live as long as a handful of computers run the bitcoin software on a network. Only one extreme scenario would lead to annihilation. It is likely then that it will still be the top cryptocurrency in the coming years, unless the community destroys itself due to greed or carelessness.Scenario 1: Armageddon
Likelihood (next 5 years): Close to zero
Impact: Sudden deathIf all sources of electricity, internet and data communications were shut down across the planet, bitcoin nodes would not be able to contact each other. The system would be useless.A temporary worldwide internet shutdown would certainly create confusion among the bitcoin community, but it’s important to note that the system would (theoretically) just start again from the longest chain.Even if hardcore fans or museums continue to run its software forever, bitcoin will never technically be extinct.Scenario 2: Critical bug
Likelihood (next 5 years): Low
Potential impact: Sudden irrelevanceIn this scenario, a bitcoin update could contain a bug on the level of the infamous DAO project (built on the ethereum blockchain), one that puts the integrity of the system at risk.Even if the community agreed (which is not guaranteed) to fix the code, to install the new version and to restart the system, it would certainly lead to a crash of the price and a fork.The bitcoin community is aware of the risk: any modification to the code is peer-reviewed and tested, in accordance to the contribution guidelines. That being said, only the NASA is able to produce software code with zero defect.Scenario 3: Forked to irrelevance
 Likelihood (next 5 years): Low
Potential impact: Slow irrelevanceBitcoin can be forked multiples times if the community disagrees on the path forward, for technical reasons (or “because money”).The Bitcoin Cash split, which occurred last summer, was not that harmful for bitcoin because it saw the network’s nodes and hash power decline. Theoretically, several splits could happen in which this network was further fragmented and its power reduced.Should this occur, I believe bitcoin would lose its dominance, slowly sinking into irrelevance. Again, it is the interest of the community to not let this happen.Scenario 4: Joint government crackdown
Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-low
Potential impact: Sudden irrelevanceGovernments cannot destroy bitcoin itself because of its decentralized nature. However, they can control and restrict its use in their jurisdiction.For instance, they can have the bank accounts of crypto companies closed, and they can forbid the creation of any and all related businesses. If only a handful of countries ban cryptocurrencies, the impact will be limited because businesses will simply move to friendlier jurisdictions.This is exactly what happened after China banned its domestic order-book exchanges last year. And while the likelihood that one or more governments will go after bitcoin in the same way is almost assured, I think a global ban is almost impossible (imagine the United Nations reaching such a consensus).Besides, bitcoin is already legal in Japan. If the US, EU, UK and China jointly banned cryptocurrencies, that would be very damaging.However, it is more likely that they will regulate the cryptocurrency market to collect tax revenues while protecting individual investors.Scenario 5: Major hack
Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-high
Potential impact: Temporary crashThis scenario could occur in a few different ways.In the first, called a 51 percent attack, a malicious network actor could attempt to hack the protocol itself. This is theoretically possible, but its likelihood is very low.From the inside, the 51 percent attackers would destroy their own source of profit. From the outside, it would require enormous investment in mining equipment and energy, and again the attacker’s source of profit would crash.More likely is a hack then on an application built on top of the protocol.When Mt. Gox was hacked back in 2014 (an example of this attack), it was handling 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions. Today, there are many more exchanges around the world. If one of them was hacked and a large amount of bitcoin stolen, the price would likely crash, but bitcoin would probably recover.Recently, for example, $400 million worth of NEM was stolen from the exchange Coincheck: the price of NEM only went down by 15 to 20 percent and recovered in one day.Scenario 6: “Better” cryptocurrency
Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-low
Potential impact: Slow irrelevanceIs it possible for a “better” currency to replace bitcoin? (By “better,” I mean more profitable to mine and with lower transaction costs for users, everything else being equal.)Let’s face it: this is more about economics and less about convenience. That cryptocurrency would have to be much “better” to overcome the network effect and brand capital from which bitcoin benefits today.The fact that it has not happened yet is telling. Besides, for governance and economic reasons (not a technical problem), a “universal” UN-backed cryptocurrency isn’t likely to happen within five years.There is another way economics could play out: if the price of electricity went up very significantly, mining could become unprofitable. Only large pools where electricity is relatively cheaper would remain.This is a tough cost-security trade-off. Bitcoin would have to find a way to lower the cost of security while maintaining the integrity of the ledger.Scenario 7: Market fatigue
Likelihood (next 5 years): Low
Potential impact: Slow irrelevanceIf crypto startups fail to deliver any tangible value in the real world, people could slowly start to lose faith in cryptocurrencies and tokens. (Something that arguably happened during the bear market of 2015 and 2016).In this case, the growth of the market could slow down and its value eventually stabilize. The crypto market would lose its attractiveness from an investment point of view, leading to further decline and so forth…Personally, I do believe that some crypto startups will eventually create value in the real world. In any case, the crypto market is still nascent and we still have time until it gets boring. As history has shown also, the market is always capable of bouncing back.Meteor shower via Shutterstock"

can't afford that.” It's a conversation that has surely happened ...","Jan 15, 2018 at 05:00 UTC",“How much is bitcoin?”,"“Around $14,000.”“Well, that’s too expensive. I can’t afford that.”It’s a conversation that has surely happened thousands of times over the past several months as a new swarm of people find themselves enchanted by the cryptocurrency space and its tremendous gains.And it reveals not only a misunderstanding, but also a psychological barrier that many face stepping into the scene for their first time.Since so much emphasis is placed on how much “one” bitcoin is worth across the industry, new users often come in thinking that if they want to participate, they’ll have to fork over tens of thousands of dollars to buy a whole bitcoin.But actually, that isn’t the case – it’s possible to buy a half of a bitcoin, a quarter of a bitcoin or even a fraction of a percent of a bitcoin.Yet, that’s not always clear to new people entering the market, and many believe that’s why a handful of altcoins – including dogecoin and dentacoin, both of which recently reached market caps of more than $1 billion – are seeing a pump in their price, as they offer an affordable way to get into the cryptocurrency markets in whole units.And this confusion is (partly) why developer Jimmy Song argues some standardization should occur in what the industry calls smaller units of bitcoin.Toward this goal, Song released a standards proposal that seeks to express one one-millionth of a bitcoin (about one cent at today’s prices) as a “bit.” And he’s nudging wallet providers, exchanges and other bitcoin businesses to support the proposal.If widely adopted, he hopes it will put an end to this confusion, and make new crypto users more apt to purchase bitcoin, if even in tiny amounts, instead of cryptocurrencies that he thinks might come back to bite them, since many of the cheap altcoins don’t have much technical merit to back them up.The problem now is that more traditional dollar units, such as $5, when converted to bitcoin look daunting and messy – at 0.000345 bitcoin.But with Song’s proposal – which he’s released in the form of a bitcoin improvement proposal, or BIP – that dollar value would instead be 345 bits, still a mental juggle, but arguably less confusing, since it’s in whole numbers and not decimals.“For whatever psychological reason, normal people have trouble understanding decimals and fractions. $0.002 is weirder than $200.00,” said Erik Voorhees, co-founder and CEO of ShapeShift, which supports Song’s proposal, adding:“For bitcoin to be a global, commonly used currency, it would certainly be helpful to have a denomination that allows people to express prices in integers (2,000 bits for a coffee) rather than a decimal.”Adding to the mental benefits, Song also said the standardizing “bit” would remove what he calls “unit bias.”According to Song, people don’t like having what looks like such a small amount of bitcoin, or money in general for that matter. Bitcoin’s price rise at the end of 2017, only exacerbated that problem, adding even more zeros in between the positive numbers and the decimal.Poking fun at all the recent bitcoin forks, Song said, a group of people could have success enticing a new wave of crypto buyers by splitting off bitcoin with the goal of moving bitcoin’s decimal system six positions.While others have proposed similar unit changes in the past, Song’s proposal seems to be gaining transaction with exchanges and other companies, which is all the proposal needs to succeed – getting businesses to use the unit to display not only how much bitcoin is in an individual’s wallet but also, within merchants stores, how much things cost.And even though, Song’s proposal is targeted at bitcoin, it could serve as an outline for how other cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum, could update their units to be more user-friendly.Although the idea of the proposal is to limit confusion, it’s garnered its fair share of criticism, with those against claiming it could add to the confusion instead.The critics say, for instance, that if not all companies roll out the standard at the same time – and ShapeShift uses “bits,” while Coinbase sticks with “bitcoin” – when sending bitcoin from one wallet to another, they could either think they somehow earned money or lost money.Voorhees, for one, even agreed this was a concern, but argued that it shouldn’t stop bitcoin companies from eventually adopting the standard.“There will undoubtedly be some mistakes and friction as the new term gains usage, but for the purpose of language and mathematical simplification, the net result should be beneficial to bitcoin’s adoption,” he said.Meanwhile, Song stressed that even though he thinks it would be a move in the right direction, like most things in the cryptocurrency world, it’s up to the community to decide if they want to adopt the system or not.Still, many more exchanges and businesses would need to adopt the change to get the ball rolling. Song has been tweeting at various exchanges and companies – including CoinMarketCap, one of the most popular sites for checking cryptocurrency prices – suggesting they move to “bits.”Song concluded:“This is meant to be a community-driven initiative and the benefits will hopefully be obvious to businesses.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Shapeshift. Broken bitcoin image via Shutterstock"

However, that did not happen.The cryptocurrency opened today’s session at $13,585, and reached a high of $13,601 before the sudden tumble at soon after 07:00 UTC that saw the price drop from $13,210 down to $11,850 at 08:30 UTC. That’s a fall of $1,360 in just 1.5 hours.The drop puts the price of a bitcoin at a month low. Dec. 5 saw bitcoin at a similar level, however, that was when the cryptocurrency was climbing fast on the way to setting a new price record around $20,000, as the launch of bitcoin futures contracts from CME Group and CBOE was being anticipated by the trading community.At press time, bitcoin had recovered slightly, and was trading at $12,195 – down 10 percent for today, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.The news comes as the wider cryptocurrency market is seeing losses. All the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are in the red today, with ethereum down 14 percent, Ripple down 21 percent and bitcoin cash down 19 percent over the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.The overall market cap for all tokens is at $584.9 billion at press time – down from a high of $832 billion on Jan. 7.Skydivers image via Shutterstock"

Back then, the RSI was just shy of oversold conditionsStill, it appears to be too early to call a bottom.Yesterday’s long-tailed candle (big difference between intraday low and UTC close) does show strong dip demand. However, only a positive close today would validate the sharp recovery from $9,005 (previous day’s low).The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:Except for the first point, all other factors favor a drop to $8,690–$8,052 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 2017 rally).Creepy forest trail image via Shutterstock"

The initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017 saw unprecedented levels of funds raised in a non-traditional form. CoinDesk’s ICO tracker logged over $3.5 billion in funds raised via ICOs!On top of the ICO explosion we also saw another type of boom: in a new type of bitcoin fork that has come to be known as an “altcoin airdrop.”While most of the crypto assets in existence have been created via software forks of Bitcoin Core, they have historically started with a new genesis block and thus a new distribution scheme for the tokens themselves.You can see a fairly complete list of the airdrops at btcdiv.com, but many of them don’t even show up on market cap lists because they have little value.From looking at the top few forks you could claim that about $50 billion in value was created/raised via bitcoin forks in 2017. As an engineer who had to deal with the fallout from the fork frenzy, it became tiring pretty quickly as it was clear that the vast majority of these forks would not have sufficient value to warrant spending scarce developer resources trying to support them.No, @BitGo has no plans to support:Bitcoin PlatinumBitcoin DiamondBitcoin RubyBitcoin Cash PlusBitcoin ClashicBitcoin UraniumBitcoin SilverBitcoin HotBitcoin GodBitcoinGBitcoinStakeBitcoin BlueBitcoin FaithBitcoin PizzaSuper BitcoinLightning BitcoinUnitedBitcoin— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 15, 2017At a protocol level, there was a great deal of work done in 2017.

It’s also roughly the amount of space the bitcoin blockchain currently requires.These bloating storage requirements are a longstanding problem for the community’s efforts to keep bitcoin decentralized. But Bitcoin Core contributor and maintainer Jonas Schnelli has spent the past few years trying to make full nodes easier to run for a wider audience despite this huge data cost – and in turn, make bitcoin more resistant to centralization.With so much information to download, setting up a bitcoin full node currently takes days or even weeks. This issue was at the heart of bitcoin’s years-long scaling debate. While increasing transaction capacity by raising the block size limit might have eased the network’s steadily rising transaction fees, it also would have disqualified more users from running bitcoin’s core infrastructure.And even though the block size held steady, the pressures favoring centralization remain, because of the storage space and time it takes to set up a full node.Yet, developers argue that running a full node is the best way to use bitcoin (some even going as far as to claim that without a full node to validate bitcoin transactions themselves, users are just wasting their time on cryptocurrency). In this way, users take full advantage of all bitcoin’s benefits, including censorship-resistance and the minimization of trust in third parties.“It’s very important to run bitcoin full nodes. It’s the main or at least a significant reason to use bitcoin,” Schnelli told CoinDesk. “If we throw that away we lose one of the more interesting parts of bitcoin.”Schnelli’s particular focus is on making Bitcoin Core, the most popular bitcoin software implementation, more user-friendly, for people he calls “non-geeks.”And he feels, perhaps, a stronger commitment than most to this cause, saying:“I think it’s our duty as developers to make it possible to run full nodes.”To be sure, you could argue that most of the 15,000 updates to the codebase implemented over the years are geared toward the same goal, making bitcoin more efficient and faster to download.Yet, Schnelli is specifically focused on the software’s user experience, coming up with creative ways to make it easier for people to run these full nodes.And Schnelli doesn’t want those full nodes leashed to the places they were set up, such as a user’s desktop computer at home or the office, where it can only verify transactions from one location.Instead, Schnelli wants bitcoin full nodes to be mobile.“We’ve almost reached that goal,” he said, adding that other developers have been helping him bring recent additions to Bitcoin Core – such the ability to load multiple separate wallets when starting the software – that would help bring full node mobility to fruition.Once all the pieces are in place, users will be able to securely connect smartphone wallets to their full nodes running from home.Further, Schnelli is developing a hybrid Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) mode, which allows users waiting for their full node to download to still use Bitcoin Core to validate and make transactions in the meantime.With an SPV wallet, the user has some information about the bitcoin transaction history, but must rely on trusting other full nodes to ultimately verify transactions.This scenario is one many bitcoin developers would like to avoid, but it would only be used for the time it takes to download the full node.Depending on the hardware and internet speeds being used to download a full node, the process can take days, and sometimes, weeks – which is an “unacceptable user experience,” Schnelli said. Hence the need for some kind of connection in the interim.And once the full node download is complete, the software switches back to the more secure full node.Another project Schnelli is getting started on, in an effort to cut down the time it takes to set up a full node, is building devices that already have a bitcoin full node downloaded and set up on them.This comes from the knowledge that users generally need to buy “dedicated hardware,” which can cost a few hundred dollars, to run bitcoin full nodes.Also the co-founder of hardware wallet Digital Bitbox, Schnelli is calling the project a “full node in a box.” He hopes to sell those devices in the future. While unsure how much they would cost, he said they would save a lot of time.“You could have a black box similar to an Apple TV or router that you just plug in and it works,” he said.There are similar full node-only devices on the market, “but not in a way that I think is useful,” Schnelli said. “It’s hard to get affordable hardware that syncs pretty fast,” and building a “good” full node device requires knowing the ins and outs of the Bitcoin Core code.BitSeed devices, for example, cost between $200 and $350. Schnelli said he thinks he can ship a product that slashes this cost, partly by doing the marketing required to attract a few hundred or thousand buyers.Schnelli envisions the “full-node-in-a-box” device as a computerized auditor someone would run in their home to ensure their bitcoin finances are in check. Less entertaining than streaming television shows on an Apple TV, but perhaps producing greater satisfaction in the long run.Jonas Schnelli image via San Francisco bitcoin developers video"

The session was moderated by Yang Yanquing, deputy editor-in-chief of Chinese finance media conglomerate Yicai.Shiller, who previously said he thought bitcoin was too ambiguous to put a price on, called the cryptocurrency a “really clever idea” during the event, but suggested that the tech might be better applied elsewhere.“I’m impressed by the technology,” he remarked. “And it is spreading in certain quarters, there are certain people who love this. But it seems to me it’s technology for something else. It’s gone viral as a currency. Blockchain is important, but it’s not stable.”Scott struck a critical tone, calling bitcoin “a very lousy currency.” Skingsley echoed this sentiment, arguing that a currency needs to have price stability and widespread acceptance in order to be efficient.She continued:“In my view, cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and the others – they don’t meet the criteria for money. They can be called an asset but they’re not a stable store of value, they fluctuate a lot, and you can’t use them as a medium of exchange.”Index Ventures’ Rimer called bitcoin “one of the most audacious, generous and profound inventions” that he has ever seen, pointing out that it is only nine years old. He then went on to offer a rebuttal of sorts to the more critical take.“We’re nine years into this experiment. It’s gone well at times and quite poorly. It could fail completely and go to zero, but it has accomplished a number of things I think are remarkable,” he said during the panel.Scott later commented on the discussion around price movements – mentioning the rise above $10,000 in particular – as a kind of distraction to the bigger picture involved.She remarked:“The fact that people keep talking today that bitcoin is below 10,000, it’s a disaster, or bitcoin is above 10,000 and that’s crazy. I think the fact that bitcoin is still alive, and attracting so much attention, the fact that we’re talking about bitcoin in Davos with a Nobel Prize winner, a central bank governor and a seasoned investor, I think that’s a powerful tool.”While the panelists seemed to agree on bitcoin’s nature, there was a note of uncertainty about its future between those on the panel.Scott implied that a stable cryptocurrency in 10 years might look drastically different from bitcoin today, comparing it to discussions about MySpace’s success a prior ago. Rimer advocated for more regulation, saying that any truly innovative technology would need to work within existing regulatory frameworks – or at least push against them “responsibly” – in order to leave a lasting impact.The WEF event has thus far featured a range of comments from world leaders on the topic of crypto, including U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.Panel image via the World Economic Forum"

You wake up in your bed and believe
whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland,
and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”
– Morpheus, “The Matrix” (1999)I grew up the son of a personal injury lawyer in New York and have been exposed to the law my entire life. I worked in Washington, D.C. for nearly 10 years at one of the largest and fanciest law firms in the country before I started my own firm. I have even represented high-profile and high-net-worth people and companies.None of this fully prepared me for my entry into the world of digital currency. It was like Keanu Reeves entering his own digital world in “The Matrix,” and it happened at a South Beach bar in 2014.After a few drinks, one of my friends took out his smartphone and sent me 5 BTC to impress our other friends. Much like when Neo swallowed the red pill that was offered to him, getting those bitcoin introduced me to a Wonderland in which I learn every day how much deeper the rabbit hole goes. (By the way: Thank you, unnamed friend! I have yet to move those bitcoin and have them sitting in the same wallet where you placed them almost four years ago!)But I’m also active in the industry in another way.In the last three years, I have filed lawsuits against Cryptsy, Coinbase, Kraken, Tezos and Monkey Capital to name a few. More lawsuits are coming in the days, weeks and months ahead. Dare I say, I have filed more litigation in this space than any other lawyer in the country. I travel the country speaking at conferences, lectures and on TV.I have been quoted in articles published by CoinDesk, Reuters, Bloomberg and The Financial Times regarding cryptocurrency and bitcoin as an investment.People ask me all the time: “Is bitcoin a good investment? If so, where should I buy it?”From my unique perspective in the cryptocurrency Wonderland, I tell those people: “I have absolutely no $#@#$!% idea whether the price of bitcoin is going up or down, what alternative cryptocurrency you should buy to invest in today, or where you should buy it!”The next question is usually: “Seriously, what should I do?” I can only laugh and think to myself: “If I knew the answer, I would invest myself.” For your information, I don’t; simply because I do not know what the price of bitcoin is going to do. If I did, I would have invested in 2014 after my friend gave me those first five bitcoin.What I do know, and what I can speak about somewhat intelligently, is the universal myth that currently exists for people who are first experiencing cryptocurrencies: that all U.S.-based crypto exchanges are the same.This myth is the single biggest threat to any investor money in this space. KNOW. YOUR. EXCHANGE.There is a difference between Bittrex, Poloniex, Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini and several other lesser-known exchanges. They are not the same. The prices of your crypto on the exchanges are different, the rules and regulations they follow are different, the security is different and the quality of leadership is different.How each exchange handles challenges and adversity is different. I’m not here to endorse any of the different exchanges, but I can tell you that each one secures customer assets, handles customer issues and provides support differently. Some are akin to legitimate banks; others are more like Bernie Madoff, with the appearance of sophistication and wealth while in reality, they are just common thieves and fraudsters.What happens when a flash crash occurs and clients lose money? What happens when that flash crash only occurs on one exchange but not others? What happens when that exchange happens to provide customers with margin trading like a traditional investment house but denies that those rules apply to them? What law applies and what government agencies have the power to enforce the theoretical laws that apply? When catastrophe strikes, what happens?Some exchanges respond to catastrophic events by refunding their customer accounts, other exchanges tell customers they’re #@$% out of luck.While the latter might be good for my business – because wrongfully imposed customer losses are where lawsuits are usually born – that’s not good for the consumer.If you have ever heard me speak on this topic, you know I am a passionate believer that regulation is coming and that it’s going to come hard and fast in the U.S.That day of reckoning will collapse the weaker exchanges. Which exchanges will survive? Typically, those with the best leadership and that operate with transparency will rise to the top. As for those that fail?Good luck collecting on your losses if you had entrusted your crypto to one of those exchanges. It’s expensive, time consuming and you never know how it will turn out.As for which ICOs are viable and which ones are not, the ability to pick a winner might be a bit easier.The answer there is: None of them have yet proven themselves to be winners; and any of them that look like winners might not in the near future once Uncle Sam and his relatives around the world wrap their hands around ICOs and crypto-related investments.While I believe that more people are going to join the bitcoin and cryptocurrency parade, regulation and government intervention are going to change all the rules. I have been caught on camera advising crypto companies to get a 100 percent guarantee of free legal defense fees if their companies relied on legal advice at $1,000+/hour and that advice turns out to be flat wrong.Some of my lawsuits and the lawsuits of others will demonstrate that the fallacies that some of these companies are promoting flagrantly violate of the law. There has yet to be an ICO that did not perform that was not a security.There, I said it. I’m sure that lost in the flood of investment opportunities is the next potential Amazon or Netflix, but for now, the safety of more traditional investments is the right choice for most people.I find it odd and incredibly ironic that the self-proclaimed thought leaders on regulatory advice at the largest law firms charging the most per hour are the same lawyers telling media outlets that people should only invest in a crypto company an amount they can afford to lose.That’s terrible legal advice and terrible investment advice.In the crypto Wonderland, an educated consumer is the best consumer.To be clear, just because my firm is involved in litigation against an exchange or a company that raised funds via an ICO does not mean that exchange or ICO won’t survive or isn’t legitimate.To paraphrase the fictional character Amy Gardner on the TV show “The West Wing”:“I’ve been crazy about [crypto] for longer than you’ve known [about it]. And I’ll keep poking [it] with a stick. That’s how I show my love.”I show my love to protect my clients who were early adopters in this space and have been blown out of it by companies who believe they are above the law. I hold companies accountable as they grow and scale, and I’ll keep poking those companies with my lawsuits. That does not mean I love those companies or crypto any less. As these companies grow, scale, and legitimize in the U.S., they will learn that with responsibility comes accountability.What you say and what you do matters. If you don’t believe that, either the government or a process server with a Complaint from Silver Miller is headed your way.The upcoming year is going to be a wild ride for this space.At FinTech 2017 in Washington, D.C., some people even claimed that 2018 is going to be “The Year of Crypto Litigation.” They’re probably right. However, if there is litigation, that means people have lost their money. That’s not good for crypto consumers or crypto businesses. I hope 2018 is the year of transparency and serviceable regulation.A pinch here and a pinch there, not too little and certainly not too much. While many of my clients began as anarchists- and libertarians-at-heart, their focus changed when bad actors did bad things to them.When someone steals your money and you lose that which you believe belongs to you, you seek justice.In the U.S., justice requires law and order. In one of my cases, we had to get a federal court judge to order the return to my clients of 11,000+ stolen bitcoin, presently valued at over $150 million. When my clients had their bitcoin stolen from them, they stopped caring so much about decentralization and autonomous and anonymous transactions.At that point, they simply cared about their missing cryptocurrency.And in an ironic twist of fate, the person who helped my clients regain their faith in the non-governmentally-regulated world of cryptocurrency was… a government officer with a robe and a gavel. Maybe some government intervention into the crypto Wonderland isn’t so bad after all.Internet crime image via Shutterstock"

Launched today, a number of tools collectively identified as Crystal are intended to make it easy for users to identify and investigate criminal activity on the world’s largest blockchain.But that’s not to say that the end goal of Crystal is philanthropic.Developed over a two-year period with feedback from former senior-level government officials, the platform was ultimately created to help bitcoin once and for all move past its association with black market transactions.The next time potential Bitfury customers balk at getting involved with the cryptocurrency, the CEO of Bitfury Group, Valery Vavilov hopes Crystal will provide a solution.Vavilov told CoinDesk:“The industry needs some very user-friendly tools so that you can track bitcoin transactions and see if this bitcoin address that you’re getting money from is green or black.”Beginning today, a free demo license of the Crystal software will be made available to qualified individuals, with pricing for web and enterprise subscriptions to be released in March.The core of the toolkit is a detailed risk scoring solution that helps law enforcement agents and investigators trace suspicious transactions to a final address, or a point of withdrawal. By tracking the relationships between so-called “bad actors,” Crystal will generate a score of the likelihood a particular address is related to illegal activity.The results of the data analysis are then presented in a visual graph that can be integrated with other software tools and used to prepare legal reports as part of larger investigations.Other tools enable the autonomous tracking of bitcoin addresses over time, custom reports that can be sent based on predetermined criteria or triggered by transactions between  groups and advanced services that include previously revealed technology for “untangling” transactions that have been sent through laundering software, called mixers.“We are analyzing the web, we are analyzing the forums, we are analyzing different kinds of sources, and combining this information and getting some kind of result if this transaction is risky or not,” said Vavilov.Overall, Bitfury’s entrance into the bitcoin security space marks the latest expansion for the company, founded in 2012 as a bitcoin mining startup.As part of a larger push to gain industry adoption of blockchain technology, Bitfury last year entered the blockchain industry more broadly, with the launch of Exonum, its own blockchain infrastructure aimed at enterprise users.Now, to further distinguish Bitfury’s enterprise offering, Crystal Pro will be deployable in a customer’s in-house architecture, a service designed to extend beyond simply tracking bitcoin transactions and into providing an additional security layer for bitcoin companies.The expansion is important, as a niche industry surrounding blockchain analytics has emerged over the past couple years.Among the most notable competitors offering users a way to investigate the bitcoin blockchain are Elliptic, which has raised $5 million, Chainalysis, which has raised $1.6 million, and Skry, which was last year acquired by Bloq.“The bottom line is it is very critical for the blockchain and all of this technology to really advance,” said Bitfury global chief communications officer and former White House deputy press secretary Jamie Smith.She added:“And if bad people are doing bad things, then nobody really benefits that’s not in anyone’s interest.”The origin of Crystal goes back to about 2015, when Bitfury was working to help overcome the reluctance of financial institutions and government agencies who were curious about the cryptocurrency.At the time, Bitfury had just helped kick off the first Blockchain Summit in 2014 at bitcoin supporter and billionaire Richard Branson’s personal retreat, Necker Island.Gathered at the event were numerous blockchain entrepreneurs, several people from Bitfury — and former 15-year veteran of the U.S. Department of Justice, Jason Weinstein, who played a crucial role in inspiring Crystal.According to Smith, it was at Necker Island where the seeds were first sown for the Blockchain Alliance to explore how private companies could join in the public fight against criminal activity.Weinstein, who now directs the alliance is also a strategic advisor to Bitfury confirmed Smith’s story.He reflected:“I’ve often said that bitcoin is friendlier to cops than it is to crooks, and that criminals should run, not walk, away from using bitcoin. With Crystal, they should be running away even faster.”Disclaimer: Bitfury global communications officer Jamie Smith is a member of CoinDesk’s advisory board.Badge and handcuffs via the company"

advisor of blockchain research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative.","Jan 9, 2018 at 09:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"I am frustrated by the debate over whether or not bitcoin is an environmental disaster waiting to happen.No one seems to know what assumptions to use. Depending on what efficiency ratios we assume for currently operating ASIC mining rigs, they’re either consuming 35 terawatt-hours per year, the equivalent of Denmark, or something far less, closer perhaps to Bolivia. The stinginess of mining pools to provide information about their operations can be partly blamed for this.We also don’t know how much of mining runs on low-carbon energy, such as the mining farms that use geothermal energy in Iceland or hydropower in Washington State. Surely that matters.And then there’s the “compared to what?” question.If bitcoin is to be assessed as an alternative to fiat currencies, banks and traditional payment systems, then we must consider the costs of securing those systems – the physical bank branches, the armored cars, the staff employed in fraud detection, and so forth.While only a portion of those legacy costs goes to energy consumption, savings from foregoing those costs could be put toward constructive uses for humankind, such as building more renewable energy sources.But then, what metric do we use to compare bitcoin to banks? Bitcoin is still a pipsqueak compared with the total value of fiat transactions, which still means its energy consumption is proportionately very high. Motherboard recently claimed that one bitcoin transaction uses as much electricity as the  average house does in a week.Still, we all know that transaction growth on the network has slowed due to congestion and a fixed block size. So, as rising bitcoin prices keep enticing miners to add more hashing power, the numerator is increasing while the denominator stays steady, resulting in a massive surge in per-transaction electricity.And while that’s hardly a shining endorsement for bitcoin, it’s less of a critique of its energy efficiency than of its scaling challenges.Which brings me to an even bigger gripe I have with the ill-defined bitcoin energy debate, which is that too many people assume that technology remains static, perhaps without thinking.That’s a crazy assumption for an industry in which intense competition for block rewards and an open-source developer pool come together in a dynamic cauldron of development. Technological advances in both cryptocurrencies and energy are changing more rapidly than any of us can keep up with. We must keep that in mind.On that note, point number one: Lightning is coming. While its payment channels solution isn’t specifically aimed at energy efficiency, if we think about the cost issue as a per-transaction metric, it could help making bitcoin less damaging to the environment – at least when assessed relative to its utility as a payments service.Whether Lightning succeeds in encouraging more people to use bitcoin for small transactions, rather than hoarding it to capture price gains, remains to be seen. But if you compare what it costs to run the tiny amount of computer processing power to send peer-to-peer payments over a network of Lightning channels against those of the banking and infrastructure needed to process card payments over the Visa network, this future model for bitcoin starts to look far more efficient.Point number two comes via Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh, who astutely argued that the more miners are enticed to compete for bitcoin – again, a function of its rising price – the more they are encouraged to seek ever-more efficient sources of power to boost margins and secure an advantage over others.With the price of solar and wind energy in some places  now at 2 cents per KwH or lower, that search will increasingly lead them in the direction of renewable sources.Where the argument gets really interesting is when we assume that a rising bitcoin price will drive demand for hashing power so high that the network, as some alarmists say,  will consume more power than the U.S. by 2019.If that happens, then it should not only incentivize miners to seek low-cost renewable energy, but also drive energy firms to work hard at developing solutions for them, with spillover benefits for the rest of the world.In other words, the incentives that bitcoin demand puts in place could not only drive efficiency and green energy solutions in the crypto world but help to spur them in the wider economy too.In retrospect, Van Valkenburgh’s point should have been blindingly obvious to all familiar with how Moore’s Law and the incentives of economic competition have driven technology toward greater efficiency for the past 50 years.It wasn’t obvious because, as I mentioned, people tend to think in terms of a stasis. They fail to see the dynamic feedback loops generated by rapidly changing technologies such as bitcoin.This, I think is the most important lesson from the many debates that roil the bitcoin community.In an industry where technological change – rapid, relentless technological change – is the only constant, any debate about the future must acknowledge it as a variable.Solar power image via Shutterstock"

At the time, the rapper was accepting payments through processor startup BitPay.

security ...","Feb 3, 2018 at 12:15 UTC","“Grumpynitis,” as he’s known on Reddit, figured he had taken every precaution he needed to protect his crypto assets. ","After all, he worked as a security consultant to banks, governments and multinationals. He knew how to thwart hackers.Then he read about the armed robbery. And the kidnapping. And the swatting. And he grew, in his words, “quite paranoid,” as he continued to perform his day job and realized the magnitude of the new threats the community was facing. “It makes you think about what could happen one day,” Grumpy told CoinDesk in an email. Shaken, he started taking measures he previously didn’t think necessary.This should set off alarm bells for non-experts. As cryptocurrency values have climbed, many users have suddenly become very wealthy – and consequently turned into prospective targets for offline criminals as much as online ones. A number of investors are on high alert and trying to keep low profiles, realizing that not only their money may be at risk, but also their personal safety. Like Grumpy (who, for obvious reasons, did not want to give his real name or other identifying details), they’re taking extra steps to protect their coins – and themselves.  But there’s growing concern that not enough users are being so cautious in light of the heightened hazards.“People, time to change the dialogue,” cryptographer Ian Grigg recently tweeted, adding: “Never ever ask someone how much crypto they have, or what crypto they have. Lives are now in danger.”Illustrating the perils facing market participants, in December, Pavel Lerner, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Exmo Finance, was released from the custody of kidnappers after a $1 million bitcoin ransom was paid.This followed an incident last fall in which New York authorities reported the armed robbery of someone in possession of $1.8 million-worth of ether. And while it was probably motivated by malice more than greed, a swatting attack on BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp by “angry crypto fans” highlighted how security concerns have spilled over from cyberspace into meatspace. A battalion of local law enforcement cordoned off Lopp’s North Carolina neighborhood in response to a false report of hostage incident. It’s against that backdrop that users like Grumpy are adjusting their threat models.Previously, Grumpy stored the private keys to his cryptocurrency using an ingenious strategy of embedding an encrypted vault in a video file.But he’s switched to the Ledger Nano S, a pocket-sized hardware wallet. “Storing the private keys in a vault is good for cold storage, but when you want to use the wallet, you’ll have to expose your key to your PC,” Grumpy said. A device like the Ledger, on the other hand, keeps the keys unexposed even when plugged into a computer that’s connected to the internet. Instead, the hardware wallet sends a signed message. Still, Grumpy wasn’t taking any chances. After receiving the Ledger in the mail, Grumpy took the thing apart to verify the chips. He also double-checked the signatures that are generated by the device.“This to be 99.99 percent sure that the device itself is genuine and that it hasn’t been tampered with,” he said.This level of care underscores the added level of personal responsibility the crypto world now faces in a new security environment.“It’s like moving from an apartment where building security is already provided, to a private home where you are responsible for your own security,” William Mougayar, the author and investor, told CoinDesk.Most consumers, he said, have yet to make the mental jump to this new reality, which requires not only new skills and know-how but, critically, self-discipline.“An eight-letter password in your head is no longer sufficient,” Mougayar said.Multi-factor authentication, multi-signature arrangements, paper wallets (best kept in a safe), hardware devices like the Ledger, PIN codes and recovery phrases are now all baseline measures. Yet, much of this is too complicated for the average consumer, Mougayar said.“It is my hope that we will see more user-friendly ways to manage security and privacy in this new crypto-world,” he said. “Security usability is an industry challenge, that, once improved, will help to increase adoption by orders of magnitude. Security and usability can, and should be able to coexist.”But beyond all these measures, users will have to learn the importance of discretion.Asked why someone would ever admit how much crypto they own, Grigg tweeted in response that, “people in the bitcoin world are still too proud to realize that answering is a bad idea.”After inspecting his Ledger, Grumpy generated a seed phrase, or backup recovery text, on the ledger. This phrase itself would have never seen a PC, he noted. The seed was 24 words, and he divided them over 3 pieces of paper. Each piece of paper contained 16 words.  Grumpy stored the three papers in safe places outside his home in tamper-evident envelopes (he recommends Tyveks) that are stored securely. Any two of these three papers can be used to reconstruct the seed. A few people know about these and know where they are stored, he said.“Since one paper is worthless, I don’t have to worry about theft,” he said.All this may make the Ledger sound like a high-maintenance device, but it’s been a hot seller of late.Eric Larcheveque, CEO of Ledger, said his company had seen a 300-times year-on-year uptick in sales, thanks to the massive growth of the cryptocurrency market. The French company’s Nano S hardware wallet devices have proved the most popular, with about 1 million sold in 2017. “With the increase of advanced exploits on general computing devices and secure enclaves (Meltdown, Spectre, Rowhammer, Clkscrew) the need for hardware wallets and external security devices that can be fully validated by the user has been more and more important and will continue to grow in 2018,” he predicted.Much like Grumpy was shocked out of complacency by the grisly news reports, Lopp said his eyes were opened by the swatting attack on his home, as well as the armed robbery in which the victim was lured into a van and held at gunpoint.Lopp calls the latter incident a “rubber hose” attack. Though they may not involve actually being beaten with one, the effect is the same.While he has been a constant target online since rising to prominence several years ago as a passionate voice in the crypto community, “bringing it into the physical world made me realize that I’m at a new level where I have to worry about the random crackpot threatening me in real life,” Lopp told CoinDesk.The engineer said he has now “reviewed some of his physical security practices and invested some time and resources in a few changes that will give me even more peace of mind.”He declined to specify what those other changes were, but suggested anyone interested in beefing up their personal security read up on home defense.If you get taken hostage, Lopp said, the only way to make it out without losing money is to not have direct access to your funds. In a post on  Medium in 2014, Lopp suggested that at the level of investment-tier asset holdings, you’d want to have cold storage that requires multiple individuals to access. He recommended paper wallets with split keys via Shamir’s Secret Sharing algorithm or storage of assets in multi-signature addresses.Lopp made for an ironic target – as he tells CoinDesk, he already had “pretty good physical security practices.”“Over the years I’ve educated myself in hand-to-hand, knife and firearm combat,” he said, adding that he’s received tactical training from a variety of experts and has applied “a great number of best practices to my home to fortify it against various types of intrusions.”“These things aren’t specific to the crypto space; physical security is a well-understood problem that any prominent people have to worry about,” he said.But he said that a select number of even higher profile individuals could even someday be forced to hire bodyguards for true peace of mind.Grumpynitis isn’t going that far – but he is thinking ahead. If one of the envelopes holding the three pieces of paper gets damaged or stolen, he said, it should give him enough time to transfer the funds. But if he dies, trustworthy acquaintances can reconstruct the seed to recover the funds. If he loses the funds one day and the secured envelopes are still intact, he won’t have to blame the persons he gave an envelope to.He concluded:“If something happens to the seed and one envelope has been opened, you know where it went wrong.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo and Ledger. Safe image via Shutterstock"

average transaction fee has soared to $19, turning bitcoin's old claim to 
fame ...","Jan 23, 2018 at 05:09 UTC",Rising fees seem to be the only thing people talk about in the bitcoin world these days.,"The crypto space is full of frustration and vitriol on the topic, as the average transaction fee has soared to $19, turning bitcoin’s old claim to fame as a cheaper online payment method into a laughable assertion.But despite these increasing costs, and the long-running debate they’ve caused, developers and users argue there are simple ways to decrease fees that aren’t being fully taken advantage of.This point was raised recently when new data came to light suggesting that one bitcoin startup, Coinbase, singlehandedly facilitates as many as half of all bitcoin transactions, based on the drop in overall network volume when the U.S.-based exchange went offline for a couple hours on Jan. 11.The problem with that situation, according to critics, is the company could singlehandedly save users (not only its own but other companies’ customers as well) a bundle on their transactions by implementing a couple technical features, namely Segregated Witness (SegWit).And since the code change for SegWit was activated on bitcoin nearly six months ago, many are upset Coinbase hasn’t yet implemented it.Sergej Kotliar, the CEO of payment provider Bitrefill, called the new data a “smoking gun” in that it shows how much of bitcoin’s limited transaction space Coinbase is using up. The pseudonymous blogger WhalePanda went so far as to blame bitcoin’s transaction backlogs and high fees on the Silicon Valley startup’s “incompetence.”Patience is running especially thin as it relates to Coinbase, since the startup was one of the more vocal during bitcoin’s block size debate, complaining about high fees and arguing that an increase in the block size parameter would help alleviate those expenses.Yet, critics argue, the company really shouldn’t be complaining since it’s not doing everything it can to push fees lower.In response, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to stress that the company is working on rolling out technical features to reduce fees, but hinted that it’s not easy. “Thanks for bearing with us!” he said. (Coinbase declined to comment for this story).But should users not be interested in enduring the fees for transacting, there are several possible ways to reduce them today.SegWit was lauded as the optimization that would help bitcoin scale without upping the block size during last year’s scaling debates – yet only 12% of bitcoin transactions take advantage of the technology, even though SegWit transactions cost half as much as normal transactions.Not all wallets currently have SegWit capability, but hardware wallets Trezor and Ledger support it and mobile wallets such as Edge (formerly Airbitz) and privacy-minded Samourai Wallet do as well.But for users who don’t want to go through the trouble of switching providers, SegWit capability is on its way at other companies too.Coinbase and Blockchain.info are working on implementations, for example, but both have emphasized that SegWit is a new and complex change that they need to take their time with – they could lose user funds if a big enough mistake occurred.Overall though, as the number of companies supporting the new feature grows, bitcoin fees will decrease – some even argue that transaction fees would disappear altogether if SegWit transactions replaced normal transactions.But if fees aren’t eliminated altogether, a more specific type of SegWit address is in the works, which could potentially save users more in the future.But while users wait for mass SegWit adoption, they can reduce fees individually using fee estimators.Although early bitcoin wallets didn’t let users choose fees, this has changed, with many bitcoin wallets providing fee estimator tools to help users decide how much of a fee they should attach to their transaction to get it through the network in a timely manner.In short, the higher the fee, the quicker the transaction will get added to a block, but on the other hand, users don’t want to overpay. New fee estimator tools try to help users strike the right balance.That said, some estimators are better than others.Some users check with standalone tools that consider different factors, such as the estimator from University of Freiburg computer science researcher Jochen Hoenicke, which gives a good idea of what fee is required to get your transaction into the next block.Another from Coinb.in considers transaction complexity – such as how much data is sent with the transaction. Fees also take this into account, meaning that even a transaction equal to $1 could have large fees based on a large amount of data attached to the transaction, whereas a transaction equal to $1,000 could have a smaller fee if the amount of data attached to it is limited.Users have criticized some estimators as telling them to pay higher fees than necessary, but that’s partly because fees are so difficult to predict. Fees can fluctuate for all sorts of reasons. The day of the week, for instance, can be a factor since people generally make fewer transactions on the weekend, meaning transaction backlogs would ease and fees wouldn’t need to be so high during that time.In this way, users who don’t need to send money right away always have the option to wait for transaction backlogs to die down.Beyond that, there are more roundabout ways to eliminate transaction fees completely, but these are highly dependent on what wallet or exchange provider is used.For instance, it’s possible to transfer bitcoin on Coinbase for free, using its off-chain way of transacting or by moving funds to the startup’s cryptocurrency exchange, GDAX.While the idea of batching a bunch of smaller transactions into one big transaction has been used in the traditional payments space for some time, it’s becoming more popular for bitcoin businesses that facilitate payments.If more companies use this feature effectively, bitcoin transaction fees could be reduced by as much as 80 percent, according to one estimate. However, it’s worth mentioning that batching can erode privacy and is potentially slower, depending on how the company or user implements it.Despite these tradeoffs, though, several companies, including Coinbase, have announced they intend to implement batching to tame fees.In an effort to keep up with all the industry’s progress on decreasing fees, Bitrefill’s Kotliar launched a tool that allows users to see how optimized their bitcoin transactions are, displaying whether the transaction used batches, SegWit or a handful of other mechanisms shown to increase or decrease fees.“Just paste a transaction ID and see if you’re overpaying for your bitcoin transactions and withdrawals,” Kotliar tweeted.Plus, looking even further into the future, bitcoin developers are working on a handful of projects, such as the Lightning Network, that would be instrumental in reducing transaction fees, even as the number of people using the network continues to grow.Summing up the work in the industry to reduce transaction fees in the short term, BitGo engineer Mark Erhardt tweeted:“There is a lot of throughput to be gained by making better use of the available capacity.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo, Blockchain, Coinbase and Ledger. Fee charge statement image via Shutterstock"

sidechains allow developers to attach new features to a separate chain. 
Since ...","Jan 17, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","You’ve heard of proof of work, but what about proofs of proofs of work?","A complex notion, the research on “Non-Interactive Proofs of Proofs of Work,” or NiPoPoW, released in October, has received very little attention so far but is heralded as breaking through one of the major roadblocks that has stalled the widely anticipated sidechain technology.In the paper, researchers from IOHK, IC3 and the University of Athens describe a mechanism for proving that data exists in the bitcoin blockchain in a more efficient way.Though the idea can be useful in more than one context, it’s perhaps most exciting in the way the researchers describe the proofs’ benefits for sidechains, a technology that pegs other blockchains to bitcoin, which some, because of its obstacles, have called vaporware, but that others refer to as the “altcoin killer.”
Sidechains seek to solve a vexing problem – that adding features to bitcoin is a dangerous process since $230 billion of value is at risk if the new feature doesn’t work or malfunctions in practice.Instead of adding new features directly to the bitcoin blockchain, sidechains allow developers to attach new features to a separate chain. Since the chains are still attached to the bitcoin blockchain, the features can take advantage of the cryptocurrency’s network effects and test those applications, without harming the main network should vulnerabilities arise.Because of this, sidechains were met with excitement initially, but has faced contention since many have concerns about the security of the technology.Even still, some engineers have been grinding away at a parallel version of the technology that tries to rely on better economic incentives to make sidechains more secure, yet some developers remain skeptical they’re ready to add to the bitcoin network.But skeptics see this NiPoPoW research as a big step.Blockstream’s Mark Friedenbach, who co-authored the original sidechains white paper, first proposed in 2014, told CoinDesk:“This moves the ball down the field significantly.”The paper helps move forward the idea of trustless sidechains, over the more centralized type of sidechains – where the movement of funds of a federated sidechain is governed by a few companies – used today.While a simple idea, trustless sidechains are hard to put into practice.They rely on a technology called SPV (simplified payment verification) proofs, which work like this: in order to send money to a sidechain and back to the main bitcoin network again, users need to attach a proof that they really have the funds. Without these proofs, when users or miners move their money back to the main chain, under certain conditions, they could take more money than they really have.These proofs need to do two things before the technology can be added to bitcoin: one, prevent this sort of theft, and two, be small enough that they can actually be sent over the network.While so-called “compact SPV proofs” have been proposed, they’ve proved vulnerable to certain attacks, ones that would potentially allow miners to steal money left on the sidechains.Yet, the proof outlined in the NiPoPoW paper claims to be resistant to these attacks.“It’s the first protocol, to my knowledge, which makes [sidechains] secure at all,” University of Athens cryptography Ph.D. candidate Dionysis Zindros, one of the co-authors of the paper, told CoinDesk.He went on to explain that by “secure” he really means resistance to double spending, where users or miners could spend their coins more than once.“It’s really a missing piece in sidechain constructions that we fill in,” Zindros said.Friedenbach described the change in more technical terms: “This is a big step towards defining a block header commitment structure that allows for log-sized chain proofs, of the sort that one might use in a decentralized sidechains implementation.”While Friedenbach calls NiPoPoW “good research,” he added, work remains before the technology can be deployed on bitcoin.This is a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency world, where developers are careful about making changes to the still young and novel code. And while sidechains look to make the process of trying out new features easier and less nerve-wracking, implementing even that will take further deliberation.For one, to make sidechains more secure, many developers believe merge-mining – when miners mine multiple coins at the same time – would be essential.“There is still significant scripting capabilities that would be required before merge-mined SPV-proof sidechains could be supported on bitcoin mainnet,” Friedenbach said.But there are other worries around merge-mining that are more paramount.“There is also, of course, the non-trivial incentive problem of merged-mining and whether such a solution would be a step back in security, given the current state of the oligarchical mining industry,” Friedenbach added.In many’s view, since the industry relies on the work of a few large mining pools, it could be possible for these miners to have significant control over sidechains, and it’s not yet clear whether mining pools would have the power to steal funds.That said, this piece of the puzzle is exciting to Friedenbach, even though buzz around the paper has been subdued.He concluded:“This idea deserves more attention.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream. Light bulb image via Shutterstock"

No industry will avoid disruption, whether healthcare, government, finance or retail.Yet this may be, to quote the author Antonio Garcia Martinez:“The monumental hubris of assuming that the cure for our social ills lies in some as-yet uninvented future, rather than some forgotten past.”There is much that we can learn from history  –  as much as we can discover through new technologies.That’s why I delved into Marxism to understand more about what bitcoin is really about.I sat down and read Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper on bitcoin last month, and I must say that my mind was truly blown. It is a remarkable work.Yet I had several unanswered questions:As I reflected on these questions, I arrived at an insight that I believe applies to both Satoshi and Marx:“Genius is creative, but not predictive.”That is, both Marx and Satoshi articulated a reasoned, well-thought-out vision of the future. But neither had the power to predict how their ideas would influence others or be implemented. And neither could control their own creations.Marx’s ideas on communism and economics were influenced by his environment. It was that same environment that affected the propagation of his ideas – a fear of industrialization ;  that new technology would render laborers useless.That’s ironic, because it also describes our current environment, with the rise of artificial intelligence.The term “Luddite” refers to an actual group of the time that was against new technology. These changes, and the huge inequalities between the industrialists and the workers, prompted Marx to criticize capitalism heavily and propose a communal system instead.Bitcoin is also a product of its environment. The Satoshi white paper was first published in 2008, shortly after the 2007 recession. That event caused an erosion of public trust in financial institutions that, to this day, is still in disrepair. Thus, the idea to bypass institutions was born.Marx and Satoshi approached their respective problems in a somewhat similar way. Marx advocated for a stateless system, where the worker controlled the means of production. Private property would be abandoned for the notion of communal property, and the state would “wither away,” in the phrasing of Marx’s frequent co-author Friedrich Engels.Obviously, this withering did not happen in the countries where communists took over the state – the opposite happened, with horrific results.Satoshi sought to remove financial intermediaries  –  the banks and credit card companies that controlled the world’s flow of value. Instead, a peer-to-peer network would be established, with no central authority. The network would be carefully crafted so that no single actor could influence transactions wrongfully.As brilliant as the idea for bitcoin may be, its reality today is inarguably different from what Satoshi envisioned. In the white paper, bitcoin is described as follows:“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”While this is not necessarily wrong, this is not how bitcoin is primarily used today.Satoshi failed to predict bitcoin’s difficulty scaling to billions of transactions. The fees for buying and selling bitcoin, as well as the inability of the network to quickly process transactions, have changed its very nature. It is now used less as a payment method, and more as a store of digital wealth.Bitcoin’s main use cases today are as a speculative instrument (many traders are enticed by the large price swings) and as a “digital gold.” That’s not how Satoshi originally envisioned its adoption.Marx, as noted above, similarly failed to anticipate how his own ideology could be used to manipulate and exploit populations. The idea of a stateless economy became, in practice, totalitarianism. Populists who claimed to have the workers’ best interests at heart would succumb to the temptation of power.Yet, both bitcoin and Marxist thought continue to live on, in adapted forms.Marxism influenced several labor movements in the United States, and Marx’s critiques of capitalism are still echoed by both economists and grassroots movements. Further, several nations have adopted social democracies promoting a more communal form of capitalism.As for bitcoin, its future is playing out in front of us now. It may not be the final solution (a phrase with its own historical baggage) for peer-to-peer payments. But as a digital commodity, it has revolutionized the way people store wealth.Marx and Satoshi were both great minds, and their creations will continue to influence coming generations. That does not mean that they knew or could control how those ideas would spawn to life. We can honor their gifts, while acknowledging that they do not have the full, perfect answer.Karl Marx on East German banknote image via Shutterstock"

In addition to traditional payment systems, the patent filing lists bitcoin as a possible currency to pay with.The filing outlines a system of lockers where a party trading or selling an item can leave it in the locker for a buyer to pick up at their convenience. Some of these lockers may be configured to accept payments if the parties are renting the locker.The filing outlines different methods by renters can pay for the locker, specifically stating:“In example embodiments, the locker bank may include a point-of-sale (POS) system for accepting payment from users in the form of: (1) a cash transaction; (2) a credit or debit card transaction; (3) a gift certificate; (4) an electronic payment, such as payment by Google Pay, Apple Pay, PayPal, Bitcoin; and/or (5) any other suitable type of payment.”The patent application mentions bitcoin again later, as a way to refund customers, among more traditional payment methods like credit.The filing is the latest example of a patent application that lists bitcoin as a possible payment method.

In December, The Investor – another South Korean news outlet – reported that Samsung had partnered with a Russian bitcoin mining company called Baikal to produce ASICs, the production of which was also set to commence in January.Samsung’s shift toward manufacturing processors for the crypto mining industry marks an expansion of its existing chip products, which reportedly accounted for more than 60 percent of its 2017 operating revenue.If confirmed, the company’s involvement in mining will offer serious competition to the existing industry leader, China-based Bitmain, which claims to hold over 70 percent of the market share.Users on Twitter were quick to point out that the sheer size of Samsung’s semiconductor plant would give the firm an automatic advantage.Samsung image via Shutterstock"

He will also head upcoming programs to advance blockchain innovations.The blockchain industry has been evolving differently from the internet, stated co-founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, Bart Stephens. This difference, he said, has made possible for developers and engineers to stand at the forefront of innovation.With Song’s addition to the firm, Stephens continued:“Jimmy has demonstrated a deep commitment to the crypto development community. These ‘unsung heroes’ push the innovation envelope and bring to market much of the technology and services that comprise the blockchain and crypto industry today.”Aside from his bitcoin development work, Song has served as a principal architect at blockchain firm Paxos, as well as vice president of engineering at open-source wallet management platform Armory Technologies.At present, Song also runs a training company called Programming Blockchain, that provides blockchain programming and development training. He is also the author of “Bitcoin Tech Talk,” a cryptocurrency-focused blog.With his new role, Song stated that his passion for cryptocurrency industry grew two years after bitcoin was founded in 2009.“At that time, the community was relatively small and comprised of a core group of developers willing to volunteer their time and intellectual capital for the good of the industry.

for a ...","Jan 20, 2018 at 12:20 UTC","Frances Coppola spent many years working in banks and IT, and now writes and speaks about finance, banking and economics.","Bitcoin has proven incapable of accommodating growing demand without deviating considerably from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision of a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system.”It was intended to provide a fast, secure and inexpensive means of making payments without using the traditional financial system. Today it still only manages a tiny proportion of the traffic of, say, Visa or Mastercard, yet has become cripplingly slow and very expensive.Solving bitcoin’s scaling problem has become a principal concern of developers. But the problem has proved intractable.Now, making a virtue out of necessity, the buzz is that bitcoin is “digital gold.” Its built-in limit of 21 million bitcoins makes it an ideal anchor for a hard-money financial system similar to a strict gold standard. A new payment system could be built on top of it.The problem is, it isn’t possible to have full decentralization, a fixed money supply and sufficient liquidity for an efficient payments system. This is bitcoin’s “trilemma.”In the gold standards of old, there was no trilemma. They were always centralized.For example, the “classical” gold standard of the 19th century was the heyday of the British Empire, which at that time covered a third of the globe. The pound was the currency of international trade, and it was backed by gold.Countries in the empire were forced on to the gold standard by the British government; countries outside the empire joined the gold standard, or even adopted the pound as their currency, because it made trade much easier.In the center of the web, the Bank of England managed both the price of gold and pound issuance. It was the most centralized financial system since the Roman Empire.But for bitcoin, the fact that it is designed as a decentralized system means something else has to give. And the clue is its rapidly rising price.Bitcoin is becoming illiquid.Bitcoin’s growing illiquidity is due to a toxic combination of high demand, hoarding and designed-in scarcity. The rapid price rise indicates that purchases have increased much more than sales. More and more people are buying bitcoin in the hopes of cashing in as the price rises, while those who already own bitcoins are Holding On for Dear Life for the same reason.People are also reluctant to spend their bitcoins, because that rapidly rising price means that they face huge opportunity costs.And although bitcoins are still being mined, the rate at which they are mined is nowhere near enough to meet demand – and anyway, miners too can HODL their bitcoins.Meanwhile, rising transaction volumes are causing network congestion. Bitcoin has no means of adjusting capacity other than rationing verification. Miners verify transactions with higher fees more quickly than those with lower fees. Those who want fast verification (which is nearly everyone, since bitcoin’s price is rising so fast) will pay higher fees. Those who don’t want to pay higher fees must wait longer for their transactions to settle.Bitcoin’s popularity therefore means both higher transaction fees and slower settlement times. The design feature intended to prevent it coming to a hyperinflationary end is driving it towards deflationary gridlock. As Business Insider asked, what on earth is the point of money that you can’t spend and can’t convert to anything else?But is there a way round this problem? The clever folks working on the Lightning Network think so. Their solution is to take most transactions off-chain, and to share liquidity across the network.Lightning is a decentralized network of pre-funded, bilateral bitcoin payment channels off the bitcoin blockchain. Lightning transactions are typically small, and most are not broadcast to the blockchain. So they should be much faster and cheaper than on-chain bitcoin transactions.Assuming enough people open Lightning payment channels, there will eventually be a sizable bitcoin liquidity pool distributed across the network. The question is, how to enable it to be shared.Lightning developers are designing a routing facility that identifies which network nodes have sufficient funds to make a payment, calculates the shortest viable route to the payment destination across those nodes, and sends the payment. If this works, it would resolve the bitcoin trilemma.But it is not certain that it will work. There are two potential problems.The first is that Lightning’s pre-funded channels tie up funds that could be used for other purposes. Because of this, people may choose to keep very low balances in their Lightning channels, topping them up frequently rather than making infrequent balance adjustments.And the second is that channel funding changes constantly. Typically, people would fund their channel, then pay the balance down gradually. Soon after funding, there could be quite a large balance, but only a few days later, the balance might have diminished considerably.If a lot of people fund their channels at around the same time – for example, if people fund their channels on payday, then pay them down over the next month – liquidity across the network could vary considerably. This would mean that, at times, particularly for larger payments, it could be difficult or even impossible to find a payment route.As it stands, therefore, Lightning could prove as illiquid as bitcoin.Lightning’s illiquidity problem could be solved by creating large payment channels kept open and fully funded at all times, so that they were always available for payment routing. But this would mean Lightning was not fully decentralized.Such “hub” channels would be more efficient for payments, but they would be a magnet for thieves and a point of weakness in the network. If one went down, an awful lot of payments could be disrupted.The alternative would be to allow channels temporarily to go into deficit as a payment passes through. This would ensure that payments always settled.But since it is effectively fractional reserve lending, it would breach the “gold standard” principle of bitcoin. If gold is needed to settle payments, and you haven’t got enough gold, you can’t settle payments. That’s how a gold standard works. It is also why it fails.Lightning is still a work in progress, of course. But at present, it is hard to see how it can resolve bitcoin’s three-pronged problem.Neptune and trident image via Shutterstock"

As reported yesterday, notable finance figures including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein have already weighed in on the topic, suggesting that cryptocurrencies are quietly emerging as a major area of discussion at the gathering of the global elite.For example, Steven Mnuchin, who leads the U.S. Treasury Department, remarked on one panel that “illicit use” of cryptocurrencies is a major concern for American regulators.“My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they’re not used for illicit activities,” Mnuchin remarked, according to a report from Reuters.Similarly, fellow panelist and International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said bitcoin’s anonymity enables the movement of hidden funds.“The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism, is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements,” Lagarde, a former finance minister of France, was quoted as saying.Lagarde predicted that national governments are likely to further regulate cryptocurrencies to prevent these use cases. Perhaps proving Largarde’s point, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May told Bloomberg that cryptocurrencies should be looked at due to how they are used “particularly by criminals.”Perhaps most significantly, French President Emmanuel Macron called for an international approach to regulating cryptocurrencies, saying “we need to establish a global contract for global investment.”Others at Davos commented specifically on the exact economic impact of cryptocurrencies today, with comments drawn from finance watchdogs from Asia and Europe, among other areas.China’s securities regulator vice-chairman, Fang Xinghai, said during a panel that it is unclear what impact bitcoin would have on the economy.Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz echoed those remarks, adding that he believes there would be little impact on the economy if the cryptocurrency market were to crash.He went on to caution against investing in cryptocurrencies, saying:“When we had the tech wreck, that was a much more widespread exposure. And the fact it barely had [a] perceptible effect on the real economy because it was not a stock market crash but just a segment of the stock market. But it was highly speculative, there was all kinds of bubbles there.”The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, argued in turn that bitcoin has the potential to grow to a point where it would have a more significant impact.He called for further regulations “before the amount of outstanding bitcoin becomes large enough to be systemically important to in the global economy,” predicting that it would reach that point “soon.”Despite their concerns about cryptocurrencies, world leaders and regulators at Davos remarked positively about blockchain as a technology.Poloz, for example, called it “a true piece of genius,” adding that he expects it to be applied to different aspects of the economy.“The reason that it has such appeal in the case of bitcoin is it gives you finality of settlement that eventually grinds through the distributed ledger and therefore you trust that,” he remarked, according to CNBC, on the topic of a central bank-issued digital currency. “Whereas the central bank, if the Bank of Canada, were to issue a digital currency, well you already trust the Canadian dollar, and so you don’t need a distributed ledger in order to believe you just received final payment in your digital wallet.”Lagarde called the technology “fascinating,” noting its censorship-resistant characteristics, among others.She also suggested that other innovations are likely to emerge from the blockchain space, cautioning that regulators will need to monitor such developments over time, saying during the panel:“…there will be new things and innovations coming out of this movement, and we just need to keep them under our watch.”Image Credit: Drop of Light / Shutterstock.com"

Gox have brought a lawsuit against the company for the loss of 9,500 bitcoins – an amount worth around $133 million at today’s prices.","The case, first filed by Dr. Donald and his son Dr. Chris Raggio on March 5, 2014, was brought against a series of entities and individuals including Jed McCaleb and Mark Karpeles, the former owners of Mt. Gox. The defendants had filed a motion for summary judgment, but it was denied on Nov. 16, 2017. The two subsequently appealed the decision last month.According to the court document, Donald Raggio first registered on the Mt. Gox exchange around December 2010, at a time when bitcoin was trading at below $1, CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index shows.Yet email correspondence between Donald Raggio and McCaleb indicated that soon after, in January 2011, both became aware that someone moved the 9,500 bitcoins out of Donald’s account.While it was not clear how the account was accessed, McCaleb appears to have been involved in helping Raggio investigate the issue after he reported the loss. The court documents show that an investigation led to a potential suspect named “Baron,” who denied the accusation after his account was frozen.Then, in February 2011, McCaleb sold the Mt. Gox exchange to Karpeles, who later claimed that he inherited Mt. Gox’s assets, not its liabilities, from his predecessor.It wasn’t until after Mr. Gox declared its notable bankruptcy in 2014 that Donald and Chris Raggio brought the lawsuit against the firm.The defendants in the case have since argued that the case should be time-barred due to the statute of limitations in the Mississippi State, since it was filed three years and 54 days after the reported loss.Justice image via Shutterstock"

As of writing, Ripple (XRP), stellar lumens (STR) and cardano (ADA) are down at least 25 percent on the day each. Ethereum’s ether (ETH) token has shed 18 percent in value in the last 24 hours.So what’s troubling the cryptocurrency markets?Firstly, comments on social media indicate there is unease in the investor community over talk of a cryptocurrency trading ban in South Korea and further possible crackdowns on trading and mining in China.And secondly, BTC futures contracts are trading at a discount to bitcoin’s global average calculated by CoinMarketCap. The January expiry futures contract on the CBOE is trading at $11,510 and CME’s is changing hands at $11,530. Meanwhile, BTC spot is trading at $11,816. The discount (futures price lower than spot price) indicates that the market participants are bearish on the underlying asset (BTC).The technical chart analysis indicates scope for a drop to below $10,000 levels if the bulls can’t muster a response today.The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:Down button image via Shutterstock"

As previously reported by CoinDesk, these two features, combined with a third Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) called “Tail Call Execution Semantics,” would allow users to create private smart contracts on the bitcoin network.These private smart contracts would allow users to define their own criteria by which a payment would process, enabling multiple factors to be considered by the program. The smart contracts would then execute on their own.The combination of BIPs would also allow for these smart contracts to be stored in a compact manner on the actual bitcoin blockchain, meaning they would not take up a large amount of block space, or the amount of data that can be stored within each block of transactions.If developers and the broader bitcoin community approve of the change, it could be added to bitcoin by way of a soft fork.Telecommunication mast image via Shutterstock"

However, since Lightning is still at the testing stage, the company says use of the store is “at your own risk.”While still not ready for general use, the Lightning Network is one of the most-watched bitcoin-scaling solutions.Rather than changing bitcoin’s underlying code, Lightning effectively adds an extra layer to the network by which transactions would theoretically be made more cheaply and more quickly than directly on bitcoin’s blockchain.Last month, prepaid phone payment provider Bitrefill reportedly used Lightning to top up a cellphone.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.Coins image via Shutterstock"

Users can receive payment in the cryptocurrency as well as pay for rights, according to the company.The unveiling marks the first time Kodak has revealed its interest in the technology. The company is perhaps best known for its photography-related products, though a bankruptcy and subsequent recovery in 2013 led the firm to focus more actively on printing and digital film.Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said in a statement:“For many in the tech industry, ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem. Kodak has always sought to democratize photography and make licensing fair to artists. These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.”It’s not clear at this time how much Kodak intends to seek through the ICO, but the company said that the token sale – set for Jan. 31 – will be open to accredited investors from countries including the U.S. and Canada.“This initial Coin Offering is issued under SEC guidelines as a security token under Regulation 506 (c) as an exempt offering,” Kodak said.Market data suggests that, at the very least, Kodak is enjoying a bit of an investor windfall as a result of its announcement. As of press time, shares for Kodak are up roughly 37 percent for the day, having risen from an opening of $3.10 to as high as $5.50 before settling down around $4.30, according to Google data.Image Credit: Rizhka Nazar / Shutterstock.com"

Launched as a ministry-level agency, KCC is responsible for regulating the broadcasting and telecommunications sector, as well citizen’s information protection.Among the 10 surveyed companies, eight were found to be violating the Information and Communication Network Act, which mandates user privacy protection methods, according to the announcement.The eight penalized companies are: Upbit, Ripple4y, Coinpia, Youbit, Korbit, Coinone and Coinplug, as well as Eyalabs, a cryptocurrency wallet service. According to the agency, the individual fines range from $9,000 to $14,000.The announcement details that critical violations include some exchanges failing to delete users’ data even when they had stopped using the service for over a year, and some others storing users’ data outside of the country.KCC chairman Lee Hyo-Sung said:“While the security threats such as virtual currency speculation and hacking of handling sites are increasing, the actual situation of personal information protection of major virtual currency exchanges is very weak. Therefore, we will try to reduce the damage of users through more strict sanctions.”The KCC subsequently required these exchanges to take actions in resolving the issue within 30 days and file reports to the agency. In addition, the regulator said it will draw up and implement plans pertaining to managing cryptocurrency wallets, private keys and cryptocurrency transactions to serve as administrative guidance for exchanges.While the amount of the individual fines may not be significant, the move arrives just a day after the country’s financial watchdog set a date for the formal cessation of anonymous cryptocurrency trading, yet another signal of the effort underway by the country’s authorities to increase regulation of cryptocurrency exchanges.Editor’s note: Some statements in this article have been translated from Korean.Seoul image via Shutterstock"

The views expressed here are his own, so please don’t blame his colleagues.","The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.Did you hear the one about the crypto day trader who got struck by lightning? He’d read the weather forecast and heard the thunder, but scoffed and said “It’s all FUD.”The term FUD (“fear, uncertainty and doubt”) refers to the spreading of false or misleading information by the foes of a movement or organization, with the aim of undermining confidence in a project. It’s a close cousin to “gaslighting” and “concern trolling.” And it is, as the kids say, a thing.According to La Wik, the acronym dates back to the mid-70s and may have been coined by Gene Amdahl, a computer architect who quit IBM to start his own eponymous firm, only to have his former employer badmouth the new business.“FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products,” Amdahl reportedly said. Not cool, Big Blue, not cool. (Yeah, I know, most of the people working at IBM now weren’t born or were in diapers back then. But don’t get any smart ideas.)The term is popular in cryptocurrency circles, and for good reason. A lot of the critiques of bitcoin in the mainstream media over the years certainly smack of FUD. Setbacks such as a sharp price correction or a government writing burdensome regulations are often exaggerated as fatal blows.Hey, pajama boy, it’s a global, decentralized network. When the IRS issues a ruling that Americans have to pay capital gains taxes every time they buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin, that’s a nuisance, a First World Problem – not “the end for bitcoin.” The Venezuelans using bitcoin to survive aren’t going to care.I’d chalk it up to ignorance if these way-premature obituaries for bitcoin weren’t so sneeringly gleeful in tone.That said, setbacks do happen, and simply reporting incremental bad news or long-term challenges is not spreading FUD.“Thunderstorms expected today” is the weatherman’s way of helping us avoid getting drenched or electrocuted; it’s not a fiendish plot to trick us into spending the rest of our lives indoors.Yet if you read crypto Twitter, Reddit discussions or some of the comment threads on CoinDesk, you’ll see there’s a noisy contingent out there who view the world through a lens of bad faith and seldom bother to read an article past the headline.You’re reporting that the coin I invested in just dropped in price? FUD! You must be long a competing digital asset, and trying to tank the price of mine. That’s the only possible explanation.The government thinks crypto is being used by terrorists? FUD! Who cares what the government thinks? It’s not like they have guns and can seize a business’ servers or throw people in jail or anything. Oh, you’re “warning” they could do something? Well, it’s just obvious you think they should. “There’s a car coming”? FUD! You just don’t want me to cross to the other side of the road. That “don’t walk” sign flashing red is FUD too. So are all those horns honking…I will cop to being biased.I’ve stuck my neck out many a time to argue that cryptocurrency is, all things considered, good for the world. I left one of the oldest publications in the U.S. after 17 years to join CoinDesk. And yes, I HODL a small amount of crypto, mainly bitcoin. I believe this space has a bright future.But I also know there are going to be bumps along the way. Or, rather, New York-sized potholes, the kind that can wreck your front tire. Keeping a spare in the trunk is not falling for FUD, it’s prudent risk management.Volatility, scaling difficulties and hostile governments are all real. They can’t destroy a truly decentralized network like bitcoin, but they can slow adoption, stymie innovation and make life miserable for individuals.To simply note that these problems exist or that they are hard to solve does not imply they are insurmountable. And ignoring them won’t make them go away. Ask an ostrich.Bitcoin is often aptly compared to the red pill in “The Matrix.” But it seems these days that a lot of people pinning their hopes on short-term price gains in their cryptocurrency of choice just want to take a new kind of blue pill. Good luck with that.Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” via Wikimedia Commons"

transactions to the Internet of Things in a range of prototypes. But, like 
others ...","Jan 29, 2018 at 09:02 UTC",How will the Lightning Network change bitcoin?,"Although it might be too soon to know, it’s a question everyone’s seemingly asking following tests that take the long-anticipated tech closer to launch. The network’s garnered its fair share of excitement over the past few months, so much so that individuals and businesses are looking to take advantage of its cheap, fast payments.Out of this comes a small Japanese startup called Nayuta, which has been experimenting with adding Lightning payments to the Internet of Things, where everything from door locks to BMWs are connected to the internet to increase efficiency.With this experimentation, Nayuta is exploring a couple of implications of the tech.First, the startup believes Lightning could bring value to the Internet of Things in a way that old payment systems and bitcoin couldn’t because they’re both simply too slow.Second, it’s one of the first earnest businesses working on a product built on Lightning, showing that the off-chain network might actually have a business proposition, even this early on.Nayuta started off in 2015 by adding normal bitcoin transactions to the Internet of Things in a range of prototypes.But, like others using bitcoin, they were disappointed by its limitations. They found instant “zero-confirmation” transactions weren’t secure enough and that 10 minutes was too long to wait for a transaction to be secure.Then Lightning came along, the idea being it’s possible to actually make more secure instant payments (though there are still some caveats). Since it’s faster than traditional payments, Nayuta decided it was the “only” solution to Internet of Thing’s desire for payments that are as fast as the internet connections that fuel them.One recently popular Internet of Things product is the so-called “SmartLock.” Rather than requiring the metal keys we’re all used to (just one more thing to remember), the rightful owner can use their smartphone to unlock it.Showing the company’s switch in gears toward Lightning, they released a proof of concept of such a lock that opens only once it’s sent a Lightning payment.Neither of these things are particularly useful, at least in the current form (why would anyone want to require a payment to unlock something?). But, as Nayuta sees it, these proof-of-concepts demonstrate how real-time payments can for Internet of Things more broadly, one of millions examples being a sensor gathering data about an ocean, and a researcher directly paying the sensor a small fee over the Internet to get that information.The test payment was made between Nayuta’s homegrown Lightning software implementation, dubbed “Thunderbird”, and c-Lightning, an software implementation by bitcoin infrastructure startup Blockstream.In that way, not only does Nayuta “open the door” to interesting Lightning use cases, it also diversifies the number of Lightning software implementations there are, which the company thinks is important, because, it believes, some features are missing from current Lightning implementations.“We do not think Lightning is ready,” Nayuta CEO Kenichi Kurimoto told CoinDesk.All this feeds into the second interesting thing Nayuta is doing: It’s one of the first companies to build a business around Lightning, showing that perhaps Lightning has a business proposition.The handful of Lightning startups out there so far, such as Lightning Labs and Paris-based ACINQ are focused on the low-level technology, not building a product that their company around a particular application of Lightning.Though, Kurimoto admitted they’re not really being sure what to make out of all the prototypes they’ve launched over the last few years.“We did not decide the product future. Currently we’re concentrating on development of the [Lightning Network] software,” Kurimoto said, adding that one company that they can’t disclose due to NDAA using their software so far.Even so, Nayuta sees business promise in this area. Internet of Things payments have been floated for a long time, with even the likes giant payment processor Visa launching payment solutions in this area.But, to Kurimoto, the current financial infrastructure is behind the times.If refrigerators want to pay grocery stores and users want to use micropayments to pay for video and so forth, payments often need to be really small and fast. The current financial infrastructure wouldn’t be able to handle it.Kurimoto said:“The Lightning Network is the only solution for real-time transactions.”Matchheads via Shutterstock"

BitConnect once offered a referral program, and numerous accounts relate how supporters solicited friends and family to invest as well.Indeed, some of the ire has also been directed at YouTube posters who advocated for BitConnect, with some of those being accused of removing positive videos in light of the platform closures.An email from CoinDesk to the BitConnect team was not returned by press time.CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing situation.Image via Shutterstock"

The FSC said in the release that the new rule is resulted from an inspection of domestic anonymous crypto trading accounts – assisted by six domestic banks, as well as the Financial Intelligence Unit – from Jan. 8–16.In addition, the official announcement also established an anti-money laundering guideline for cryptocurrency exchanges, which outlines situations where exchanges should stay alert to potential illegal activity.The statement said:“Specifically, for users to make virtual currency transactions more than 10 million won per day or more than 20 million won for 7 days when depositing and withdrawing funds, this is the type of financial transaction you suspect for money laundering.”The new rule also appears to have a wider affect on foreign nationals who had been using cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea through a virtual bank account. As the FSC’s announcement pointed out, minors and non-citizens will be restricted from the new name verification service.So far, three major cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea have said they are in line with the new mandate.In an email response to CoinDesk, a representative from Coinone confirmed that it will enforce the change starting from Jan. 30. “Under the new requirement, six banks are preparing the real-name account linkage with exchanges. They are NongHyup, KookMin, Shinhan, KEBHana, IBK, and JB Bank. As for Coinone, our users have to be registered with NongHyup for the time being,” the company said.In addition, in its official blog post, Korbit also said on Jan. 19 that the existing fund deposit method will be terminated and replaced this month. It added that users “must have a Shinhan Bank account registered under your legal name.”According to a report from South Korean news agency Yonhap, the Bithumb exchange also said it will also enforce the new change as per the government’s requirement.Editor’s note: some content of the announcement had been translated from Korean.South Korean won via Shutterstock"

The botnet is based on the Windows exploit EternalBlue, which was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency and leaked by the Shadow Brokers hacker group last year. Eternal Blue was subsequently deployed in conjunction with another NSA-developed exploit, DoublePulsar, in the WannaCry attack.Windows servers have been the botnet’s primary victims, which ZDNet notes are ideal hosts because they are always turned on and have more processing capacity than a personal computer. The majority of affected machines are reportedly located in Russia, India and Taiwan, though the attack spans the globe.Attempts to curtail the botnet have had only short-term success thus far.  Cybersecurity workers from Proofpoint, abuse.ch and the ShadowServer Foundation attempted to eradicate the botnet using a technique called “sinkholing,” but the Smominru quickly recovered.As CoinDesk has previously reported, monero has increasingly been implicated with cybercrime, likely because transactions, the coins used in transactions and transaction histories associated with monero are all private.Last year, the previously mentioned exploit, DoublePulsar, was used to facilitate the secret installation of monero mining malware. Likewise,  earlier this week, security firm TrendMicro announced its discovery that miners have been appropriating Google’s DoubleClick ad services to distribute malware to mine the cryptocurrency."

(and ...","Feb 1, 2018 at 13:05 UTC",Marc Hochstein is the managing editor of CoinDesk and a former editor in chief of American Banker. ,"The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.Each of these three stories out of Asia is significant on its own, but when you read them side by side they tell a much bigger, global story.First, on Jan. 23 South Korea’s financial regulator set a date for the introduction of a new rule barring anonymous cryptocurrency trading accounts. (Or, as some sensitive snowflakes out there prefer we’d put it, “requiring customer identification for crypto trading accounts” – we never imagined anyone in this space would want to sugarcoat unwelcome news with euphemisms, yet here we are. But I digress…)The very next day, a different South Korean agency fined several cryptocurrency exchanges for failing to secure customer data. “While the security threats such as virtual currency speculation and hacking of handling sites are increasing, the actual situation of personal information protection of major virtual currency exchanges is very weak,” warned the chairman of the Korea Communications Commission in announcing the fines.Topping it all off, on Jan. 26, Coincheck, a crypto exchange in Japan, admitted it had been hacked in what appears to be the largest single theft in cryptocurrency history. Some $533 million-worth of a mid-tier crypto known as XEM were pilfered.So let’s step back here. Taken together, these events remind us that:Experienced crypto users will tell you that the answer to No. 3 is to keep most of your coins in cold storage and use the exchanges only for assets you’re actively trading. But the first two observations present a much knottier problem.In short, the juxtaposition lays bare the fundamental tension between compliance with anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer laws, on the one hand, and data privacy on the other.There are a number of ways to potentially resolve this conflict:Revisit AML laws. Ha. Fat chance.Not that these don’t deserve greater scrutiny. Libertarian early adopters of bitcoin may overstate their case (and invite ridicule from smug, soy-eating bluechecks) when they declare “money laundering is not a crime.” A better way to put it is this: It stands to reason that covering up a crime is itself a crime, but should it be a crime to obscure activity that is not itself illegal or harmful, simply because doing so inconveniences law enforcement?Some would say the answer is yes. There is a lot of nasty activity going on out there, even if you exclude victimless crimes (those involving only consenting adults). But the question needs to be asked of policymakers more than it has been. Still, don’t hold your breath for much in the way of change in a political climate shaped by 9/11, Charlie Hebdo, San Bernardino, etc.Exempt crypto businesses from AML laws. LOL, JK. See above.Require exchanges to tighten up cybersecurity. Say what you will about Benjamin Lawsky, but the former New York State regulator and architect of the BitLicense recognized the importance of diligent security practices for digital asset custodians. In fact, the strict cybersecurity standards he wrote for cryptocurrency firms in that controversial regulation were later imposed on traditional financial institutions on the NYS Department of Financial Services’ watch (over their objections).Granted, the BitLicense hasn’t exactly been a roaring success, with a grand total of four licenses granted since the regulation took effect in 2015 (unless you count the two trust charters given to applicants). Most startups in the crypto space have simply avoided doing business with Empire State residents or performed contortions to get around the regulations, viewed as onerous for a number of reasons. But the cybersecurity requirements aren’t usually cited among them.More to the point, though, this approach still amounts to saying “thou shalt collect and store nuclear waste – oh, and you better secure it, too.” More creative solutions might be in order.Thread the needle. In other words, find a way to satisfy the objective of fighting crime without making businesses hold all this data in the first place.For example, there is an adjacent ecosystem of digital identity startups and open-source projects aiming to create personal data vaults and reusable IDs. Although models vary, a common thread is that instead of giving the keys to your identity to every stranger you do business with, you could just present them with proof that you are entitled to access a given resource.For example, a bouncer at a club needs to know you’re old enough to drink, but not your exact birthday; similarly, if you can prove to a bitcoin exchange that you’re not on the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control’s sanctions list, maybe they wouldn’t need that copy of your passport.The big idea is that not everyone you trade with needs to know who you are as long as someone knows who you are. Law enforcement could still trace transactions through the blockchain, to an exchange, and ultimately to an identity provider that could identify the user under court order.Generally this concept, articulated in the 2014 Windhover Principles and elsewhere, sounds like an improvement on the status quo. But real-world applications have been rare.Also, you could argue that even if put into wider practice, these ID solutions might amount to a mere rearrangement of deck chairs, at best. If we no longer have lots of nuclear waste facilities, but instead have a few big nuclear waste facilities (with back doors for law enforcement to boot), won’t that make identity thieves’ job even easier?And finally, even if these ID providers are secure, who’s to say they’d insist on seeing a warrant before giving up your data to the government? The Snowden revelations showed how the odious “third-party doctrine,” which states that citizens have no reasonable expectation of privacy when they give information to a business, has undermined Fourth Amendment protections in the U.S. It’s hard to trust governments to respect constitutional limits on their power in this day and age, and Donald Trump occupying the Oval Office is really the least of it.One sincerely hopes that the development of decentralized exchange will eventually make the issue moot, at least as it relates to trading of digital assets. Until then, stay vigilant about protecting your money, your personal information, and your civil liberties.Chalkboard image via Shutterstock"

The acquisition comes on the heels of BitGo’s $43 million Series B funding round in December.Kingdom Trust, according to its website, serves over 100,000 clients, focusing on institutional-centered custody services as well as self-directed individual retirement accounts (IRAs).Speaking to CoinDesk, BitGo CEO Mike Belshe positioned the move as one geared toward a growing interest among institutional clients, with the problem of custody (and regulatory compliance) being at top of mind for some of those eyeing the market.“That wall of institutional money cannot hit until that custodianship is met, and this is the first custodian for U.S. folks,” he said. “Going forward, as a new type of investors in crypto comes along — which is asset managers and hedge funds — they don’t have the technical depth. They have other skills, and we want to bridge that.”While the business terms of the deal are complete, the sale is still awaiting regulatory approval.“All the commercial terms are done,” Belshe added.While the terms of the deal are not being disclosed at this time, the acquisition comes after the two companies had worked together for years. Previously, BitGo had provided cold storage for Kingdom Trust’s bitcoin, ethereum and other asset holdings, Belshe told CoinDesk. Indeed, both firms had previously partnered with BitcoinIRA to create products around the cryptocurrency.He also pointed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s move to explain its concerns with possible cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Belshe said the Kingdom Trust acquisition could possibly facilitate the creation of cryptocurrency ETFs given the focus on custody, he said.To further support this possibility, last month, BitGo added strategic investor and outspoken bitcoin ETF advocate Don Wilson as an advisor.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo.Bank vault image via Shutterstock"

To do so, it uses a “greedy algorithm” on the blockDAG to identify blocks mined by “honest” nodes, but not those from “non-cooperating” nodes that deviate from the mining protocol.The paper states:“Using this distinction, PHANTOM provides a full order on the blockDAG in a way that is eventually agreed upon by all honest nodes.”Solving the problem of linear ordering, the authors say, enables PHANTOM to scale any computation, including smart contracts.However, Sompolinsky and Zohar note that, by adopting linear ordering, the protocol sacrifices some of the speed of confirmation previously achieved by SPECTRE. The researchers indicated their plans to resolve this problem in future work.Bicycle chain image via Shutterstock"

But this is the best way to harden it,” one Twitter user wrote.Yet using the network while it’s still in development has not only led to confusion as to its readiness, but it’s also caused several people to lose real bitcoin funds. Because of that, Blockstream’s decision has been criticized, and others have called opening Lightning channels with hundreds and thousands of dollars of bitcoin “crazy.”In spite of persistent warnings, though, mainnet implementations of Lightning already have over 205 nodes and 548 channels, at press time, with no sign of stalling.Yet, what this momentum is slowing, according to developers, is the rate at which Lightning will be safe to use on the bitcoin mainnet.As Pierre-Marie Padiou, who develops Lightning at ACINQ, told CoinDesk:“Recently we have seen more and more users configuring their software for mainnet, some thinking that this will make Lightning Network deployment happen faster somehow.”But that’s just not the case.In a recent interview, CEO of Lightning Labs, Elizabeth Stark, approximated the developer count on the Lightning Network to be as low as ten individuals – a factor which as detailed by CoinDesk could be slowing down the release of the tech. Perhaps due to this shortage, Lightning Labs has appealed to users to stop sending money over the system, stating that, “It has become an unnecessary distraction for our devs.”“A lot of people want to get on mainnet and it’s hard to tell them that it’s not quite ready and that they should test on testnet,” said Alex Bosworth, a Lightning developer. “I wouldn’t recommend using mainnet unless you are explicitly testing and fully know what you are doing.”According to Bosworth, who runs two of his own mainnet nodes, one major problem Lightning developers could run into as they move to release a mainnet implementation is needing to be backwards-compatible, so that the upcoming release would interoperate with the current prototypes being developed.If the nascent mainnet continues to mature – it has doubled in node count in the past 72 hours – it could “reduce the speed of development,” as devs would “have to worry about keeping backwards compatibility with previous versions,” Bosworth said.Yet, even with all this in mind, there’s no sign active use will stop.“We plan on keeping our Lightning Network nodes up and running permanently to help support the network,” said TorGuard CEO Ben Van Pelt.And that aligns with Lightning adopter David R. Sterry’s defense of the active use of the in-development network, saying the criticism “isn’t unanimous,” and adding that developers “could have made it harder to do if [they were] really against it.”He continued, “There are some issues you’ll only find with real money.”And mainnet testing has led to the uncovering of several bugs.According to the International Business Times, Blockstream’s deployment of the tech led to the discovery of 20 bugs in the first 14 hours following its launch. And the CEO of TorGuard, Ben Van Pelt, told CoinDesk the company has encountered a few bugs along the way, but none that have caused the company or its users to lose money.In this same vein, CSO of Blockstream Samsom Mow tweeted: “Using Lightning Network on mainnet isn’t just bug fixing, stickers and being #reckless. It’s also learning about usability issues that we may not be considering.”But Padiou thinks this overlooks an important point, saying once the network is live, “Every bug encountered will potentially be orders of magnitude more costly in terms of development resources. That’s why on the way to a stable, working Lightning Network, rushing things will not make us actually go faster.”The active network “just puts more pressure and adds more distraction to the already small number of people actually doing the development,” he continued, adding:“Let’s not forget that [developers] are the scarcest resource of all.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream. Lightning over palm trees image via Shutterstock"

capitalization) increased from 41% to 66% – even as the overall market ...","Jan 8, 2018 at 06:30 UTC","Brendan Bernstein is a founding member of Tetras Capital Partners, LLC, an investment manager focused on investing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain assets.","The crypto market moves in cycles – and understanding these cycles is key to profiting, managing risk and keeping sane.Howard Marks describes two ways to profit from markets: (1) Hold more of the things that rise and less of the things that fall, and (2) cycle adjustment, or trying to have more risk exposure when markets rise and less when they fall.Most people ignore the second part. Yet the key to cycle adjustment is understanding where you are in the cycle and calibrating the risks and rewards to account for it.Similar to the broader economy, we have both short and long-term cycles. Short-term cycles are driven by the capital flows, investor composition and market sentiment. Long-term cycles result from the aggregate effects of the short-term cycles and ultimately are driven by long-term fundamentals.Over the last few months, the market has been driven by new capital entering the space and a psychological acceptance of bitcoin. The capital — both retail and institutional (i.e., new crypto hedge funds) — entered initially through the most liquid crypto assets and fiat currency onramps.Bitcoin, being the most liquid fiat onramp, has performed well. It was also the first asset many investors became comfortable with during that time.From July 1st to Dec. 10th, bitcoin dominance (or its percentage of total cryptocurrency market capitalization) increased from 41% to 66% – even as the overall market cap of all cryptocurrencies was increasing outside of bitcoin. BTC’s price increased from $2,492 to almost $20,000.I’ll stress that this was not driven by fundamentals, but rather the capital flows and accessibility premium of bitcoin. New capital had a bias for bitcoin because it was the easiest to understand, custody and purchase.The short-term cycle moved in BTC’s favor.Moving toward December, the market started to become more and more dominated by retail and – let’s be honest – less crypto-educated capital. Coinbase is a great proxy for this phenomenon. From June to October, Coinbase signups were relatively constant at  about30,000 per day.However, starting in early November, this number started to increase dramatically, exceeding 100,000 on some days.Initially, this capital continued to pour into bitcoin, putting fuel on the short-term cycle and building new investor sentiment in favor of BTC.BTC was going to $100,000, and by the time CNBC debuted its coveted “BTC Ticker,” the pendulum had swung too far in BTC’s direction.Larger investors started to take profits, bitcoin began to falter. It was time to find the next new shiny object…As capital moved out of bitcoin and into other assets, we saw the end of one short-term cycle and beginning of the next. Starting in early December, a new cycle began and the “cheaper” Coinbase assets stole the show.Capital that initially entered the crypto markets through BTC was finally comfortable with the crypto space and willing to move out on the risk curve. In other words, it was time to play with house money.The newer retail entrants cared less about fundamental protocol strength and were easily lured into a protocol’s marketing pitch. These were not cypherpunks.BTC is archaic and overpriced to these investors. There is no EEA of bitcoin. No marketing team is pushing it. Why buy a $17,000 digital gold when you could buy a $100, faster alternative? In the first three weeks of December alone, litecoin increased 3.7x from $100 to $371 while BTC continued to lose ground.LTC, too, would have a fall from grace when longer-term LTC holders began to sell (ahem Charlie) and returns started to stagnate. These restless investors moved on once again with more house money to play with. Their attention moved from the roulette table that is Coinbase to the craps table that is Bittrex, Poloniex and Binance. As a result, signups on those exchanges skyrocketed, and Bittrex even had to close new user accounts.“Holy shit, even cheaper versions of BTC.” Their marketing budgets lured them in with the siren call of lambos.It seems ridiculous to say, but the cheaper the asset, the greater the chance of a return. And when I said cheap, I’m not referring to a fundamental measure of value like a value investor would (P/BV, P/E, etc). I’m referring to its price.A chart of returns over the past seven days paints this picture. There’s a direct negative correlation between the price of the token and return. It’s scary, but it’s unfortunately true.TRX, XRP, XLM, ADA, you name it. “Bitcoin 3.0.” Faster, cheaper and more upside. Right? It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. BTC retreated 40% and overall dominance fell from 65% down to 37% this week. The fire was already smoldering.New retail investors were the gasoline. Preston Byrne said it best – cryptocurrencies have become the worlds largest penny stock casino.Investors trying to find fundamental value are ripping their eyes out. XRP, with legitimately zero fundamental usage (see below), just passed BTC in diluted market cap.Over the last day I’ve asked several people close to banks if banks are indeed planning to begin using Ripple’s token, XRP, in a serious way, which is what investors seem to assume when they buy in at the current XRP prices. This is a sampling of what I heard back: pic.twitter.com/zbfMqg4TpD— Nathaniel Popper (@nathanielpopper) January 5, 2018IOTA has proven cryptographic flaws. What the hell is TRON? RaiBlocks went from a market cap of $30 million to $4 billion in a week. What. The. Fuck.Meanwhile, assets with real usage, actual code and strong development communities, like monero for example, have not moved. Are investors supposed to recognize the reality of the situation that, for the current market regime, fundamental protocol strength — adoption, code quality, tech talent, etc. — means less than the price of the asset and marketing budget.Should you go all-in on coins less than $1? Or do you stick to your guns, find value and weather the shitcoin storm?The answer comes down to understanding where we are the cryptocurrency cycle.The answer to investing is rarely black and white. It’s not “get in” or “get out.” It’s usually somewhere in the middle.When people are increasingly willing to take risk and fear of missing out (FOMO) is prevailing over any sense of security and analytical discipline, that’s the time to be worried. When the fundamentally weakest assets are rallying the most and people are proclaiming BTC is dead, we’re starting to near the end of a short-term, altcoin-dominated cycle.The problem is that investors tend to think of themselves as analytical, disciplined and contrarian, but the fact of the matter is that most tend to magnify cyclical moves. They cannot stomach the possibility they may miss out on gains.That is why predicting the exact top and bottom is so challenging. But doing so with exact precision is not necessary…Does anyone still talk about Bitcoin?— Ran Neuner (@cryptomanran) January 5, 2018Howard Marks describes the strategy well:“No one can ascertain when we’re at the exact top or bottom, a key to successful investing lies in selling – or lightening up – when we’re closer to the top, and buying — or, hopefully, loading up — when we’re closer to the bottom.”Profiting from the short-term market cycles is not predicated on owning 0 bitcoin at peak alt and 0 alts at peak BTC. The key is that when investor euphoria is widespread, we should lighten up on those assets which are expensive and be more aggressive with those that are cheap. The time to be overweight alts is at the beginning and middle of the altcoin cycle. Not towards the end. And the same generally holds true for bitcoin.It’s about calibrating and balancing your allocation of capital in accordance with the current cycle and how aggressive or defensive you want to be.Meanwhile, amid the small-cap and altcoin euphoria, we’re on the precipice of a major entrance of institutional capital to the space and the one place it is going is BTC. Family offices, large hedge funds and endowments will not be investing in Bcash. A BTC ETF will launch sooner than people think. A TRON one will not.To profit from these cycles, you need to first understand where we stand in it and then be able to act counter to it at the peaks and troughs. It’s not easy. The only reason it’s profitable is that because it’s so hard. At first, you’re bound to lose money as the cycle continues in its march to irrationality. But the cycle will always turn, and in crypto, we know it won’t be long until it does.Those with large altcoin positions should be worried. When the cycle reaches its peak and begins to turn, smaller-cap, illiquid tokens will fall as fast as they’ve gone up. Liquidity will dry up fast and you will not be able to sell anywhere close to the quoted price.The market in altcoin terms is getting expensive and in BTC terms it’s getting cheaper. It’s time to start using altcoin gains to build up core, fundamentally strong positions.I’m not making this up. We’ve seen it happen before.This period is eerily similar to March 2017. “Bitcoin 2.0,” ethereum, had recently launched on Coinbase, the EEA was getting cemented and a slew of conferences were created to promote etheruem. Why invest in digital gold when you could own a world computer?For three months, ETH dramatically increased in price as new retail investors poured into the space and quit their jobs to day trade after massive gains. ETH increased in price from $7 in December of 2016 to $391 by June of 2017. BTC dominance fell from 86% to 40%. We were on the precipice of “the flippening,” after which many thought BTC would subsequently fall to zero.Until the music stopped. Investors were tapped out. ICOs slowed down and ETH started having scaling issues just as the price got ahead of itself. Institutional capital began to enter BTC. The BTC dominance cycle began to revert.Illiquid altcoins, some of the same ones the new retail investors have made their money from, fell dramatically. XVG fell from a peak of $0.006 down to $0.002, a 67% decline. XRP fell from $0.31 to $0.15, a 50% decline.This year isn’t the first time it’s happened. Investors have been lured out of bitcoin into altcoins since the first ones launched.Since 2013, we’ve been seeing BTC dominance fall, only to regain most of the lost ground shortly thereafter. This cycle, too, will revert.Each aforementioned BTC cycle has a common thread: The investor base, partially driven by new capital, becomes enamored by an alternative asset or market narrative.The cycle is usually triggered by a legitimate change in fundamentals. And then, subsequently, it’s taken to the extreme by investor behavior. Earlier in 2017, it was smart contract functionality and ICOs. Now, as BTC fees creep up and ETH is facing scaling issues, most of the coins that have increased in price are aiming to be cheaper, faster or more scalable.What we’re actually seeing is a mini-Gartner hype cycle play out around a new market theme or narrative.New technology captures investor attention. Emotional influences cause investors to follow the herd and fear of missing out predominates. The cycle gets taken to its extreme until it can go no further.At one Point in the 1989 Japanese real estate bubble, the Imperial Palace in Japan was said to be worth more than the entire state of California,, things that don’t make sense don’t last….be careful out there— Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) January 4, 2018It goes without saying, but the current market regime is not fundamentally driven whatsoever, but is instead driven by narrative and investor sentiment.The market is a Keynesian beauty contest. It’s crucial to practice second-level thinking— the question isn’t just why a protocol is interesting, but why and when the market will find it interesting.The most profitable trades come from synthesizing views on the macro liquidity cycle, narrative and capital flows with micro-analysis into the crypto-economic tradeoffs and qualities of each protocol.Towards the end of each short-term cycle, instead of doubling down on what’s been working — i.e. doubling down on altcoins right now — prepare for the turn of the next.When in a BTC cycle, the question to ask is: what narrative will be the crux of the next Gartner hype cycle? Where will the capital flow when the BTC cycle peaks, and what will be the catalyst?Fundamentally analyze each protocol and determine which will benefit most from a shift in narrative. Do your diligence. Make sure the code and underlying infrastructure is sound and protect your capital.When you inevitably find yourself thinking that BTC or [INSERT PROTOCOL HERE] can’t be stopped, remember that we’ve been evolutionarily programmed to think pro-cyclically. It will be stopped.

Kidd has previously invested in Coinbase, Square and Twitter.In a statement, the investor praised Uphold’s scalability, as well as its compliance practices.In addition to forming Uphold Labs, the investment will help fill Uphold’s loss assurance to roughly 20 percent of its crypto holdings, protecting its users from potential losses due to cryptocurrency volatility or other issues.Kidd told CoinDesk:“Because of the strength of Uphold’s compliance and controls, I’m willing to pledge a certain amount of my balance sheet, or the balance sheet of my venture company … as a reserve. That means that if there was some adverse effect at Uphold that might put it otherwise in a position of operating as a fractional reserve, this is like an insurance program that will make sure that user balances are protected.”A spokesperson for Uphold said the licensing revenue and development wing will receive 20 percent of the funding, which will be used to add more cryptocurrencies to increase the firm’s connectivity to financial systems, as well as for use in Ripple-related projects.Then, 45 percent will go to equity, and the remaining 35 percent will be shifted to its reserve balance sheet.The partnership will help Uphold provide “unprecedented asset protection,” said chief executive Adrian Steckel.Formerly called Bitreserve, before its rebrand in 2015, Uphold offers foreign exchange and international remittances in bitcoin and fiat currencies. It also provides e-commerce services.Michael Del Castillo contributed to this article.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Ripple. Dollar bills image via Shutterstock"

of ethereum tools and solutions was released; Quroum, Corda, and ...","Jan 22, 2018 at 08:00 UTC","Ajit Tripathi is an EMEA partner at Consensys Enterprise, and a former director of fintech and digital banking at PwC, where he co-founded its UK blockchain and smart contracts practice.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.I have come to trust Vitalik Buterin to ask the most important questions in blockchain.The ethereum founder did that again last month when he asked in a tweet: “Alright, the crypto market is now worth $525 billion, but how much of that valuation have we really earned?”We can answer Vitalik’s question by using the tried-and-true method of discounted cash flows.During the 1990s dot-com boom, valuation by counting eyeballs and various other body parts was rampant.During the housing boom, valuation was whatever you wanted by tuning projects’ default rates, prepayment rates, volatility and correlation.During the current crypto boom, methods rooted in science fiction such as network-based valuation, technical analysis, Metcalfe’s law and Moon-based valuation have all blossomed.Unfortunately, whenver bubbles burst, discounted cash flows return with a vengeance.So, while we all believe blockchain technology can solve all our problems including valuation problems, let’s pretend this time is not different, and one day either everyone in crypto will have to generate fiat revenues and profits in some form.The less likely that you will get the cash you think you will get in the future, the higher the discount rate. That is a big mess when you are dealing with anything except government bonds, which academic orthodoxy treats as risk-free (never mind the humongous national debt).Asset pricing gets even worse when commodities and currencies are involved and we have to start watching costs and benefits of HODLing all your digital GODL or any “implied interest rate” you might earn on your GODL. That forecast of net benefit to the HODLer is basically your cash flow forecast.So, as Vitalik pointed out – the crypto market is worth $525 billion but what did we do that is worth that in the future?The question is what did we solve, enhance, or deliver that will make individuals, companies or governments produce more, be more efficient, or enjoy their lives and relationships more?At a high level, we can ask:1. What features (e.g. Truffle), products (e.g. UPort) or platforms (e.g. Digital Trade Chain) did we build that a consumer is using or benefiting from? No, I don’t mean tether, Telegram chat channels, or proofs of concept.2. Which enterprise solutions went live and how much new revenue or efficiencies did they create? This includes the work ConsenSys and IBM are doing in Dubai, trade finance platforms by IBM and R3, MUFGCoin and so on.3. How much did we improve the infrastructure and stack by in terms of scalability, privacy, confidentiality and other such nice things? Quorum, zcash, Fabric, Corda, Coco – all count.4. What original business models and technologies were created in 2017? ERC-20 tokens and CryptoKitties are included. Stablecoin crypto exchanges are excluded.5. For each of these, what’re the odds that we will see the invention used by a real person or enterprise over time? In the absence of any information, let’s assume 50% for each.There is simply no way that we baked $500 billion worth of additional consumer value last year that we didn’t have in 2016 – and all we had in 2016 was PoCs and a few promising ideas.Any which way you make your list, there was just not enough useful kit in consumer or enterprise production last year.Bitcoin scraped through to Segwit and all sorts of forks. A very large set of ethereum tools and solutions was released; Quroum, Corda, and Fabric became useful in the enterprise ecosystem, and a very small number of consortia got into technical production.We bypassed VCs and made it possible for good, bad, and ugly blockchain startups alike to fund their runway.So how much value did we add in 2017? When we calculate the consumer value of ERC tokens and CryptoKitties, and subtract the future disasters from future Amazons, we will probably get a smaller number than the $3 billion that was raised last year in ICOs.Then we will thank Vitalik that all this money that could have gone into a largely useless coinware instead went into useful tech.Yes, there will be a lot more value created with blockchain in 2018 and even more the year after but there’s so much future baked into the prices today – and it may need to be swapped around as we learn more.I suspect that each year, half of the ICO-funded startups from the previous year will die – if they even make it that long.Yet there will be the next Amazon or Google or Netflix in there. If you know how to pick them, go ahead. I don’t.This is why I am making a big bet of time on ethereum rather than a bet of money in crypto.Ethereum has momentum, developer adoption, and a team that is willing to address the technical limitations even at risk to the price of ether.It has people who are serious about the Web 3.0 vision and solving real consumer and business problems.Does that mean $7, $70, or $700 billion is a fair value for ether? I can’t say. Whether ether will go to the moon in 2025 depends on if ethereum is still the public blockchain in widespread use or if someone comes up with something much better, and if ethereum continues to evolve unlike some other crypto networks have.Does that mean you should buy ether today? I can’t and don’t offer investment advice.Should you start learning how to use ethereum to build solutions and decentralized businesses? Definitely – my son is learning how to build with ethereum and he is 14. He can do quite well just knowing how to build solutions for other people.When we are dead, it’s not what we HODL or SODL that matters. It’s what we BUIDLSo I advise everyone to think about that and BUIDL. Those who BUIDL do seem to enjoy it and look happier than the rest of us.Besides, since BUIDLers don’t have the time to day trade or buy dodgy coins, they are also a lot less likely to get REKT.Workers image via Shutterstock"

The company intends for the ETF to track blockchain technology projects, mirroring its Harvest Blockchain Technologies Index.According to the Globe and Mail, two other Canadian companies, First Trust Portfolios Canada and Evolve Funds Group Inc., are also seeking to launch blockchain funds, and filed their first prospectuses with regulators this week.First Trust is already a presence in the U.S. market, offering its blockchain ETF under the ticker LEGR. The introduction in Canada of its First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF (ticker: BLCK), modeled after the Indxx Blockchain Index, is the product of client demand, the company said.“Every conversation we are having with clients – regardless if we are talking about a Canadian equities product or a U.S. equity product – inevitably leads to [a discussion about] blockchain or bitcoin,” Karl Cheong, head of ETFs for First Trust Portfolios Canada, told the Globe and Mail.Evolve Funds Inc. claims that its proposed blockchain ETF, known as LINK, would be the first “actively managed” available to Canadian investors. The product will position the company to “capitalize on emerging opportunities in the industry.”Its fund will invest in “equity securities of issuers that are involved in the research, development, or utilization of blockchain technologies, or involved in the supply chain for blockchain applications including technology hardware,” the company said in a statement.As previously reported by CoinDesk, the first blockchain ETFs to trade in the U.S. launched on Nasdaq and NYSE Arca last month.Image via Shutterstock "
60,www.coindesk.com,"Jan 18, 2018",3 (Possible) Reasons the Crypto Markets Tanked This Week,https://www.coindesk.com/three-possible-reasons-the-crypto-markets-tanked-this-week,"The two most popular cryptocurrencies (and the two largest by market cap), 
bitcoin and ethereum, dipped below the psychological price levels ...","Jan 18, 2018 at 00:00 UTC",$300 billion.,"Poof. Gone in 36 hours.This week’s cryptocurrency market crash erased paper fortunes and likely churned a few stomachs belonging to new investors who had been piling into the space.While the market has been in a frenzy over the past few months – with the majority of coins reaching all-time-highs while the market caps of cryptocurrencies with little technical development (Dogecoin) and niche business opportunity (Dentacoin) surged past $1 billion in network value – starting Tuesday morning, it began shedding weight.Lots and lots of it, in fact. Most of the major cryptocurrencies saw double-digit drops continuing until Wednesday. The two most popular cryptocurrencies (and the two largest by market cap), bitcoin and ethereum, dipped below the psychological price levels surpassed last year – $10,000 and $1,000, respectively.And XRP, the native cryptocurrency of enterprise blockchain startup Ripple Inc., lost nearly 50 percent of its value on Tuesday, after a month-long bull run that made the coin a retail investor darling and the apple of a startup’s eye.As always, crypto-enthusiasts took to social media to restate their HODL-ing patterns and declare that this, in fact, is a great time to buy.But others, who haven’t held on through the ups and downs of the last four-plus years, and might even have been some of the reason (i.e., panic selling) the markets tanked so hard, might be wondering what just happened.And as the markets begin to regain some of their position going into Wednesday night, it’s hard to pinpoint anything specific, but there’s a confluence of events surmised to have driven the couple days of red.By far, the most prevalent explanation is that harsh stances by governments in China and more recently, South Korea, led many investors to flee.China, for one, has caused the markets to drop in the past. For instance, when the People’s Bank of China banned payment companies from working with bitcoin exchanges in 2013, the market immediately dipped.And although there was some market clamor in September when China banned initial coin offerings (ICOs) and moved to shut down crypto exchanges in the country, the market for cryptocurrency trading has diversified significantly, and as such, the markets took far less time to recover.More recently, though, South Korea regulators have been hammering on the crypto industry all month, with banks facing scrutiny over crypto exchange relationships and investors facing fines for anonymous trading accounts, the latter of which was disclosed on Monday.Still, any news of strict regulation will “add pressure to the downside,” said Lanre Sarumi, CEO at risk management system providers Riskbone and the CEO of Leveltradingfield, which designed a game that allows people to place bets on the future price of bitcoin.And Michael Graham, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, an investment bank in New York, echoed that sentiment, saying that the regulatory rumblings have “helped people start to create more of a cautious narrative that’s sort of feeding on itself.”Secondly – and perhaps interesting in its counterintuitiveness – is that far more technical people are a part of the cryptocurrency markets now, and according to Sarumi, that demographic shift of sorts could be exacerbating the downturn.While the interest in cryptocurrencies by these sophisticated investors has been widely seen as a beneficial development, their use of complex market tools can have effects on the price that many in the crypto scene, especially novice retail investors, might not see as positive.For instance, more experienced investors “are putting their stop loss triggers at support levels,” Sarumi said.A stop loss is an order placed with a broker to sell an asset when it reaches a certain price. If a significant number of investors have stop losses around the same price, and if the price dips below that number, those sell orders are placed at once without demand on the other side. The sell-off could trigger others to panic sell, as they might think the market is crashing.Sarumi continued:“Once those levels are breached, the stop orders flood the market adding additional pressure to the downside.”Plus, the debut of bitcoin futures on Cboe and CME last month was also viewed with optimism, as a sign of the industry maturing, but the expiration of the futures contracts this week was a source of some trepidation.Because the futures product is so new, and the development of derivatives is key to the crypto markets’ maturation, some were “nervous about the first expiration,” Graham said. “If we can get through a few closings, it will give people confidence” in the crypto sector. (Earlier today, Cboe’s first bitcoin futures contract expired.)In this way, there isn’t yet a huge number of institutional investors jumping in that would keep the market more stable.The increased interest in cryptocurrencies has also put a strain on market infrastructure.“Pretty much all the companies in the space are facing the influx of new users … and it’s taken a toll on most companies,” said Nejc Kodric, CEO of Bitstamp, a crypto exchange which has been around since 2011.For one, several exchanges have stopped taking new users. Bitfinex, for example, temporarily curtailed account registrations in December “in a move designed to preserve the trading, support, and verification experiences of our existing, long-term user base,” the company said in a blog post last week. It said Friday it had resumed new account openings.And further, many users of the U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken were up in arms when a software upgrade, which was supposed to take two hours lasted nearly two days, halting trading for the same time period.While most understand the ecosystem is still new and, as such, prone to problems, when market infrastructure goes down, many people get worried.Adding further fuel to the fire, BitConnect announced it would close its lending and exchange platform, causing the company’s BCC token to crater and leaving holders at least temporarily unable to cash out.Speaking to investors’ instinct over recent days to sell or at least stay on the sidelines, Graham concluded:“Put all those together and it’s easy to create a narrative that ‘hey, the market’s kind of overheated and needs to take a break.'”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Kraken and Ripple. Banana peel and man’s foot image via Shutterstock"

According to the announcement, 300 million HT (60 percent) will be issued to users over a course of 15 days, while reserving the remaining 40 percent for platform operation, team incentives and user rewards.Huobi said the token launch “is not an initial coin offering (ICO).” Instead, the 300 million HT will be given to users who purchase a service fee package at a discount on Huobi Pro using tether (USDT) – a crypto token pegged to the U.S. dollar. Other cryptocurrencies that can also facilitate the purchase include bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin and ethereum classic.While details of the packages are yet to be revealed, the company said there will be a maximum limit for each user’s purchase and the minimal order will be 100 HT.The news marks the latest move by Huobi to recover since the business was severely affected by China’s clampdown on domestic exchanges, according to Leon Li, founder of Huobi Group. It has since shifted to an over-the-counter (OTC) trading model and targeted overseas markets.“We closed the trading book service on Sept. 15 and opened the crypto-to-crypto trading on Nov. 1 in 2017. The volume on Nov. 1 was about four to five percent of that on Sept. 15,” Li said in an interview with CoinDesk. “The impact was really significant.”Essentially, through the new issuance, Huobi will be able to gather service fees upfront while increasing the level of user “stickiness,” Li said.“For example, if you purchase the 1,000 HT package, it will only cost USDT 990, and you will get 1,000 HT for free. HT can be used for offsetting the trading fees,” the company said.The ultimate goal, according to Li, is to make HT serve as an asset that connects users at Huobi’s exchanges in Japan, South Korea and the U.S. in the future, as the company expands overseas.While business registration in the U.S. is expected to take some time, Li added, the new ventures in Japan and South Korea are planned to open in March this year.Meanwhile, HT will also be available for trading as the company’s exchange platform will offer USDT, BTC or ETH trading pairs with the token. Addressing potential concerns over price volatility, Huobi will buy back HT based on its market price every quarter with 20 percent of its net profit during the same period.Li said the funds bought back will be stored in an ethereum address as a reserve, dubbed the Huobi Investor Protection Fund, which will be made visible to the public.Leon Li image via CoinDesk archive"

Banks, she said, need to take necessary measures to combat fraudulent activities involving cryptocurrencies.The Bank of Israel’s banking supervision department has formed an internal team to look into such risks, the statement indicates.However, cryptocurrency technology poses problems for the authorities when it comes to designing regulations, she said, stating.“Our assessment is that … there is a real difficulty in issuing sweeping guidelines to the system regarding the proper way to estimate, manage, and monitor the risks inherent in such activity,” the deputy governor added.The new comes a month after Israeli financial watchdog – the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) – said that it is seeking to ban any company that has a major involvement in bitcoin trading from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.In past months, a number of other central banks and financial regulators have issued warnings as the prices of cryptocurrencies have soared to record levels.

Notably, South Korea was reportedly planning to shut down exchanges, though those rumors were later walked back by the president’s office.However, South Korea is acting on new regulations to slow down speculative investing in cryptocurrencies by forcing banks to comply with new know-your-customer rules and imposing fines on investors who refuse to cease using anonymous virtual for cryptocurrencies.Meanwhile, China has indicated it might try to reduce mining activity by withdrawing tax and power benefits for companies.Regulations image via Shutterstock"

With these updates, and others, it’s safe to say that Fortune 500 companies are now pairing with providers to explore blockchain’s uses in their businessesThese are examples of the type of adoption and validity we expected to see in 2017, but even these positive developments can still be considered scratching the surface.Government bodies are also collaborating on the many potential benefits of blockchain, and bold entrepreneurs are thinking about how the tech can be used as the basis for new smartphones and apps.Even the recent frenzied nature of bitcoin – which has stunned the investment community and has caused both scorn and praise – can’t disrupt the ongoing progress of blockchain. While we follow bitcoin’s journey, let’s look ahead at what we can expect to see unfolding in 2018:Interest in blockchain continues to be very high in Asia and the Middle East, where some of the largest banking institutions are forging ahead with blockchain projects or service offerings, particularly in payments.For example, banks in Japan and South Korea have just begun testing a blockchain technology that could achieve same-day international transfers and cut costs by nearly 30 percent.With the rise of ransomware attacks demanding cryptocurrencies, blockchain and IoT cybersecurity will emerge with defenses based on cryptocurrency technologies.While this may sound fantastical and futuristic, the emergence of blockchain cybersecurity tools may be the next big thing in blockchain. With major breaches such as Equifax proving that companies generally cannot safeguard current identity data systems, the need for a more secure blockchain-based identity approach, in which no one holds all the keys, will emerge.There was a seismic jump in ICOs in 2017, and the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies has expanded in a huge way. In the next year, the pace of ICOs will grow significantly faster, and will overtake venture capital funding.The insurance and finance sectors are two of the most likely to experience deep, and threatening, disruption from blockchain technology.Insurance will emerge as a hot area as claims processing and complex multi-party processes like subrogation will show the business value of blockchain-based automation. And, JPMorgan will open a cryptocurrency trading desk, despite Jamie Dimon’s viral comments dismissing the validity of cryptocurrencies.Blockchain will drive digital transformation of the enterprise specifically with automation, digitization of processes, tokenization of physical assets and activities and codification of complex contracts.In addition, governance issues will continue to plague bitcoin (Segwit2x), ethereum (frozen Parity funds) and others as new challenges emerge. This will drive enterprises to “private” blockchains but will not slow down the growth of core cryptocurrencies.Airplane window view via Shutterstock"

The group will determine which agencies will have jurisdiction over the domestic crypto market and create a system for collecting income taxes traced to cryptocurrency trades.The government statement goes on to read:“Moreover, the authorities were assigned to develop a mechanism for ensuring access of law enforcement bodies to the data of cryptocurrency exchanges with the obligation of the given subjects to store information about all transactions within the period established by law for financial institutions and disclosure of customer information on a motivated request.”Notably, the statement indicates that the National Bank – Ukraine’s central bank – may move to create its own cryptocurrency.“The National Bank of Ukraine is considering the relevance of establishing its own cryptocurrency,” it stated.A bill already in front of the Ukraine legislature would bring cryptocurrency exchanges under the central bank’s oversight, as previously reported.The proposed legislation contained provisions focused on the taxation and oversight of cryptocurrency exchanges and even included a provision regarding domestic mining operations. However, the legislation has not yet been passed into law, and there is no timeline set for its passage.Image via Shutterstock"

celebrate the positive. The world has seen tremendous interest in ...","Jan 9, 2018 at 02:45 UTC","Eric Piscini, a principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP, is the global leader of Deloitte’s financial services blockchain consulting efforts and co-lead at its the global blockchain and cryptocurrency team.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.As the technology behind bitcoin nears its 10th year in the market, let’s celebrate the positive.The world has seen tremendous interest in blockchain across industries and countries, from thousands of new startups, to blockchain labs popping up in commercial and federal organizations, to a number of consortia established looking to solve their industry’s biggest challenges.One can go so far as to argue that 2017 saw the democratization for cryptocurrencies.Democratization of a given technology can happen in many ways, from the number of people, products and solutions using that technology, to its business value or the level of disruption it activates. As opposed to previous technology waves – like open source – blockchain technology is, at its core, is designed to empower people versus organizations. It is thus natural that blockchain democratization is also core to its success.With kids accepting bitcoin on lemonade stands, teenagers investing in ether to pay for college and traders standing up crypto-trading desks, there is no doubt that cryptocurrencies have helped democratize blockchain. Ask anyone who has been involved in blockchain without being involved in bitcoin for proof of that. In a way, blockchain has been democratized via cryptocurrencies — but the real democratization of blockchain is about to happen.With democratization at its core, here are some of the things I expect to see happen in the year ahead.For a host of reasons, it is a critical year for every aspect of the space.2018 might very well be the year of the killer customer app on blockchain.While the CryptoKitties were cute, they also demonstrated some limitations of the technology platforms; it will likely incentivize those in the industry to develop more stable and scalable blockchains. And, as the foundations mature, we will see major advancements in the usage of blockchain solutions for consumers. Whether it be personal electric grid management, digital identity, gaming, loyalty or credit scoring, we will probably use a blockchain app in 2018 without knowing that it is backed by blockchain technology.Advancements will come in the next few months that will make the use of blockchain platforms easier than ever before. And it will happen across the main stacks of Hyperledger, ethereum and Corda, among others.This will address a key challenge that we all face today — the scarcity of talent, especially in developers and architects. When it’s easier to provision and develop on blockchain technologies, innovation will be unleashed, many more solutions will be created, which will help drive more experimentation and successful platform launches.These groups are now engaging and leading in blockchain efforts after studying and getting up to speed on the technology.They now understand the value of blockchain for themselves and their constituencies. We will see large-scale use of blockchain led by governments, probably first in developing economies and small countries where incumbents are less influential. Financial inclusion, digital identities, regulatory reporting and payments will be the main areas improved by blockchain in 2018.I believe these organizations will be the main engine in translating the promises into real commercially viable solutions, a massive role in the democratization of blockchain. Most importantly, they will have to accept that their long-term role in our economies might be dramatically different than it is today. We have seen both sides of the coin so far, pun unintended.Those taking the defensive position – like notaries – will go the dinosaur way. On the other hand, those going on offense, with aggressive moves from major corporations, like banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, will help build the next generation of business platforms on blockchain.The biggest question: Will they be nimble enough to compete with the startups? Will they be protected by regulations? Will they generate return on their investments so far?When it comes to talent, which is the first thing I think about when I wake up each morning, the job market too will be impacted and blockchain will offer new productive lives for many. The decentralization of work has already started and I’m a big believer that blockchain will fuel its growth. Imagine a world where each of us can monetize our time, skills and experiences on-demand and be rewarded with micropayments from a decentralized platform.Work has been democratized many times over but it might very well be the last phase.All that said, there might be a downside to the democratization of blockchain. If you consider blockchain as a non-human trustee, autonomous organizations running on blockchain are – as we have seen with the DAO – not so sci-fi anymore. Democratization of technology often requires strong ethical behaviors and, sometimes, a regulatory framework. We cannot overstate these aspects in our race to introduce blockchain to the world.No, I did not forget cryptocurrencies and other tokens.They have reached democratization in financial markets already, with many exchanges and financial instruments. Will it open a new wave for anyone to invest into a new asset class, will it burst into flames, will it enhance existing businesses, or will it create new decentralized business models? All of the above, which is why 2018 is going to be the most exciting year in blockchain so far.Democratizing blockchain will be central for us in 2018, as I believe it will generate an unprecedented level of change in the next decade.Participation image via Shutterstock"

According to the latest update, other deposit methods ...","Jan 26, 2018 at 16:10 UTC",Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has confirmed that it has suffered what appears to be the biggest hack in the history of the technology.,"In a press conference at 23:30 JST (14:30 UST), the exchange’s president Wakata Koichi Yoshihiro and chief operating officer Yusuke Otsuka estimated its loss at 58 billion yen (approx. $533 million). According to Bloomberg, which attended the conference, 500 million NEM tokens were taken from Coincheck’s digital wallets.Tweets by Nikkei appeared to indicate that the precise amount stolen may not be fully known until further checks have been carried out into the intrusion.But though the exact dollar figure for the incident is hard to pin down (given the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies and the company’s lack of information), data suggests the figure is now at least over $400 million, factoring for a decline in the value of XEM, the NEM protocol’s token, following the incident.At press time, the price of XEM was $0.85, down from a high of $1.01 today, according to data from Coinmarketcap.Notably, the dollar amount stolen from Coincheck is likely greater than the amount stolen from Mt. Gox in 2014 (pegged at $340 million), though the impact on the cryptocurrency market will be much smaller given the immense increases in market capitalization since.Rumors had been circulating about the theft since early this morning when Coincheck abruptly froze most of its services.The firm announced on its website around 13:00 JST (04:00 UTC) that it had restricted deposits, trading and withdrawal of XEM, the token running on the NEM blockchain.A wider suspension on withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies as well as Japanese yen was announced around 30 minutes later. In the following hour, trading of all cryptocurrencies was also restricted, except bitcoin. According to the latest update, other deposit methods including credit cards have also been stopped.Coincheck is looking into compensating its customers, its executives also announced.It was also revealed that Coincheck was not registered with Japan’s Financial Services Agency, but now plans to do so. Coincheck’s president said he “deeply regretted” the issue.CoinDesk is following this developing story.Image via Coincheck conference"

as OB1's CEO Brian Hoffman announced at Token Summit II recently ...","Jan 13, 2018 at 11:30 UTC","The web has taken over our lives, and with that, online enterprises have grown into huge monoliths of power.","Yet, while tech giants give us access to the stuff we like – music, movies, shopping – blockchain enthusiasts think an individual’s web experience could be greatly improved by decentralization.If the web’s giants decentralize, the web itself will become a wildly different place – it’s hard to even wrap your head around, just like it would have been impossible to imagine meme culture in 1999.Today, a site and its database are one entity. In the decentralized version, the database doesn’t belong to its creators; it belongs to its community, and that community can build lots of different business models on top of the database.Think of it like this: if the web had been decentralized from the beginning, you could have made your first social media profile on Friendster in 2003. Then, when MySpace came along, you wouldn’t need to create a new profile, you’d just give MySpace permission to access the one you had already made for Friendster. Same thing for Facebook.Obviously, each new site would add new features and ways of interacting, but users would not have needed to start over, lose friends from other sites or the content created on prior platforms.Are those advantages strong enough to upend the Dot-Com era’s familiar incumbents?Entrepreneurs and the various investors who have committed capital – whether that be in the form of traditional venture capital, or perhaps more common in the space today, through initial coin offerings (ICOs) – have made their bets that it is.And with ICOs providing not only a new fundraising mechanism for these blockchain startups, but also a tool for users to interact with these new distributed networks, the underlying infrastructure for a new internet – a “web 3.0” – is growing.Below are three verticals on the web that blockchain startups are aiming to take market share from through the use of crypto tokens.While eBay is an internet O.G., in the early days of the web, there were also other sites built around specific products, such as comic books, where sellers sold directly to buyers.One might imagine that focused marketplaces would naturally provide a better customer experience, but eBay, which offered an array of different products, proved that wrong. It turned out that it was better to sell comic books on the site that also sold bicycle parts, because someone might come looking for one and end up buying both. On top of that, it was just easier to remember one site for buying used stuff, rather than many.While there’s nothing stopping a seller from offering one product on both a specialized site and a general site, such as eBay, it would take sophisticated software to make sure the same item didn’t get sold twice, and eBay doesn’t want to make that kind of thing easy.But what if consumers could have both? What if the comic books, for example, lived in the same database as the all the other products, but different websites could be built around that data? In that way, a listing could show up in a variety of marketplaces, but if one listing sold on any one marketplace, it would show as sold on all of them.That’s possible, according to Gee Chuang, the CEO of Listia, an existing marketplace that’s developing a decentralized version of eBay called Ink Protocol:“Ink Protocol’s vision is to decentralize peer-to-peer marketplaces, taking the power away from the companies that run them and giving it back to the buyers and sellers. As a result, more value is distributed back to the actual user.”In an effort to create this system, Listia plans to sell $15 million worth of crypto tokens, starting on Jan. 29. Listia will also seed early users of its existing marketplace, where people already earn Listia credits for trading items peer-to-peer, with the token. Listia credits will convert into the crypto tokens as the blockchain network launches.It’s a similar goal to OB1’s OpenBazaar, one of the longest-running and most popular decentralized marketplaces, except that OB1 is also focused on making it easier for users to transact anonymously, and has only used bitcoin for transacting. Yet, that could soon change, as OB1’s CEO Brian Hoffman announced at Token Summit II recently that that company would be pursuing a token offering in response to increased congestion on the bitcoin network.Speaking to the benefits of a decentralized marketplace, Listia’s Chuang said, “Sellers in decentralized marketplaces have the freedom to use any platform they like at any time, while bringing that hard-earned reputation with them everywhere they go.”YouTube is the number one place in the world to share and search for video.While the site has created a new career path for content creators, the tensions between those creators and its central administrators have become heated.Content creators suffer as YouTube decreases its revenue share with video makers and uses automation to pull advertisements from their videos if they suspect the video displays offensive or inappropriate behavior, catching some suitable videos in its wide net. Consumers, meanwhile, complain that advertisements are becoming too prevalent on the site in general.A new generation of startups believes decentralizing their platforms will allow content creators to interact directly with their audiences with the use of a crypto token. At the same time, users will get more choice in how their attention can be monetized – they can view ads, release personal information or even contribute part of their computing power to the operation of the system.“Bittorrent — with more than 250 million users worldwide — has been already proven to be capable of delivering good quality content in a decentralized and compelling manner,” said Adrian Garelik, CEO of Flixxo, a decentralized video sharing platform that closed its token sale in November.Released in 2001, Bittorrent works by connecting users to copies of content held on other people’s devices, rather than a centralized server system. And Garelik envisions making the torrent network more robust by giving people more incentive to host content by earning cryptocurrency.“By creating this incentivized network, any kind of content could be distributed in a peer-to-peer fashion, with a lot of monetization possibilities,” Garelik said.According to Flixxo creators, users of peer-to-peer file sharing platforms have been in need of an effective peer-to-peer payment system to make the platforms more useful. And that seems to be a thought shared by a number of blockchain-based startups looking to decentralize file sharing, including Stream, Theta and Livepeer, each that has its own token.And that’s not all of them – there are handfuls of players at each level of the online video stack.As explained by another decentralized video company Paratii in a blog post:“What we see forming is not a single pyramidal stack, where the choice of one piece of tech inevitably ‘disables’ another. Rather, what we have are protocol silos, with more or less interoperable layers.”It’s possibly taken years to purchase and download all that music that gets your heart racing when you’re at the gym or mellows you out after a long day of work – the perfect soundtrack to your life.And just as special as all that is to you, those tastes are just as important to the companies that control the online music marketplaces where you get that music. That’s because, as users participate in marketplaces like Apple Music, they build up their own intellectual property by creating playlists, following artists and flagging their favorite songs.And that data is lucrative for the marketplaces to track and control, so much so that they make it difficult to move those preferences to another service.According to Jesse Grushack from Consensys’s Ujo, a blockchain-based music supply chain provider:“We are being locked into these systems controlled by corporate giants.”And many startups, not just Ujo, agree. A handful of blockchain-based companies have started up looking to disrupt various layers of the music industry, including Viberate, which looks to eliminate the need for musicians’ rent-seeking agents with smart contracts.Even more mainstream names are seeing potential benefits in adopting blockchain and cryptocurrency in the music biz. Icelandic singer Bjork announced in November that she’d be accepting four different cryptocurrencies for her forthcoming album, and a former Universal Music Group executive raised $1.2 million in October for a music-rights management platform called Blokur that uses the ethereum blockchain.While many of these platforms haven’t announced crypto token sales, Grushack admitted that Ujo might issue a token down the road.Currently, though, the company is focused on the concept of a “portable fan badge” – a token-like instrument that links identity to data – so that as a fan, you could port what musicians, songs and genres you like across all different kinds of music marketplaces. In this way, Grushack said, the musician would really know a person is a fan, and could then market them new content directly.And not only that, but the portal is designed to make it easier for any number of parties to share rights, for example of one song, where each musician that participated gets paid out based on the work they put in. While this is technically possible today, the process would require a significant number of intermediaries who would all want to take a cut, making it worthless for artists today.“Right now Apple is in the process of phasing out purchases for music, so that leaves us in a scenario where everything we consume is in a rental model,” Grushack said, adding:“If we did transition back into a system in which we bought music, being able to own that music and relationship regardless of the platform is something blockchain enables.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blokur, Livepeer and OB1.App icons image via Shutterstock"

Reality Shares’ Nasdaq NextGen Economy ETF (BLCN) opened at $24.20, while Amplify’s Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) started closer to $20.Both ETFs will exclusively invest in blockchain-based companies, according to a previous CoinDesk article. When the prospectuses were first filed in November 2017, the companies noted that investing in blockchain startups could be risky, as there are few regulations on the technology and companies may not necessarily turn a profit.However, the prospectuses also noted that the funds would only invest in companies with a market capitalization of greater than $200 million and which had a six-month daily trading average of at least $1 million.Reality Shares has developed an index with Nasdaq to track blockchain startups which the ETF will utilize, said Kian Salehizadeh, an analyst with Reality Shares. Nasdaq’s blockchain research team forms part of the index’s contributors. The index is further supported by an algorithm developed by Reality Shares.Salehizadeh continued:“We wanted to do a blockchain technology-related ETF, so not another bitcoin fund but something that takes advantage of the underlying ecosystem. So we developed a methodology in-house which measures seven quantitative factors and we run those factors on a universe of publicly traded [data].”He further told CoinDesk that the company’s ETF originally contained the word “blockchain” in its name, but the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had his company remove the term.While the SEC has not formally issued an approval of the ETFs, the lack of a formal disapproval means the ETFs were automatically approved under current law, Salehizadeh explained. At present, the SEC has 75 days to issue a disapproval or objection to an ETF filing. If no such disapproval or objection is stated, the funds can be listed.Companies have previously filed for blockchain-based ETFs, but none had made it as far as listing prior to Reality Shares and Amplify Trust. Most recently, Horizons ETFs Management filed for a blockchain ETF in November.Editor’s note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated both ETFs appear on Nasdaq’s exchange.

projects like bitcoin with enthusiasm. Six years ago, I wrote a piece ...","Jan 31, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","Jason Calacanis is an angel investor in 150 startups including Uber, robinhood, Abra, thumbtack, Wealthfront and Talla. He’s also the author of ANGEL. ","“If you are right, that 90 percent of crypto projects are scams or incompetent, what do you gain by taking that position publicly?” asked a close friend.I took a moment to think it through.Why was I sounding the alarm on Twitter, my podcast and CNBC that civilians should be very careful investing in cryptocurrencies that are unregulated, anonymous, easily manipulated, phenomenally hackable, global and often run by bad actors or the incompetent?“To protect people from losing their money?” I answered.I’ve got a complicated relationship with crypto, having monitored early projects like bitcoin with enthusiasm.Six years ago, I wrote a piece called “The Most Dangerous Project We’ve Ever Seen,” that introduced many in the investment community to bitcoin.Full disclosure: While I don’t trade cryptocurrencies, I have a lot of exposure to it by investments in startups like Robinhood, Abra, and Talla.com (to name a few notable projects).Here are five important points I would like to state for the record:It would take me 10 articles to catalogue all the risks and scams in this emerging space, but to give you the broad strokes here are the critical issues that most savvy people — including those with large positions in crypto — all agree on.Billions of dollars in crypto have already been stolen, and most of the initial coin offerings ICOs I see are horrible ideas run by people who have no track record or ability to execute.Bitconnect is an instructive example. Most importantly, you should watch this hilarious video:And read about these pump-and-dump chat rooms, where thousands of people (it seems) are buying crypto coins before marketing them to the next group of suckers.Now, it is possible that while most projects fail, most of the money in crypto could wind up going to a smaller number of higher quality projects that become long-term successes — but that is obviously not guaranteed.In fact, it’s possible that bitcoin could go to zero (which I talk about below).ICOs, or initial coin offerings, are the black eye of the crypto industry for a number of reasons.Most of them have untested teams, and that doesn’t mean that those teams won’t eventually build very successful companies, but it does mean that investors (or, rather, donors) are taking serious risks.When you look at an ICO, understand that there are multiple levels of significant risks stacked on top of each other.Most ICOs share most of these risks:If you compare this stack of risks to a startup, here is what I do for a living in terms of taking risk:Now, I’m not saying I will never buy tokens, but it’s very clear to me that tokens are most often either a Kickstarter contribution (you know, without the product being sent two years late), a donation, a gift to incompetent people, or a scam.There are probably 10 percent — a guess on my part — of these projects that are going to see the light of day and have a similar chance of success as an angel investment.So, of that small number maybe 10 percent to 20 percent will succeed.This leads me to believe that 98 percent of these projects will result in people losing their money. That means you have to make about 50x your money on one of 50 token purchases to break even.That might happen; I had a 3,000x+ investment, and a handful of 20-50x investments as an angel investor.The bitcoin HODL crowd (a play on words for “hold,” as in hold your coins, never sell or spend them) think this claim is insane, but we’ve watched many times as the early projects in a promising vertical go to zero and the 10th goes to the moon.Many of us used AskJeeves, Lycos, and LookSmart before Google showed up in 1998. Many of us used SixDegrees, Friendster, LiveJournal, and MySpace before Facebook in 2004.Bitcoin is facing massive challenges around speed of transactions, the size of the blockchain, transaction costs and governance.That last issue could be the thing that takes it down. If you want to jump down that rabbit hole, you can watch this video:The majority case in my mind is that bitcoin will, as the first technology out of the gate, be supplanted by a much better technology. This could be a fork of bitcoin or simply a new, much better product.As time moves on, consumers get savvier, and that means they recognize a better product quicker and move to it faster and faster. We’ve seen this with people jumping from Hotmail to Gmail, BlackBerries to iPhones, and dialup to broadband internet.Consumers will not have the loyalty to bitcoin that they have to their email account and BlackBerries, because they don’t actually use bitcoin for anything other than speculation. The switching cost will be zero, as opposed to switching your phone, which requires backing up your data, moving your phone number, and setting up your new iPhone and selling your BlackBerry.We could see a run on bitcoin that happens in days or hours, not years like the decline of RIM (BlackBerry’s parent company) and AOL.I’m guessing we will see an Amazon, Google or Netflix-like company come out of the crypto space. When we do, there will be a ten-year window to buy their stock and be rewarded.As such, if you are in love with the crypto space, my advice to you is:That last part is the critical one. I’ve had to have a heart-to-heart with a number of friends who bought bitcoin early and who are “crypto rich and cash poor.”If 90 percent of your wealth is in any one currency that is a very bad idea — unless you control that currency, i.e., if you were Jeff Bezos, owning a lot of Amazon stock isn’t a huge problem because you control the company and have massive insight into it.If you take people’s money for a token that you hope will someday have utility, understand that the person buying it believes — 99 percent of the time — that this is a security.If people buy your token to make money it is no longer a utility token, even if those buyers signed a document that says, “I’m buying a utility token not a security.”Why? Because some percentage of our legal system and regulators will side with retail investors. You will get dragged into court and be forced to explain why you did a countdown clock to sell your utility tokens and why you hired promoters to sell them around the world.Even if you win, it will be a horrible victory. Just ask the people who were sued after the dotcom implosion. It took the brutal part of a decade for most the them to clear their names even if they were in the right — others got lifetime bans.Also, as Rob May from Talla points out, there can be additional costs to ICOs that founders might not consider.I don’t hate crypto, but I do hate seeing people get scammed out of their money.The space is now driven by scams, FOMO, and FOCO (fear of cashing out.), which means it’s going to end very badly for a lot of people.Feel free to invest a lot of your time, if so inclined, but be very careful with your money.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra.Money in drain concept via Shutterstock"

Mandelker also noted that the U.S. is cooperating with other countries to regulate cryptocurrencies in general.The European Union is in the process of developing more stringent regulations for financial institutions to prevent terrorist financing.as well, she said.FinCEN has already begun taking enforcement actions as well, she said, citing the U.S.’s shutdown and fine on the former BTC-e exchange, as well as the fine on its alleged operator Alexander Vinnik.Legal paraphernalia image via Shutterstock"

78,www.coindesk.com,"Jan 30, 2018",This Token Promises Not to Spam You on Social Media,https://www.coindesk.com/j8t-token-promises-wont-spam-social-media,"Members include Uriel Peled (Cointree Capital), Eyal Herzog (Bancor) and 
the founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Jon Matonis.","Jan 30, 2018 at 09:00 UTC","If one token’s newly announced marketing strategy is any indication, the Federal Trade Commission may soon have more warnings to send to social influencers.","Announced today, Singapore-based marketing company Jet8 is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) designed to scale its system for rewarding regular users who effectively promote brands on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and more. As such, the idea effectively merges a contentious ad model with the red-hot crypto market, itself no stranger to controversy.But cryptocurrency doesn’t actually mark that big of a shift for Jet8.In an age where elite Instagram models can earn thousands from a single post, the company has made it easier for brands to scale their social reach by enlisting more average users. Users, in turn, are able to leverage the Jet8 app to share photos or posts with branded frames that then get distributed to major social media platforms.Once Jet8 launches its own cryptocurrency, however, those rewards will take the form of fungible money. And there’s little risk to brands because they only have to pay rewards for shares that garner actual reactions.This design is where the benefit lies.Today, the company’s influencers receive rewards in the form of a virtual currency tracked on its internal ledger system. Jet8 has awarded 4 billion of its virtual tokens to date, points which then must be redeemed at convenience stores in Asia or through an app store.But with a traditional virtual currency, Jet8 must rely on traditional tactics, negotiating deals with companies to make the tokens redeemable. In this way, the company believes an ethereum-based cryptocurrency can open up the platform to brands.Shannon Cullum, chief marketing officer for the startup, said that cryptocurrency gives the product more value, stating:“The increased transparency, flexibility and scalability, that’s the rationale for integrating the blockchain into the project.”To demonstrate the potential of its platform, Jet8 is giving supporters a chance to earn tokens by posting testimonial videos about why they are excited about the token sale. The more engagement these videos receive, the more J8T they will yield.Cullum himself even kicked off the contest on Instagram.In contrast to this user-first model, Jet8 has worked under more of an agency approach. In the past, brands would come to it with an idea for a campaign, a target audience and a budget. It would create brand assets for the campaign and message influencers about the opportunity.Jet8’s secret weapon has been its ability to track the success of different posts. It follows them as they go out onto the web, and it tracks which ones generate engagement. Brands can watch the reach stack up as the campaign goes on through a dashboard that the company provides.The dashboard squares with a larger trend of brands bringing influencer marketing in-house.For example, Jet8 recently launched an app-as-a-service model called the Full Stack App. A brand can create its own app that works exactly like Jet8’s, except it can be customized to look like the brand’s own technology, from which it can launch its campaigns directly.“The advantage of that model is they will be able to create these communities and in a sense decentralize the whole thing,” Cullum explained. “It’s the same technology, the same methodology.”Still, jumpstarting the Jet8 token by decentralizing a network won’t necessarily be easy, even with tools that could enable such an expansion.To start, there’s the matter of cultivating a user base. The company will aim to sell $36 million worth of its tokens in an ICO, auctioning off 30 percent of a total 1.5 billion token supply. (Tokens sold in the public sale will go for $0.10 per J8T, the company said.)Overall, Jet8 expects to raise 70 percent of its ICO goal through a private sale in advance. And while it has declined to disclose investors in the round, it did offer advisory board details. Members include Uriel Peled (Cointree Capital), Eyal Herzog (Bancor) and the founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation, Jon Matonis.Yet, if this token catches on, its hard to imagine that social media won’t become an even more intense stream of brand messaging. After all, there’s no denying it’s already getting weird among major influencers using traditional tools.Still, Cullum argued that baldly avaricious sharing won’t be rewarded.“If I post a Coca-Cola asset on my Facebook page and it’s just blatant advertising. I probably won’t get any likes comments or shares,” he said.As such, the Jet8 app and token seeks to guide people to post authentic experience with campaign branding that people would respond to either way.“The way we design the assets, it’s very much about key moments,” Cullum said.Spam flyers image via Shutterstock"

currencies from Wyoming's money transmitter laws. Alone, this legislation 
will ...","Jan 27, 2018 at 12:31 UTC","Rep. Tyler Lindholm is a rancher in Sundance, Wyoming, and a Republican member of the Wyoming House of Representatives. Caitlin Long, a Wyoming native, is former chairman and president of Symbiont and a former managing director of Morgan Stanley.","Wyoming is stepping up to welcome the blockchain community with open arms. A grassroots group, the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, has garnered significant momentum to pass a package of legislation that would bring significant benefits to both the blockchain community and the State of Wyoming. The package of blockchain bills, which will be introduced during the upcoming session in February, will build on two characteristics of Wyoming that make it particularly attractive to the blockchain industry: zero corporate income or franchise taxes, and strict privacy laws governing LLCs formed in the state. Companies don’t need to move to Wyoming physically to take advantage, just as most Delaware corporations aren’t located in Delaware. But but there are real reasons why businesses might want to move there. Cheyenne, the state capital, has tremendous  fiber-optic bandwidth and cheap power that is already attracting major data centers to locate there, for example. And our initiative has active support by officials at the state’s only university. So Wyoming has “good bones” upon which to build a regulatory framework to attract the blockchain sector.The blockchain community is likely to be most excited by one of the bills just introduced, H.B.0070, which would exempt tokens issued on an open blockchain from Wyoming’s money transmitter and securities laws, as long as the token has not been marketed as an investment and is exchangeable for goods or services. This bill would also exempt token exchanges (or people exchanging tokens) from being deemed broker/dealers under Wyoming law. The bill has garnered senior co-sponsors, including the Speaker of the House.As always, whether a token would be considered, under Wyoming law, either a security or exempt pursuant to the new legislation, would be a facts-and-circumstances analysis. Businesses should seek their own legal counsel.We view non-securities blockchain tokens as a new asset class that is neither money nor securities, and therefore believe existing money transmitter and securities regulations should not apply. In many cases, for example, such blockchain tokens are simply prepaid software licenses. If tradeable gift cards and prepaid cell phone minutes are not regulated as money or securities, why should prepaid software licenses fall into those categories? In many states, they do. In Wyoming, they should not, and we are optimistic that the legislature will agree.Wyoming’s consumers will be protected by its strong anti-fraud and consumer protection laws, which we believe are sufficient to deter bad actors from doing business in the state. And businesses should analyze whether federal securities laws would still apply.The Wyoming Blockchain Coalition also supports two other bills as part of the package for the February session. The so-called “bitcoin bill,” H.B.0019, proposes to exempt virtual currencies from Wyoming’s money transmitter laws. Alone, this legislation will allow businesses that pulled out of Wyoming in 2015, such as Coinbase, to operate in Wyoming. This will add a vital new industry to the State’s financial sector. It, too, has garnered many co-sponsors, including the President of the Senate. The third bill, the so-called “filings bill,” would enable the Secretary of State to collect registrations on a blockchain, similar to that enacted by the State of Delaware last July. It would cover the filings made for corporations, LLCs and UCC financing statements. The goal of this legislation is to allow the official record of ownership and the official record of changes of ownership to exist on a blockchain. Eventually this will allow the State, counties, municipalities and businesses to eliminate paper trails such as deeds, titles and receipts.Wyoming led the way when it passed the nation’s first LLC law in 1977, and it can again be first by offering the ability to register LLCs on a blockchain. This could attract meaningful business to register in Wyoming, as academic research shows that nearly two-thirds of new companies that register in the U.S. are LLCs. New types of LLC users, such as those seeking to limit liability for autonomous cars and other internet of things (IoT) devices, could be attracted to efficiencies enabled by blockchain-registered Wyoming LLCs. This is especially true for series LLCs, which is another initiative supported by the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition. LLCs are so popular in Wyoming today that there is almost one for every two citizens of the state.Wyoming can become a haven for the blockchain sector, building on its already-attractive attributes, if the package of blockchain bills are enacted. The bills provide tremendous benefits for blockchain businesses that either locate or register in Wyoming, as well as significant upside to the State. We welcome the blockchain community’s support in bringing these efforts to fruition.As we say in Wyoming, let ‘er buck!The authors wish to thank David Pope, Rob Jennings, the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition and Coin Center for their assistance.Wyoming landscape image via Shutterstock"

The statement reads:“We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.  Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame. As Tether is the first company in the space to undergo this process and pursue this level of transparency, there is no precedent set to guide the process nor any benchmark against which to measure its success.”The company remains “committed to the process,” the spokesperson added.Eagle-eyed cryptocurrency enthusiasts on Twitter had raised doubts about the status of the relationship last week, noting that Friedman had dropped Bitfinex’s name from the list of clients on the audit firm’s website. Friedman did not return calls and emails from CoinDesk over the course of the week.In a preliminary report released in September, Friedman said Tether had $442.9 million of cash on reserve, matching the outstanding issuance of USDT – but that assessment was not a full audit and contained numerous caveats.Image via Shutterstock."

Yet notably, none of the proposed offerings would have held bitcoin directly – rather, their price movements would have been driven by changes in the still-nascent market for bitcoin futures.In letters dated Jan. 8, Direxion and ELF withdrew their requests, citing feedback from the SEC.As Angela Brickl, Direxion’s secretary, wrote:“On a call with the Staff on January 5, 2018, the Staff expressed concerns regarding the liquidity and valuation of the underlying instruments in which the Fund intends to primarily invest and requested that the Trust withdraw the Amendment until such time as these concerns are resolved. In response to the Staff’s request, the Trust respectfully requests withdrawal of the Amendment.”ProShares’ letter, dated Jan. 9, includes similar language. “This request for withdrawal is being made in response to a request from the Staff,” Richard Morris, general counsel and secretary for ProShares, wrote.The timing of these withdrawals is notable, given that the SEC just released two other rule change proposals which could allow for a bitcoin ETF last week. Those proposals, filed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe), would exempt its proposed ETFs from several market manipulation rules which govern traditional assets. The SEC is seeking public input on the proposals.Both of the proposed rule changes note that bitcoin does not behave like traditional assets.While the SEC has released the Cboe proposals for public comment, it has a longer history of pressing for bitcoin ETF proposal withdrawals. Several organizations killed their ETF efforts last year at the request of the agency – at the same time, at least two of these proposals were denied because bitcoin futures contracts did not exist at the time.SEC emblem image via Shutterstock"

The ad blocker can be enabled by going to ‘settings’, and it will automatically detect and stop the mining scripts written into the code of a webpage.”Opera estimates that more than a billion devices worldwide are slowed down by website-based cryptocurrency miners that users do not realize are “cryptojacking” their browsers. On the other side of the browsing experience, the company believes there are now more than 3 million websites with embedded cryptocurrency miners.Making it tricky for users to know there’s a problem, there may be no visual cue that a miner is taking advantage of a web browser, according to the firm.Cryptocurrency miners can overload smartphones’ CPUs, forcing 100 percent usage and potentially causing a phone to overheat.And the damage can sometimes be permanent. According to a ZDNet article, one trojan generated so much heat in a phone, its battery became swollen, permanently damaging the phone. While excessive ads were one reason for the heat generation, the main cause was that the phone’s CPU was hijacked to mine for Monero.The trojan was so effective, it “wrecked the phone within 48 hours,” according to the article.Opera’s new feature is already available, and the browser can be downloaded from the Google Play store, according to the release.Opera image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 10, 2018 at 13:00 UTC","Christopher Pallotta and Vincent Molinari are the co-founders of Templum, an alternative trading system designed for cryptographic assets.","The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review.As we enter 2018, it appears that blockchain’s contribution to capital formation has only begun.An unfortunate influx of both naive and bad actors begs for regulatory scrutiny, obscuring the intentions of ethical market participants anxious to operate within an informed set of dynamic guidelines and eventual laws.In this environment, many anticipate increased regulatory action and enforcement by the SEC against issuers in 2018, and we will. But I don’t expect the actions to stop there.We will also likely see enforcement actions against certain “exchanges,” which transacted in coins that are definitely securities. We will likely see FINRA jumping in with the SEC bringing actions against individuals who acted as placement agents and finders in taking compensation for ICO sales. Unlicensed investment banks or unauthorized entities will be regulatory targets, having conducted securities business for their ICO activities.Of major importance for everyone involved during this time will be the need for quality education, alleviating confusion surrounding how blockchain’s facilitation of financial transactions differs from cryptocurrencies.As a capital formation tool, blockchain is likely to increase the reach of both small- and large-scale fundings, adding a tangible new layer of transparency for issuers and regulators alike, while confirming KYC (know your customer) suitability compliance and providing investor protection, straight through processing.We will see increased collaboration between the blockchain or crypto community and currently regulated entities, as a movement toward asset quality and rigorous due diligence begins to dominate the marketplace.The result will be increased activity and investment by institutional investors and venture capitalists.As for what that transition will look like in practice, those who are familiar with current practices in the token economy should expect cosmetic changes.The entry of new market participants will greatly expand pools of capital, but the vast majority of ICOs will embrace issuance as securities, given the clear guidance from the SEC. In response, there will be very few “true” utility token issuances in 2018. The SAFT framework will rapidly decline as an issuing structure.In response, I expect that a new second-generation acronym (such as tokenized asset offering or “TAO”) will replace ICO. Increasing bad press, regulatory enforcement and class action lawsuits (concerning coins issued before the infamous DAO) may dominate headlines, and ultimately, tarnish the monicker.But this new model won’t just be the same idea with a new coat of paint. Expect the SEC, CFTC and FINRA to collaborate on industry guidelines that merge the priorities of each, very similarly to how the SEC and NASSA cooperated for Reg A+ during the JOBS Act.A regulatory oversight consortium would propose multi-agency rules for tokens, addressing their dual role in capital raising and eventual transactions as a secondary instrument.This could create a pathway for perhaps an integrated hybrid token, one which is not only a security but also maintains a derivative utility function and or an alternate currency status, which may settle the utility vs. security vs. commodity debate.That’s not to say some things won’t be lost.The early days of ICOs will be credited with introducing and accelerating the use of smart contracts for aggregating capital. Heralded as the catalyst for major Wall Street disruption, tokenized securities will lead to a second generation of market participants, scaling global capital formation upward.2018 will see the acceptance and rapid growth of TAO-style instruments, as the next wave dwarfs 2017’s ICO issuance. An amnesty program for pre-DAO participants is also in order, for those inclined to view their tokens as securities, deserving of a regulatory framework.The market will update functionality and build out new infrastructure for the sector. Securities trade clearance, settlement, transfer, depository and custody methods will evolve alongside modernized securities laws, lending greater transparency to regulators and comfort to participants. Standardized and immutable smart contract audit trails and archiving invite large institutions and venture capitalists to use this new tool to drive changes in the democratized access to capital, secondary liquidity and wealth creation that blockchain brings.Traditional large financial service institutions will enter the space by acquiring early-stage market participants, while others build theirs out organically or by poaching teams. Bulge bracket firms will eventually wake up to market share erosion and realize that tradable TAO assets could become a significant trading desk product, which features monetizable profit margin, volumes and volatility.The future of smart contracts as an essential tool in finance is solidified and irreversible.But, we don’t think it will just be money flows that benefit. The acceptance of blockchain and arrival of smart contracts is likely to have far-reaching benefits.Social media will democratize tokenized securities promotion by expanding the issuer’s reach beyond established funding channels. Updated capital formation, compounded by stronger investor education, can level the commercial playing field for women, affinity groups, fan bases and diaspora communities that also benefit from impact investing’s many constructive side effects.Channeling capital toward the underutilized global female brain trust could empower a mass of resource-deprived entrepreneurs, business leaders and innovators. This intersection of democratized capital, tech advances and social media may even begin a tectonic paradigm shift that accelerates gender equality.In this way, we expect blockchain crowdfunding to ensure greater financial independence for women, a result which will confirm that United Nations Sustainable Development Goal number five (gender equality).Thanks to blockchain, 2018 will be a year of change and volatility, but we hope, inclusion as well.Zen garden image via Shutterstock"

The government has set up a committee with the central bank and various government departments to study possible regulations.“The government’s position is clear, we don’t recognize this as legal currency as of now,” he said at the time.In contrast to his comments on cryptocurrencies, Jaitley mentioned blockchain technology in a more positive light during Thursday’s speech, noting its use in recording transactions or data without requiring an intermediate platform.“The Government will explore [the] use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in [a] digital economy,” he said, per the transcript.The comments have raised fears that India is moving to ban cryptocurrencies outright, though it remains to be seen what specific measures the government will introduce following Jaitley’s comments.Image Credit: WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM/swiss-image.ch/Photo Jolanda Flubacher (from Flickr.com)"

He also openly opposed the legislative delay of the Dodd-Frank act, which was enacted for investor protection in response to the 2008 financial crisis.Previously, Chilton has made comments arguing that, while the U.S. should embrace the potential of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, he believes proper regulations are needed for a sustainable growth of the industry, especially when it comes to protecting investors.

In the cryptocurrency space, the big question is whether you can have decentralization and scale it too.","The struggle between these two goals has become more noticeable as a rush of new enthusiasts have entered the space, lured by the technology being floated as a fix to many of the world’s problems (well, that and greed).Underscoring the urgency of the problem, a number of researchers are studying whether there’s a balance to be struck between decentralization – the key non-financial motivation for cryptocurrency and blockchain excitement – and these networks’ ability to scale to an ever-growing number of users.Cornell University researcher Adem Efe Gencer explains the predicament well, telling CoinDesk:“The key impetus behind the interest in blockchains is decentralization of power among entities with minimal trust relationships. But, there’s a fundamental tension between scale and decentralization. While we know how to get scale, scaling solutions may require compromising the decentralized nature of blockchains.”And this dilemma has become more serious as users face deep transaction backlogs and rising transaction fees on the most popular blockchains dealing with the weight of increased adoption.In response, many wonder whether the blockchain deserves all the attention it’s currently receiving – or if it’s yet another overhyped technology sector where expectations outpace actual usefulness.At this point, there are solutions under development, such as bitcoin’s Lightning Network, but there are always trade-offs to be made.Gencer’s new paper and a handful of others recently published explore just how decentralized the most popular blockchains are, and how resistant they will be in the future to being taken taken over by a controlling force as new technology for scaling is added.Mirroring the debates in the bitcoin community about the best way to overcome the problem, the researchers each stressed different possible solutions in their findings: on-chain, off-chain and at the consensus protocol level.In their paper, Gencer and his co-authors aim to “scientifically quantify” the decentralization of the networks bitcoin and ethereum.To do this, the paper brings together a range of metrics, including how many miners (the stakeholders that order and verify transactions on the network with the use of computer hardware) a network has, how many nodes, how much bandwidth it takes to send blocks across the network and so forth.Looking at this big picture can help researchers to potentially address the scalability problem. Gencer told CoinDesk:“While we know how to get scale, scaling solutions may require compromising the decentralized nature of blockchains.”With that in mind, the research sheds some light on the “viability of different scaling proposals.”For example, the block size can be increased up to 1.7 times to improve on-chain scaling without harming decentralization in some ways, the authors found.It’s worth noting Gencer and his colleagues’ findings have been debated fiercely on social media. Because decentralization is such a complex property to measure in a system like bitcoin, many contend other elements of decentralization would need to be taken into account to get the full picture.Another quantitatively focused paper exploring the issue was published on arXiv last week by Greg Slepak, the founder of decentralized technology non-profit OkTurtles.The paper describes the “basic theory” behind the scalability problem by way of a triangle (another researcher, Ocean Protocol founder Trent McConaghy, independently came up with this same idea).Each point of the triangle represents one of the three properties that blockchains need – scale, the ability to support many users; decentralization, a state of affairs in which no one entity controls the system; and consensus, the agreement between each node on the validity of transactions.Just as one line of a triangle can touch only two of the three points, so too, are blockchain developers only able to focus and succeed in two of the three properties necessary for decentralized blockchains.For instance, blockchain developers can have a system that scales and reaches consensus, but it will be at the expense of full decentralization.Still, Slepak’s research was more optimistic than Gencer’s, since the paper claims there’s evidence that off-chain networks, such as Lightning Network, can “get around” this tricky trio of trade-offs.To do so, the paper contends, off-chain solutions like bitcoin’s Lightning Network can “relax” the definition of consensus. Rather than requiring nodes to hold every transaction that ever happens within the system, nodes only need to keep track of some transactions requested by users in ‘rare moments.'”Arguing that his research describes, in more formal terms, the trade-offs that have been at the heart of bitcoin’s years-long scaling debate, Slepak told CoinDesk:“This seems pretty important to me given the fuss around [bitcoin’s] block-size debate.”Meanwhile, University College London postdoctoral researcher Shehar Bano has also been researching the scaling/decentralization conundrum, but as it relates to each particular blockchain’s consensus protocol.In a paper titled “Systemization of Knowledge,” Bano aggregates a number of different consensus protocols, including proof-of-work (which bitcoin uses) and proof-of-stake, and compares them, in order to figure out where development is wanting.“Researchers can then look at it and think, ‘Oh, I can contribute here,’ or ‘Oh, here’s a gap,'” Bano said.Despite the sprawling scope of the paper, decentralization was one of the main trade-offs Bano mentioned in conversation with CoinDesk.“Because what shows up in some blockchains is that, while the system is decentralized, somehow due to the governance structures or the nature of the protocol, centralization happens again,” she said. “We can see this with bitcoin mining,” where just three pools account for roughly 56 percent of the hashing power right now.Solving the problem will hinge on developing better consensus protocols, Bano argued, concluding:“The other features are really the icing on top of the cake. Consensus protocols are the cake.”Conflict image via Shutterstock"

Both countries are known as business-friendly tax havens.In Peled’s eyes, the ITA is taking steps to legitimize the business of companies financed by ICOs, in an effort to make the country just as attractive. (The ITA did not respond to request for comment from CoinDesk delivered through a third party.)CoinDash, Matchpool and Kik, all of whose teams fully or partly work in Israel, have moved their bases outside the country. Plus, Sirin Labs, which raised $157 million in an ICO recently, is largely based in Tel Aviv, but its website shows a company address in Switzerland.One of the main reasons the ITA’s circular might be appealing to token issuers is that it describes deferrals on when ICO income would become taxable, plus it mentions the potential for crypto companies to earn special tax treatment.As such, according to Peled, the industry will see more companies officially operating from Israel this year, although he declined to give any specific names. One of his startups, a consultancy called CoinTree, is encouraging clients to consider an Israeli address.Pointing to what he sees as an advantage to working in a country that is trying to move cryptocurrency out of a gray area, Peled told CoinDesk:“The goal of the blockchain industry in Israel is not to stay under the radar. It’s always been clear to us that there will be regulations and we want to work with government to help create regulations that are good for both sides.”Global consulting giant Deloitte helped the ITA craft the circular, providing extensive feedback by invitation, according to Yitzchak Chikorel of Deloitte’s international taxation team.Chikorel and others were able to convince the authority that drawing distinctions between different crypto tokens – whether it be the original currency tokens, such as bitcoin; crypto tokens created to fund the building of a platform that the coins will be used to access in the future; or crypto tokens that act as equity – would be key to writing successful regulation.“The main focus is the utility coins which are also in the heart of the tax circular,” Chikorel told CoinDesk. “Our main focus was to tie a direct and clear line between the technology to the tokens, arguing they are connected one to each other in an inseparable tie.”Plus, the circular makes it clear that income will not automatically be taxed when it is first received.Chikorel likened this to a gift card purchase – in many places around the world, income from a gift card purchase doesn’t become taxable until someone spends the amount on the gift card, and the company can actually determine how much profit it realized.Similarly, as people start to spend the tokens bought in an ICO to purchase items on a new platform, the company will then calculate how much profit it made after it built the software and acquired customers.The circular also acknowledges that blockchain-based companies could apply for further tax advantages under Israel’s Encouragement of Capital Investment Law, which was broadly designed to attract and retain high-tech companies.Chikorel said he’s pretty confident such applications would be accepted, telling CoinDesk:“The ITA has realized the magnitude and the importance of the blockchain as an evolutionary technology that could allow the creation of the next generation of multinational companies.”Having said that, others aren’t so sure that tax laws will persuade Israeli companies to bring their ICO income home.First of all, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs, mirroring some of the anti-establishment sentiment of the industry as a whole, have not typically viewed regulatory actions as comforting, even though many say these kinds of moves legitimize the industry.“Currently, I’m unaware of any Israeli company who did, or plans to do, an ICO under Israeli jurisdiction,” said Lior Jaffe, co-founder of Jelurida, the Israeli startup behind blockchain platforms Nxt and Ardor. “And these regulations, if accepted, pretty much ensure that this will stay this way.”Secondly, taxes are just part of the regulatory landscape, and the Israel Securities Authority (ISA), which regulates securities in the country, has yet to formally rule on how ICO tokens should be categorized. However, in September, it established a committee to look into the actions taken by other securities regulators around the world and decide on whether it should consider ICOs part of its purview.Not many countries’ securities regulators have set hard-and-fast definitions for ICO tokens. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman has stated that most projects he’s reviewed appear to be securities, and has moved to prosecute several ICO founders. Russia has been more decisive and China outright banned ICOs.Possibly hinting at tighter rules, the head of the ISA, Shmuel Hauser, said the regulator will seek to ban any company that has major involvement in bitcoin trading from listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).Yet, as a small country lacking a global financial hub (like London or New York), Jaffe argued, Israel should go out of its way to keep its domestic high-tech companies local.“The only practical way to achieve this is to announce that all revenues from ICOs are considered an investment and therefore exempt from taxes for a period of several years,” he contended, adding:“I think the state of Israeli is missing out on a huge opportunity to become a crypto-friendly jurisdiction.”Jaffa and Tel Aviv image via Shutterstock"

This process is slow, expensive and involves substantial counterparty risk.Fundamentally, there are two types of chain interoperability:A number of high-profile projects such as Polkadot and Cosmos are vying to be the meta “blockchain of blockchains.” Each of these systems has a native staking token that validators must stake in order to perform work for their respective networks.Another chain of chains, Block Collider, proposes a radically different technical mechanism to achieve many of the same functions.Building on insights drawn from Vitalik Buterin’s excellent paper on chain interoperability, I’ll walk through both of the functions above and highlight that the largest opportunity for these systems is message relaying. Cross-chain atomic swaps can be accomplished trustlessly without dedicated chain of chain systems.Cross-chain messaging is fundamentally a question of trust: How does one design a system to trustlessly relay messages between chains?This is especially difficult given what I’ll refer to as orphan chain risk: if a service relays the state of Chain A to Chain B, but it turns out that the relayer was on a fork of Chain A that is ultimately orphaned (either benignly or maliciously), then the relayed message to Chain B is invalid.If one is relaying messages to issue synthetic tokens across chains, this would result in cross-chain double spends, which is unacceptable. Accommodating the perpetual “what if the relayer is on an orphaned fork” risk is by far the greatest challenge in message-relaying systems.Cosmos and Polkadot address the orphaned-chain problem through two mechanisms. First, using the inter-blockchain communication (IBC) protocol, they store Merkle-ized block headers for each cross-chain transaction. Building on a history of Merkle-ized block headers, Cosmos/Polkadot maintain global invariant balances of the total supply of each token. Together these mechanisms prevent cross-chain double spends.It would be nice if systems such as Oraclize could relay messages between chains. But these kinds of systems don’t account for the orphaned chain problem.If we look out into the future, it’s possible to envision a time in which the orphaned chain problem is solved by the sending chain itself. How? By leveraging finality in proof-of-stake (PoS) based systems. This is the explicit purpose of Casper FFG, which is in alpha now. However, it’s unclear how fast finality can be given tradeoffs in parametrizing such a PoS system.Even with a finality guarantee, there are still other challenges.We’re currently witnessing a Cambrian explosion of blockchain innovation. This is likely to continue for the next few years at a minimum. Given the number of new chains that are emerging, each chain will be required to store and validate Merkle-ized block headers of every other chain with which it communicates.Each blockchain could become bloated with blockheaders of every other chain. Using a bridge chain reduces the bloat per chain from a function of n! to to a function of n.While I’d like to see a future in which blockchains communicate directly with one another without an intermediary chain, this seems highly unlikely. This problem is compounded by the fact that systems such as bitcoin may never move off of proof-of-work (PoW) consensus and towards PoS consensus with guaranteed finality.If you project out far enough, it seems possible that intermediary chains will become superfluous, but that future is still unclear. For the foreseeable future – at least a few years – Cosmos/Polkadot have a real opportunity to become the backbone powering cross-chain messaging.The first cross-chain atomic swap recently occurred between Litecoin and Decred.These are both chains that don’t support Turing-complete programming languages. Cross-chain atomic swaps will be technically easier to implement between general-purpose smart contract platforms. It will take another one or two years for these libraries to mature and become widely adopted, but they will. There aren’t many technical questions remaining.The other major challenge with cross-chain atomic swaps is price discovery and order matching. That’s where decentralized exchanges (DEX) such as 0x and OmiseGo come into play. OmiseGo is fully decentralized, meaning that the order book lives on chain.In 0x, orders are hosted by relayers (centralized entities), who then submit matched orders to the chain for settlement.If the market ultimately demands DEXs to be fully decentralized – including on-chain order books – then systems like OmiseGo will be necessary for cross-chain atomic swaps to function. However, given the intrinsic limitations of on-chain order books (settlement time, miner front-running, miner griefing, etc), I believe that the 0x model will prevail for the foreseeable future.Although 0x only works within the ethereum ecosystem today, the 0x roadmap includes cross-chain* support (it will likely leverage much of the tech built in the Litecoin-Decred proof of concept for Scrypt based chains). 0x relayers will host order books for price discovery, and will relay messages between chains to trigger the release of funds from the escrow on each chain. This should offer many of the best elements of decentralization (no counterparty risk) and centralization (speed, order matching), with minimal trust guarantees (only that the relayer actually relays the messages to both chains).On-chain DEXs are theoretically possible.However, given the limitations they face, the intrinsic network effects of liquidity in order books, time-to-market and go-to-market advantages, and minimal trust guarantees of a 0x relayer, I contend that the 0x model will prevail, leaving little opportunity** for Cosmos/Polkadot/Block Collider-based DEXs.With the Cosmos launch approaching in the next month or two, we’re about to witness a huge hype cycle about the opportunity for an internet of blockchains. Systems like Cosmos solve fundamental cross-chain communication problems, but aren’t necessarily the answer to all cross-chain communication challenges.It’s paramount to recognize that not everything these systems can do actually needs to be done by a chain of chains. As the crypto ecosystem evolves, expect more diversity in trust models, relayers, and solutions broadly.* Note: Cross-chain atomic swaps are only possible if both chains offer a native escrow function. This requires bitcoin-esque script functions at a minimum. Some chains, such as IOTA and sia, for example, don’t support on-chain trustless escrows at all, and as such cannot implement trustless cross-chain atomic swaps.** One of the greatest limitations of cross-chain atomic swaps is settlement time. By definition, these transactions can only settle as fast as the block time of the slower of the two chains. Block Collider’s system allows for settlements that are theoretically even faster than the block times of either chain. Enabling cross-chain swaps to settle more quickly than the block times of either chain is a pretty wild idea. Given how slow bitcoin blocks are, Block Collider could carve out an interesting niche.Special thanks to the Sunny Aggarwal, Matt Luongo, James Prestwich, and Sina Habibian for their input on this essay.Chain connection image via Shutterstock"

currency.","Jan 28, 2018 at 09:11 UTC",Dr. Pavel Kravchenko holds a PhD in technical sciences and is the founder of Distributed Lab.,"For many years, people used to believe that the Earth consisted of an amalgam of four elements – earth, fire, water and air. It took until nearly 1750 for scientists to realize that fire isn’t an element, but the result of a process.Later, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev unveiled his Periodic Table of Elements, which showed which chemical elements could actually exist, including those not present here on Earth. Mendeleev’s work led to a purposeful search and a synthesis of elements, resulting in breakthroughs in many different industries.There’s a feeling that people today are doing the same with digital assets – naming them as traditional cryptocurrencies, ICO tokens, utility tokens etc. This leads to the confusion for the media and the wider crowd.They start to believe that everything containing crypto – or token – is magic and possesses some kind of new features and monetary model. Regulators are the last to catch up, sometimes allowing everything that looks innovative, without deep analysis of the matter.Defining some criteria of digital asset classification will move forward the whole industry and simplify the job of investors and regulators.A digital asset is anything that exists in binary format, and comes with the right to use it.Digital assets are scarce – meaning that at any particular moment of time there can be only one defined owner (or group of owners) of the asset.A token is an accounting unit that represents its owner’s balance in a designated asset.There are five processes in a digital accounting system, which may have at least three states (centralized, decentralized, not possible), and which can be managed by one or separate roles:Different combinations of the ways these processes are managed lead to the different types of digital assets (which we call the distributed periodic table).These are the most common for now or established terms.CryptocurrencyA network that performs the issuance and initial distribution of a currency, in addition to processing transactions in a decentralized way, using a secure, provable mathematical algorithm.All five processes are managed by this algorithm, which is run independently by each participant. The key property of a cryptocurrency is the level of decentralization (the number of participants, and the correlation between their decisions).Another important property is permissionless participation, which requires a censorship-free system.The extreme conditions for cryptocurrency are:Good examples are proof-of-work-based currencies such as bitcoin and monero.Central bank currencyA system with all five processes centralized and managed by a central bank, in which digital currency is pegged to a national currency on a 1:1 ratio.Digital currencyIn some systems, processes such as validation of transactions, fee set-up and updates can be handled by the decentralized network of users – while currency issuance and initial distribution is managed by a centralized organization.Custody is not applicable, because there is no collateral at all.Good examples are Ripple, Stellar, IOTA.Commodity-backed tokensA commodity is an item produced to satisfy wants or needs. Commodity-backed tokens represent ownership rights in a particular amount of a commodity. Tokens are managed in a system with centralized governance, custody and issuance. These processes are performed by a service provider, or by the custodian of a physical commodity.One token is always backed by a fixed quantity of the commodity, and the 1:1 ratio is guaranteed by a designated party.Examples are the U.S. dollar prior to 1971, a token which represented gold, or warehouse receipts – in these cases, processing and audit is done in a centralized way too.An example from the crypto world would be Tether, whose processing is decentralized.Equity tokensA security is a fungible financial instrument that represents some type of financial value.Equity represents ownership in a company or participation in its revenue stream. Security tokens represent ownership of an underlying security, or a share in a cash flow generated by the system.Tokens are managed in a system with centralized governance, custody and issuance. These processes are performed by a depository, or by a company itself. One token always represents a certain number of shares, or a percentage of cash flow. Processing can be done in a centralized way by a depository.An example from the crypto world would be DAO tokens, whose processing is decentralized.Accounting tokensAccounting tokens represent something that makes sense to account, yet doesn’t make sense to transfer.Governance, issuance, custody and audit are centralized. Identity, reputation, and ratings are examples of such assets.Web-of-trust identities belong to this category, although in that case issuance, custody and audit are decentralized.Digital collectiblesA collectible is any object regarded as being of value or interest to a collector.These objects are unique and non-fungible. Token represents ownership of a particular object. Governance and issuance are centralized.CryptoKitties are examples of such assets.Utility tokensUtility is a quality of an object’s usefulness. Utility tokens represent the right to use system functionality. The role of utility tokens is to make system usage simpler than it was without them, which is true under certain conditions.Utility tokens provide several functions – as internal currency, accumulation of system’s value, or accounting. In the long run, utility tokens have to fragment into divisions – digital currency, security tokens, accounting tokens. Governance and issuance are centralized.Here are some questions to ask to figure out which category a token belongs in:Prior to the emergence of bitcoin, it was believed that all the five processes could only be handled in a centralized way.Bitcoin, however, showed that it was perfectly possible to set up decentralized financial systems.When we said that each process can be executed in three ways (centralized, decentralized, or process is not possible), the outcome is that there are hundreds of possible combinations.Let’s explore some of them:We are on the edge of a major breakthrough when we will see new new business models and application of tokenization. They will become possible due to technological improvements of cryptographic tools (efficient homomorphic encryption, short and fast zero-knowledge proofs, secure multi-party computation, quantum computing), mesh networks, networking infrastructure, etc.These new business models will largely rely on new synthesized types of assets and will entail significant economic and social shifts. It’s important to have a precise vocabulary to make sense of it all.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple and Zcash Company, the for-profit entity that develops the zcash protocol.Periodic table image via Shutterstock"

The suit explained how only a few of the account holders had received their funds after the exchange froze all withdrawals due to a claimed lack of reserves. At present, the frozen accounts contain a combined $50 million.The exchange has allowed customers to deposit funds over the past four years, and continues to operate today, according to the lawsuit.In 2014, the exchange reported it was near insolvency after losing large amounts of its reserve funds. According to the lawsuit, part of this loss came from “two purported hacks the exchange experienced in mid-2013.” Yet more of its reserve funds were depleted by large withdrawals by some of its customers.As a result, the Vircurex froze withdrawals of bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin and terracoin. At the time, the company stated it would begin refunding users using its own profits, according to as previously reported by CoinDesk.The filing claims the exchange refunded small amounts of cryptocurrencies to a few of its customers, but the bulk of the funds owed remain with the exchange. The last time the exchange transferred any funds to its customers was in January 2016.Furthermore, the plaintiff, Timothy Shaw, claimed that the exchange was refusing to speak to its customers, despite several customers making attempts to contact the exchange over the past four years.The suit continued:“As detailed herein, rather than repay the Frozen Funds, Defendants took steps to string along Plaintiff and the Class with deceptive statements and false promises, and made efforts to cover their tracks and create impediments designed to deter accountholders from bringing suit to recover the Frozen Funds, and efforts to ultimately attempt to vanish without a trace.”Vircurex’s steps to prevent its customers from suing included stating it was incorporated in Belize, which it is not, as well as indicating it might be based in Beijing. The lawsuit states the exchange is actually based out of Germany, but has never been legally incorporated in any jurisdiction, meaning it is not recognized as a formal business by any government.In addition to the exchange itself, the lawsuit names its two operators as defendants, identifying one as Andreas Eckert and referring to the other as “John or Jane Doe.”Requests for comment to Shaw’s lawyers and Vircurex were not immediately returned.Vircurex Class Action by CoinDesk on ScribdGavel image via Shutterstock"

cheaper payment rails as ethereum, like bitcoin, struggles to scale.","Jan 25, 2018 at 14:00 UTC",“We look at ethereum like AOL or Myspace.”,"That’s how Mobius Network co-founder and CEO David Gobaud explains why his startup ran its initial coin offering (ICO) on the Stellar network instead of ethereum, the most popular blockchain for token sales.The comment underscores the growing interest in some corners of the crypto community for faster and cheaper payment rails as ethereum, like bitcoin, struggles to scale.Mobius announced Thursday that it has raised $39 million in the ICO — one of the larger recent token sales and the largest by far on the Stellar platform. The company accepted only Stellar’s native currency, lumens (XLM), in exchange for its own token, known as mobi.According to Mobius, the sale hit its $39 million hard cap after only two hours, selling 35 percent of the total 888 million mobi tokens.Participants in the round included China’s Angel Chain Capital, Nirvana Capital and WaltonChain, an internet of things (IoT) startup that is building devices to enable manufacturers and retailers to track supply chains, according to the firm’s website.In addition to this backing, Gobaud emphasized that Mobius deployed its decentralized app (dapp) store alongside its ICO, saying it was important for the company to come out with live code early, to prove the project was real.But what’s perhaps most striking about the sale was the choice of blockchain.While latency or cost might not be a dealbreaker for some blockchain projects, they are for Mobius’ use case. Its thesis is that traditional tech companies will soon want to integrate with cryptocurrencies and, eventually, a decentralized web.Mobius’ white paper compares the company’s work to that of Stripe, the Silicon Valley darling that took integration of credit card payments down to a few lines of code (and incubated Stellar in its early days). Mobius aims to do the same thing for cryptocurrency payments and, down the line, for publishing data to trade on decentralized marketplaces.So the company needed an IoT-friendly network that could handle large amounts of transactions and data quickly, with low or no fees.The goal is to “make it easy to connect every device, developer and data stream to the blockchain ecosystem,” Gobaud said.Yet while the vast majority of ICO-funded projects have been run on top of ethereum, using the ERC-20 standard, that blockchain has suffered from transaction backlogs and pendulum-like swings in fees.Hence, after beginning its project on ethereum, Mobius switched to Stellar, the protocol created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb. Like Ripple before it, Stellar was designed specifically for frictionless payments.Ethereum’s scaling challenges have become acute in recent months. The issue moved Kik to announce that it would move its kin token off ethereum in December 2017.While the ethereum developers recognize and are working on the problem, the Mobius team couldn’t wait for a scaling solution, Gobaud said.“We were building our dapp store on ethereum and then we connected with Jed,” he said adding:“We realized there was no way that ethereum could handle our technology. It was too slow, too expensive and too insecure. … We see all these other projects with these immense problems”Gobaud highlighted the problems with safely deploying smart contracts. “They are Turing complete programs, but they are really hard to write,” he said, pointing to the first and second multi-million-dollar ether losses on Parity. Solidity was not a language built with security in mind, Gobaud argued.In Stellar, “we think we’ve uncovered this underutilized, really unknown technology,” Gobaud said.For example, Stellar supports multi-signature wallets at the protocol level, making custodianship much easier for developers.But Stellar has its downsides, Gobaud acknowledged. It’s not Turing complete, for example, but Mobius is happy to make that trade-off in exchange for vastly faster and cheaper transactions.The white paper discusses a lot of use cases for the mobi token and its protocol, but the easiest one to explain is payments.For anyone who believes that cryptocurrency will become more and more appealing to online businesses, the company that makes transacting in crypto easy the fastest stands to recoup benefits with a long tail.If Mobius can make accepting crypto payments a matter of adding a few lines of code, that would be compelling if online companies begin accepting cryptocurrency more widely.Talking to Gobaud, though, payments seems more like a way to sell the traditional internet on blockchain integration.He’s most excited about the market that will come when firms start posting their data to decentralized marketplaces, selling it via secure, live auctions he calls the “NASDAQ for data.”Gobaud said:“More advanced or technical users are really excited about the data marketplace because they are aware that getting data into blockchain ecosystem is really complicated.”Data generated on blockchain protocols is easy to verify because they are closed environments. But data from the real world can’t be verified on a blockchain without help.That’s why Mobius is building a proof-of-stake oracle system, so that data streams with data from the real world can build up reputations as reliable sources over time. With the system, to put its data up for sale on the market, a company would have to prove it holds a certain amount of tokens.If that marketplace catches on, the cost of staking should be more than paid for by revenue from selling data over time. This could be anything from data about road conditions from a smart vehicle or local weather from a sensor on top of a commercial building.To reach the point where the decentralized web has a rich enough ecosystem to support these marketplaces, the team is also working to solve other small problems faced by developers on the way there. For example, it built a universal login protocol, where a website can verify that a device holds a token to let its user log on to a service.Some sites might want to take this a step further and use tokens to integrate the level of access someone has to a site. So, on a platform like Reddit, a user might only need one token, while a moderator might need a few tokens to log in with more advanced permissions.In the meantime, developers are already building dapps for Mobius’ store, but it’s small scale offerings so far, little video games or prediction games. That’s work at the experimental level, but Gobaud said he’s encouraged by the fact that people already want to work with it. The websites on Geocities were crude, too, but they were a stepping stone to the web we know today.He concluded:“It’s like the early days of the internet.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple. Mobius strip image via Shutterstock"

An iOS version is slated to follow soon.With SafeWallet users can send and receive cryptocurrency assets, create multiple wallets and import wallets in a variety of formats, a release says. The app currently supports bitcoin and ether, with more cryptocurrencies to be supported soon.Cheetah Mobile, which specializes in security app products, states:“SafeWallet employs a unique three-tiered security defense system that protects users in three key areas, including user behavior, phone security and asset management to provide maximum protection for users’ digital assets and prevent them from being lost or stolen.”The company stressed that SafeWallet does not access users private key, or initiate transactions on their behalf.Edward Sun, SVP of Cheetah Mobile, said, “Similar to our AI strategy, we are committed to staying at the forefront of the latest technological trends, and mobile asset security is an area that we believe we can have a strong impact.”Cheetah Mobile already provides mobile security products such as Clean Master and Security Master, and currently claims that more than 100 million customers use its products daily.The move comes as other mobile app makers seek to tap into the popularity of cryptocurrencies.Just yesterday, CoinDesk reported that both Square and Line Corporation are adding cryptocurrency options and services to their current payment apps.Messaging app Kik has even gone so far as to launch its own crypto token, called “kin,” aimed to power its ecosystem, as well as raise funds for the company.Mobile in hand image via Shutterstock"

The reason: the company wants to “control speculation and protect the interests of our investors.”“Please finish all your cloud mining contract trading ASAP. Thank you all for your support,” ViaBTC added.ViaBTC first launched its cloud mining service in November 2016.The closure comes months after ViaBTC shut down its cryptocurrency exchange in response to a crackdown by Chinese authorities on the country’s exchange ecosystem, a process that began in 2017. Officials also moved to prohibit the use of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September.Yet while there’s no clear indication that the two events are related, the latest announcement follows new reports that officials in China are seeking a gradual shutdown of domestic bitcoin mining operations.According to documents circulated over the weekend and attributed to the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation, a Chinese regulator, officials want to curb support for local miners, calling for measures around power and land use. One of the documents requested that officials prepare plans for such a process by the 10th.A representative from the agency’s Xinjiang office confirmed the documentation’s veracity to Quartz but declined to comment further.As further illustrated by Bloomberg, miners in China are shifting their footprint away from the country, eyeing new locations in Europe and North America.

bitcoin expert” ads in their Facebook feed?) The problem is that ...","Jan 22, 2018 at 13:00 UTC",Michael J. Casey is chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor of blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.,"Mark Zuckerberg, worth $71 billion at just 33, has done rather well by Facebook’s centrally managed system.Over the past decade and a half, the social media behemoth’s closed-source algorithm has quietly manipulated its millions of users’ news feeds to capture maximum ad dollars and steer them all to Zuck and his shareholders.So, why is he exploring a more decentralized model?  And what role might crypto technology play in that?In a New Year’s post to the platform, the Facebook CEO noted (with zero irony, it seems) that“With the rise of a small number of big tech companies … many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it.”And he vowed, on that basis, “to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects” of decentralizing, people-empowering technologies such as cryptocurrencies and encryption.It was followed by another post telling users that upcoming changes to their news feeds meant they “can expect to see more from your friends, family and groups” and “less public content like posts from businesses, brands, and media.”It remains to be seen whether this bet in favor of “meaningful social interactions” over higher traffic content is, as Zuckerberg said, “good for our community and our business over the long term.” The immediate reaction on Wall Street was harsh: Facebook’s shares fell 4.5 percent last Friday following the second post.It was a predictable response: if Facebook will no longer curate new feeds to emphasize strong, ad-attracting content, then revenues, and returns to shareholders, will decline.So, why’d Zuck do it?The prevailing wisdom is he wants Washington off his back.The Russian political investigation has shone a light on how Facebook uses its proprietary, closed-source algorithm, the core instrument of its centralized power, to deliberately package “like audiences” for advertisers.More important than allegations that Russian operatives used Facebook to spread disinformation and influence U.S. elections is the fact that Facebook has become so powerful a force that this kind of meddling is possible.What’s more, its algorithm effectively encourages it, if unwittingly: it naturally creates echo chambers of commonly minded people who will happily re-share and redistribute content they agree with, creating a sticky audience to sell to advertisers.This happens even, or perhaps especially, when the stories they are sharing are  demonstrably fake.But Zuckerberg is clearly also bothered by rising disaffection among his users, a group to whom cyber security guru Bruce Schneier once offered this warning: “Don’t make the mistake of thinking you’re Facebook’s customer, you’re not – you’re the product.”It took a while, but many now understand the bum deal they’re getting: they produce and distribute the content that drives traffic on the site, as well as delivering attention to advertisers, but aren’t compensated one penny for it.To make matters worse, they’re forced to look at content they don’t want to see. (Who else is in the crypto community is sick of James Altucher’s “eccentric bitcoin expert” ads in their Facebook feed?)The problem is that under the current business model, the more Facebook decentralizes – either by being less interventionist in news feed curation or by following YouTube’s lead and sharing ad revenue with traffic-driving users – shareholders will either get a smaller pie or a smaller piece of it, or both.On the other hand, if user discontent leads to attrition or even an all-out exodus, it matters not that shareholders are protecting their margins – advertisers will leave, revenues will slide and, eventually, the platform could die.The rise and fall of MySpace, the once ubiquitous platform that Facebook displaced, is a reminder that the latter’s dominance is not guaranteed.The resolution of this dilemma may lay with the very technology Zuckerberg has vowed to explore: a crypto-token, call it FBCoin.To be clear, I have no inside knowledge on Facebook’s plans. This is pure speculation. But, given the company’s past forays, later abandoned, into digital money and payments, I think it’s worth speculating on, especially with the context the CEO has laid out.It also offers a window into how the center of gravity might move from tokens produced by decentralized app producers to those of established enterprises – for better or worse.Here’s an admittedly very rudimentary model: Facebook would pre-mine a large pool of tokens, distributing a significant number to shareholders and holding the rest in reserve to distribute to users based on some reliable metric of the traffic their original content generates. Facebook would then mandate that on-platform advertising must be paid for with those tokens. A market would then emerge, into which users could sell, giving them a way to monetize their content creation.The value of the tokens would float against the dollar, based on demand and supply.This, I believe, is how Facebook could best resolve its dilemma, giving both shareholders and users a valuable stake in the future growth of its platform under a more decentralized set of rules.Of course, crypto folks accustomed to thinking of attack models will immediately see dangers here.There are ways to game traffic data – something that Brave is trying solve with its browser and BAT token – and how does the algorithm know whether something is “original” and not just copied and pasted from someone else?Ideas for reputation tokens, proof-of-work models to disincentivize the creation of traffic-generating bot armies, and other skin-in-the game solutions will be needed to encourage honesty.And who would run this? It’s hard to imagine Facebook choosing not to control the market for its own tokens or to centrally run the ledger.Yet if it wanted to truly unpack the expansive power of network effects, opening up the tokens to a true, decentralized blockchain system and, eventually, a decentralized market could result in far more explosive growth – and, by extension, token-based returns for Facebook’s shareholders.If Zuckerberg really wants to experiment with decentralized systems, a publicly issued crypto-token would be hell of a way to do it.Personally, I would much prefer someone else creates a scalable decentralized social media solution to replace Facebook’s insidious centralized algorithm – to do to it what Facebook did to Myspace. Social media badly needs a model that puts control back in the hands of people.But who knows? Maybe Mark Zuckerberg, who has vowed to give virtually  all his wealth away to charity, will recognize that perhaps the most powerful gift he can make to the world is a platform for creativity that empowers people by fairly rewarding their ideas and self expression.Mark Zuckerberg image via Shutterstock"

“Finney,” after computer scientist and bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney.","Jan 12, 2018 at 13:00 UTC",Does the world really need a blockchain phone?,"Sirin Labs is betting it does. The startup, which recently raised $157 million in an initial coin offering (ICO), is building an Android smartphone from scratch with special features for cryptocurrency enthusiasts: an app store for distributed apps (dapps), cold storage for private keys and easy conversion between tokens.The Switzerland-based company says the product will fill a need in a fast-growing market: a secure device that can simplify the use of cryptocurrency across multiple applications. But as an old tech adage goes, “hardware is hard,” and in blockchain it may be even harder, since devices must be engineered to protect not only information but unrecoverable money.In a nod to the device’s target audience, Sirin has dubbed the phone “Finney,” after computer scientist and bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney. Estimating this audience’s growth over the years, Sirin Labs CEO Moshe Hogeg told CoinDesk:“You have more than 10 million people that are all in crypto in one way or another. I think the community will at least double in size by the end of this year.”The phone is expected to retail just shy of $1,000, putting it in the high-end range with the likes of Apple’s iPhone. And it can only be purchased using Sirin’s crypto token (based on the ERC-20 standard). The firm sold 40 percent of the 573 million total tokens it created during the recent ICO.As an Android device, the phone will include all the usual applications, including the full Google Play store. As Hogeg explained, “We’re talking about user experience. If you don’t have Facebook then forget about it.”But what makes Finney different is that sirin tokens will also be stored on the device to facilitate payments for a wide variety of dapps.The decentralized app store on the Finney phone will provide users with access to a whole host of dapps – the products of a host of blockchain-based projects that have issued tokens via ICOs.These could include blockchain-based alternatives to popular tech companies such as Uber, which Hogeg said would be better for users by connecting providers directly to customers, reflecting the industry ethos.As such, the Finney would provide a one-stop shop for crypto enthusiasts to browse through dapps and spend their crypto on products and services. And through a partnership with Bancor, the decentralized liquidity market that raised $150 million last June in an ICO, Sirin’s software will convert users’ sirin tokens to whatever cryptocurrency is needed for a particular transaction.“A user shouldn’t care about technology. He shouldn’t care about how things work. He should care about the value of them,” said Hogeg. Hence, “the experience should be simple.”Simplicity will be a prerequisite for these token-based platforms to gain traction, he said.“If we want those technologies to become mainstream, we have to fix this issue of multiple tokens,” Hogeg said. “Our software is going to allow the user to seamlessly convert between different tokens within our phones.”Sirin faces some competition in the decentralized app store arena. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstong is also working on a browser for dapps called Toshi.In a recent Medium post, Armstrong similarly talked about the need for one platform for consumers to manage dapps. Yet, while Coinbase’s solution wouldn’t need specialized hardware, Hogeg said he believes that by the time these decentralized marketplaces are ready, early adopters will want a distinct device to safely store the cryptocurrency they’ll use.And while it’s proven to be difficult to get developers to switch from the two marketplaces currently dominating mobile (the Apple store and the Google Play store) to a new development platform, Hogeg said he has a way to convince them.“We raised enough money to incentivize a community of developers,” he said.But while Hogeg has a plan for incentivizing developers, the harder part might be luring consumers to purchase the pricey device.But he says that for crypto users, the phone’s security features will be hard to resist. Not only does the Finney phone use behavioral monitoring to detect possible exploitation, it also allows for multiple types of biometric identification and comes with cybersecurity protection from the operating system through the application layer, according to Sirin.All of these features, Hogeg admitted, can be found in one form or another on other devices, but there’s one feature on the phone that stands out: cold storage.The Finney phone allows users to disconnect their cryptocurrency’s private keys from the rest of the device and from the internet, Sirin says. This provides added protection since hackers would have to physically go to the phone’s storage vault where the private keys are held to get access.Hogeg told CoinDesk:“I think it will differentiate us. I think it’s unique, and it will grow.”But Peter Todd, a prominent cryptography consultant and bitcoin developer, was skeptical about the effectiveness of cold storage in this context, telling CoinDesk, “Why does that protect you? You need to connect to the internal electronics to accomplish anything anyway, at which point the attack can happen.”Still, a spokesperson for Sirin contended cold storage still reduces risk, which is why people use crypto-wallets like Trezor and Ledger. He explained, “We do all the signature ‘foreplay’ in advance of the actual signature” – that is, making the connection as brief as possible. “This is a well known cyber security methodology of decreasing the attack surface and time exposure,” he wrote.Further, even Hogeg acknowledges that security doesn’t sell hardware. So Sirin is also setting up the devices to be able to cooperate and share resources, for instance, in a way that allows strangers can pay each other in microtransactions for borrowing computing power or bandwidth.Yet that raises another issue. In Sirin’s whitepaper, these services lean heavily on the “Tangle,” a technology pioneered by the distributed ledger startup IOTA.Pitched as a solution tailor-made for the internet of things, IOTA requires devices to make a few proof-of-work computations in order to participate in the chain, rather than pay a fee to miners as with bitcoin.“This is how we allow it to be fee-less,” Hogeg said.Yet, IOTA and its technology have been a flashpoint of controversy since over-the-counter trading of its cryptocurrency began in 2016. For instance, MIT Media Lab actually disputed the claims in an MIT Technology Review article describing the security of IOTA.Further, the lab’s Digital Currency Initiative found a serious security flaw in Iota in September. The IOTA Foundation acknowledged the researchers’ work, while arguing that it did not represent a realistic attack and said it has always planned to submit its final cryptographic design, once ready, to academic review in order to insure its solidity.Val A. Red, a security researcher with experience in IoT systems, told CoinDesk that any blockchain-based application raises issues.“If I were looking at this outside of cryptocurrencies and from the perspective of a secure mobile or BYOD [bring-your-own-device] network administrator, I would also have reasonable concerns looking at a proposal involving interoperability with IOTA or any digital ledger technology in production.”Hogeg didn’t dispute that there are doubts about the protocol at present, but said, “Maybe we’re going to change to a different fee-less network, and there are a bunch who are talking about it. Probably it’s going to be IOTA.”Although he continued, “We are not going to announce 100 percent it is IOTA until we are 100 percent satisfied.”Hogeg confirmed that IOTA is not an investor in Sirin.But even with the Finney project’s blockchain architecture still up in the air, Hogeg is confident the phone will be released by the end of this year.And, he said, prototypes of the device should be available soon at retail stores the company plans to open in cities around the world, where people will be able to pre-order phones and talk to staff about its structure. That may sound expensive, but remember that Sirin raised $157 million in its token sale, triple what it initially estimated it would need to develop the phone.Also in the works is a Finney PC, based on the Android OS.If this all sounds overambitious, it’s worth noting that Hogeg has been effective at generating chatter around his projects. In 2014, he created the joke app Yo, a messaging app that initially only allowed users to send the single word “yo” back and forth. Around the same time, he snagged backing from Leonardo DiCaprio, Lance Armstrong and Serena Williams for his short-form video service, Mobli.At Sirin, he has already had some success in manufacturing mobile devices, building a privacy-oriented Android phone called Solarin, which came with a $13,800 retail price tag.Still, his projects have also not matured without some stumbling blocks. In 2016, even though it had some real traction, Mobli was shut down, and in early 2017, Sirin laid off 30 percent of its staff after sales of the Solarin phone failed to support the business model (they are still sold, though).But according to Hogeg, the way in which the software for Finney was built, allowing other Android manufacturers to use it in their devices as well, hedges the company’s bet on building a piece of hardware from the ground up.Addressing the uncertainty of the business, but also his optimism going forward, Hogeg concluded:“Could be that we will become a very big phone manufacturer. Could be. Could be, also, that phone manufacturers will use our software … and we give them everything we do for free, as long as they use our token as the engine for everything.”Smartphone interior image via Shutterstock."

The [software] is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted.”That phrase is a stand-in for the more commonly used term “mining”, or the energy-intensive process by which new transactions are added to a blockchain. Nvidia’s graphics card products – along with those from rival chip maker AMD – have been highly sought by miners in recent months, as previously reported.The boost in demand has been significant for chip manufacturers, with Nvidia, in particular, posting $2.23 billion in revenue after the second quarter in 2017. That marked a 56% jump from the previous year, with the company seeing $280 million more in profits than was projected during that time period.Without permission from the manufacturer, companies must use Nvidia’s more expensive enterprise-level products for other data center applications like running artificial intelligence tests. The price gap is significant – while a GeForce card is in the $700s range, the enterprise-level product, the Tesla V100, runs for just under $10,000.According to The Register, a Nvidia spokesperson pointed out that the GeForce and Titan GPUs were designed for individual customers, not for large companies to use in a constantly-operating data center.GeForce chip image via Rugged Studio / Shutterstock"

The app will also provide a digital wallet, a personal finance manager and help aid person-to-person payments.A Santander spokesperson said the company plans to launch the app in the next few months, and that it will use Ripple’s xCurrent in the project.Ripple’s xCurrent product does not use XRP, the company’s native cryptocurrency.Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse announced the move to his followers on Twitter, noting that the app will be released this quarter.Separately, Ripple spent about $84 million of XRP from its nearly $1 billion January reserve last month, according to current market prices.The company had access to 1 billion XRP last month, meaning the remaining 900 million went back into escrow at the end of January. The funds were transferred back through two transactions, with the 900 million XRP holding a value of $756 million at press time.The company has 61 billion XRP valued at $51 billion locked up in escrow over the next four years through a series of smart contracts.Ripple’s escrow movement was developed as a way to increase trust in XRP. Due to Ripple’s own holdings, limiting access to the tokens from even the developers prevented massive token dumps which could tank the price.Each month, 1 billion XRP is released to the company for internal use. While in the past, Ripple used on average some 300 million XRP per month, it appears to be requiring fewer of its reserve tokens, at least according to this one data point.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple. Santander UK image via Jason Batterham / Shutterstock"

We will accept BTC, Eth, possibly some other currencies. [That’s] to be determined.”Cuban is a backer of industry firms such as crypto-asset investment fund 1confirmation, and Unikrn, an e-sports company within the “Shark Tank” VC’s portfolio, recently held an initial coin offering that ultimately raised $31 million.Though he didn’t offer any specifics, Cuban suggested that the Mavericks’ crypto-payments system could, when launched, offer support for other tokens as well beyond the more well-known cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.“We will also look at accepting tokens from companies we have traditional business relationships with as a way to expand our customer base,” he told CoinDesk.Michael del Castillo contributed reporting.Image Credit: dean bertoncelj / Shutterstock.com"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 19, 2018 at 05:11 UTC",Initial coin offerings (ICOs) are evolving into an industry unto themselves.,"As in any growing business, you can tell this is happening when new third-party providers crop up with ever-more specialized services.In the ICO industry, that’s the handful of platforms that have recently launched to support token issuers throughout the life of their sales – providing investor verification, receiving and managing money, securing funds and distributing the tokens (or simple agreements for future tokens, also called SAFTs) on issuers’ behalf.In this way, the issuers themselves can focus on building their products without worrying about all the little details of the actual sale.The new vendors represent the first wave of ICO platforms in a market that will no doubt continue to evolve, with these providers increasingly specializing into niches.Just as the very structure of ICOs themselves is an ongoing conversation – for instance, Blockstack prioritized broad reach with its token sale, skipping the private presale altogether, whereas the Sliver.TV ICO of “theta” only had a private sale, canceling its public sale after it hit its hard cap – these platforms for launching token sales are also emphasizing different aspects of the sale process.And while potential ICO investors are wading through white papers and scrutinizing tech teams and advisers to vet token projects, which platforms an ICO launches on is yet another mechanism for understanding what a token project is all about. Several of these platforms provide vetting before partnering with a project for example, while others are more eager to host as many projects as they can.Call it re-intermediation if you like, a reinvention of investment banking for the crypto age, or simply a new business model with no apples-to-apples precedent. Here’s a look at some of the companies taking the busywork out of running an ICO.Launched last May as a collaboration between Protocol Labs and AngelList, a platform for connecting early-stage startups with investors, CoinList aims to be “the gold standard” platform for token offerings.Late last year, CoinList parted with AngelList – whose founder, Naval Ravikant, is an influencer in the blockchain space – became a standalone company, and since then CEO Andy Bromberg has positioned it as a place only for the “best of the best token sales.”To do so, the company examines not only ICO project’s technical work, but also the token economics underpinning the system.So far, only three projects have issued tokens through its platform, but these have been among some of the most widely-anticipated sales in the industry: Protocol Lab’s Filecoin SAFTs, Blockstack’s “stacks” and mobile video streaming provider, YouNow’s “props.”Yet, a great many other ICOs in the space have used another CoinList product – ComplyAPI, a white-label product which handles investor accreditation, know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering compliance for ICOs.Another AngelList spin-off, Republic occupies a unique area of the industry.Launched in July 2016 as a traditional equity crowdfunding platform after the Jobs Act provided ways for non-accredited investors to invest in private companies, Republic recently launched a crypto token platform, using their Token DPA (debt payable by asset) instrument, for the same purpose.For example, in December, Republic offered YouNow’s “props” and facilitated the purchase of $1.07 million worth of the token in YouNow’s larger token sale.While the company gives access to those enthusiasts that would otherwise be constrained from participating in certain token sales, the platform isn’t suited to run a complete ICO (most of the fundraising an ICO does would have to be on another platform).Still, in its infancy, the “props” sale is the only one Republic has facilitated so far, but Republic CEO Kendrick Nguyen told CoinDesk more are soon to come.He continued:“We’re highly selective and choose to work primarily with projects that already have significant traction and/or have noted advisors and investors supporting their vision.”Co-founded by BitGo alum Mason Borda, TokenSoft focuses on providing assurance to the entrepreneurs launching crypto tokens with a white-label product that runs on client project sites.“Our clients can rest assured that they are adhering to their counsel’s guidance by partnering with us,” Borda told CoinDesk.The company launched in September and its platform is structured so that it can answer any question a client’s legal team might have over the course of a token sale. For example, the platform allows token issuer’s counsel to assess the language and approach to verification of terms and conditions.On September 9, the platform facilitated its first token sale for quantified biology platform Doc.ai, followed by the $5.5 million raise for cooperative ownership fund, Swarm Fund. It has four projects running on the platform now.Indiegogo is one of the oldest and best-known crowdfunding sites. Along with Republic, it’s one of the few companies on this list with non-crypto origins.The company recently announced they’d be opening up the platform to ICOs, and Indiegogo’s previous success and its existing community of people could be attractive for token issuers.According to Slava Rubin, an Indiegogo co-founder:“Token-based fundraising has enormous potential to disrupt the capital markets, but today’s landscape lacks a voice of credibility to help separate quality from quantity.”While these platforms could seem like easy targets for tweaking business models to accept crypto token sales, Indiegogo’s chief rival, Kickstarter, made it clear that it would not be facilitating the sale of crypto tokens.Indiegogo is also proceeding cautiously. The only token project it has so far facilitated is the ICO for the Fan Controlled Football League (FCFL) launched on December 12, which met its $5 million goal in ten days.Swiss company Eidoo, which launched a crypto wallet and exchange last year, announced in November that it would be facilitating ICOs through a platform called ICO Engine.While the platform is still new – with the product’s standalone website still not available – ethereum-based decentralized lending platform ETHLend finished its token sale on the platform already through the use of Eidoo’s mobile application, and augmented reality startup Ubiatar has made a commitment to use the company’s platform for its upcoming sale.Eidoo’s marketing of the platform emphasizes the amount of active crypto users it has for its wallet and exchange – the app recently hit 200,000 downloads, arguing that more users are more potential investors.Eidoo also facilitates airdrops of tokens for teams that want to use crypto to promote a product or service. But it doesn’t yet have KYC/AML compliance built into the platform, although it can integrate with existing solutions in this area.According to BlockEx CEO Adam Leonard:“Our head of capital markets says all the time, ‘If I won’t sell it to my mom, it ain’t going on the platform.”BlockEx is a very new platform for ICO issuance, but is making a name for itself by offering token issuers consulting on their white paper and token economics should the team believe the project is working on a good fundamental idea.The platform limits itself to working with issuers of utility tokens – those that give holders access to a particular service. And it insists on strong KYC, plus will require milestones before releasing funds if companies want to raise a lot of money.One of the features Leonard emphasized is its book building software, which helps a token issuer gauge interest from investors and finds a price for their offering.While BlockEx doesn’t technically “market” the token sales happening on its platform, the company does offer opportunities by organizing events and road shows where issuers can pitch their token to investors in person.The company is also running its own ICO for a token that will give investors on the platform early access to token presales.Launched this week, Cointopia built a platform for connecting ICO issuers to a long pipeline of investors.And with the support (both as advisers and investors) of co-founder of Block.one Brock Pierce, Evercoin founder Miko Matsumura and Stellar founder Jed McCaleb, the company is sure to grab some attention.The first two tokens it will be offering is the Bee token, which will back a decentralized version of Airbnb, and Cointopia’s own ICO token.According to Charles Michael Yim, Cointopia’s founder, the company’s main differentiator is its post-ICO management solution.“Companies have pain points in managing the tokens and funds post ICO, communicating to token holders, monitoring performance and most importantly driving value to the token,” Yim said.In an effort to help with that, Cointopia would like to start its own exchange, so that tokens immediately have a secondary market to be traded on.Speaking to the nascency of the industry overall, Gil Penchina, a Cointopia adviser and investor, said in a press release:“As with any new growth industry, the companies selling the ‘picks and shovels’ always win.”Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Brock Pierce is with Blockchain Capital. An earlier version of this report inaccurately indicated that the sales were limited to accredited investors.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in BitGo, Blockstack and Protocol Labs. Strategy board game image via Shutterstock"

And the company has developed its technology using the Fabric software contributed by IBM to the open-source Linux Foundation, to do just that.Yet one roadblock still remains: finding a way to sell a collaborative system to a bunch of competitors.So Denmark-based Maersk and IBM have decided that by spinning off the project into a standalone entity, they might have more success in attracting Maersk’s rivals to the solution.Announced today, the yet-to-be-named joint venture is awaiting final regulatory approval, but the idea is that a well-rounded advisory board (which is still being established) would help ensure transparency and a level playing field among participants.Unlike a typical startup situation, though, the technology behind the venture has already been widely tested, with pilot users including some of the largest companies in the world.DuPont, Dow Chemical and the food packager and processor Tetra Pak have already experimented with an early version of the platform. Plus, custom agencies in the Netherlands and U.S., and ports in Rotterdam and Houston, have all taken part as well.According to the joint venture’s CEO, Michael White, the new entity is essential given the variety of potentially competing counterparties involved.“This is not a bespoke Maersk system,” White, who was previously the president of Maersk Line in North America, told CoinDesk, adding:“This is going to be an industry-wide, open platform solution for all ecosystem participants.”Within six months of receiving regulatory approval, White expects the company to make its services available for wider use.Among those interested in using the entity’s blockchain solution are General Motors, Procter & Gamble and Agility Logistics, with additional participation from customs and government agencies from Singapore, Peru and China.Also, the global terminal operators of APM Terminals in New Jersey and PSA International in Singapore are slated to use the platform to boost collaboration between their users and improve the way they organize their terminals.According to IBM Global Industry senior vice president Bridget van Kralingen, the venture is part of a bigger effort by the supply chain ecosystem to capitalize on “untapped” resources.“Our joint venture with Maersk means we can now speed adoption of this exciting technology with the millions of organizations who play vital roles in one of the most complex and important networks in the world, the global supply chain,” she said in a statement.The spin-off is the latest development by Maersk since it completed its first live blockchain trades in May and revealed a pilot project in Singapore in August.In September, Maersk also outlined plans to deploy a maritime insurance product using blockchain.According to White, the first two services the new company will offer are being designed to provide end-to-end shipping information and to digitize and automate trade paperwork.“Being able to run a global business more efficiently is important,” White said, concluding:“The opportunity that the customers see in helping to identify and close key gaps in real-time access to events and to document availability is real.

On its website, CopyCash promotes itself as a platform for “social travesting”, or a mixture of investing and trading.“The directive was issued by the SC following its inquiry after it found that there is a reasonable likelihood that disclosures in CopyCash Foundation’s white paper and representations to potential investors will contravene relevant requirements under securities laws,” the agency said in a statement.The SC referenced CopyCash in a Jan. 5 statement on the blockchain funding model, noting at the time that it planned to meet with representatives of the CopyCash Foundation “to inquire into its activities including the purported launch of [CopyCashCoin].”That the regulator would act swiftly to issue the cease-and-desist notice is perhaps unsurprising, given moves by agencies in other parts of the world to quash ICOs ahead of their launch. SC said in its Jan. 5 statement that it had noticed an uptick of ICO promotion within Malaysia, including solicitations of elderly citizens.The SC added that it would work with other bodies, including Malaysia’s central bank, on the ICO issue.“The SC continues to work with Bank Negara Malaysia and other enforcement agencies, including our foreign counterparts, to closely monitor such activities and will take appropriate action where necessary,” the agency said at the time.Malaysia currency image via Shutterstock"

Lightning Network, recently conducted its first off-chain atomic swap ...","Jan 11, 2018 at 05:00 UTC",What if there were no exchanges to hack?,"As a new generation of crypto users begin to invest in the technology, developers are growing concerned about its infrastructure. They’ve seen this happen before – new users enter the space attracted by big gains, then suddenly, a catastrophic failure, usually at the very exchanges designed to hold and custody those funds.But out of adversity, inspiration is taking hold, with high-profile coders turning their focus to atomic swaps, a concept that claims to allow for the direct, peer-to-peer transfer of cryptocurrencies across different blockchains. In the place of the vulnerable exchanges we use today, the idea behind atomic swaps is that these large repositories of customer money could be rendered obsolete by code.And seasoned blockchain developers like Alex Bosworth believe this is all too necessary, especially given that users today need to effectively give up custody of their assets if they choose to hold funds on exchanges.He told CoinDesk:“Putting users in control of their own private keys has the best aggregate track record for security despite individual cases of loss. Funds under centralized control on exchanges have led to the most massive security failures we’ve seen.”Andrew Gazdecki, CEO and co-founder of Altcoin.io, which recently launched a beta wallet for atomic swapping between crypto tokens, describes the problem in similar terms, arguing that users should be empowered to hold their own private keys (the alphanumeric strings that allow users to unlock, access and spend their funds) without relying on others.“There are literally billions of dollars being held within these digital honeypots, and it’s nearly impossible to find the perpetrators,” he said.Early examples of atomic swaps technology emerged in various stages in 2017, and while there’s disagreement as to the timeline they’ll be available to the public, some believe 2018 will be their year.As Jameson Lopp, a BitGo software engineer, recently tweeted:“Nearly instant atomic swaps … are coming sooner than everyone thinks. Definitely not a year away, but mere months.”In some ways, atomic swaps are already here – depending on the kind of atomic swap you’re looking to make.For instance, last year saw swaps between different blockchains built on similar code – the cryptocurrencies decred, litecoin and bitcoin – executed. Meanwhile, atomic swaps between cryptocurrency tokens on the same blockchain became more commonplace, with decentralized exchanges such as 0x and, as mentioned above, Altcoin.io, adding instant trades between tokens on ethereum compatible protocols.Cryptocurrencies running on blockchains with much different codebases, though, must rely on purpose-built tools to facilitate these kinds of transfers today.Toward this goal, a tool for exchanging zcash for bitcoin called ZBXCAT was developed last year. Described by co-developer Jay Graber as the “walkie-talkie of payments,” the tool will soon be accompanied by a simplified web interface.Indeed, atomic swaps “could always be done manually,” Graber said. However, because this requires a degree of technical skill, before atomic swaps see mainstream use, easier to use platforms will need to be developed.At the same time, Lightning Labs, a company devoted to promoting bitcoin’s Lightning Network, recently conducted its first off-chain atomic swap on its test blockchain. Completed in November, the transaction saw litecoin and bitcoin swapped on an off-chain payment channel.Off-chain atomic swaps of this type are highly anticipated since trading would be automatic, not reliant on the processing times of different blockchains, but the technology needed to implement off-chain atomic swaps – things like the Lightning Network and Raiden Network on ethereum – are still under development.Which is why some, like Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, are less optimistic about cross-blockchain atomic swaps.Stark recently discounted the hype, writing on a development channel, “Anyone telling people that Lightning swaps will be ready in months doesn’t know what they’re talking about.”And in interview with CoinDesk, Stark said:“There’s still a good amount of infrastructure to build.”One website, swapready.net, provides a breakdown of how close each cryptocurrency is to supporting cross-chain atomic swap capabilities – and to date, there’s very few that can interoperate.Mirroring Stark’s sentiments, Philippe Castonguay, developer relations manager at 0x, which offers on-chain atomic swaps of tokens on ethereum, told CoinDesk that developers looking to create atomic swaps between vastly different protocols are faced with “a lot of challenges.”The infrastructure needed to interface between bitcoin and ethereum, for example, is still in development, and “to make it even worse, these cross-chain platforms also need to solve some of the main problems other blockchains are trying to solve, such as scalability,” Castonguay said.Yet, even with a lot a work still to do, many remain assured advances are close.Bosworth, whose work has focused mostly on developing applications for bitcoin’s Lightning Network, for one, made his excitement about a new era public, tweeting: “The atomic age is coming, what cannot be swapped will be left behind.”And Castonguay, whose work focuses on ethereum, also remains encouraged by the development happening within that ecosystem. Even if swaps between blockchains with different code bases prove cumbersome, he believes the blockchain could yield other solutions given the expansive capabilities of its code.“Eventually the ethereum blockchain will be able to communicate with other blockchains,” he said. “Once this happens, all the different coins from different blockchains will be representable on the ethereum blockchain.”For example, if bitcoin and ethereum blockchains can communicate with each other in a trustless way, then users could have an ERC-20 bitcoin on the ethereum blockchain, pegged one to one with bitcoin on the bitcoin blockchain, he posited.Such short-term solutions, he thinks, could help advance the atomic swaps concept overhaul.Castonguay concluded:“I do believe it is possible that some blockchains might be able to interact with one another this year, but I think 2019 through 2021 would be a safer bet.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo. Molecules model image via Shutterstock"

But it was only a little-known company (Mexico-based Cuallix) that had signed on to use Ripple’s xRapid to leverage XRP for liquidity.Flash forward to today, however, and the narrative has seen a shift.In rapid-fire succession, three money transfer firms revealed they are piloting the use of XRP. First was remittance giant MoneyGram, then came Mercury FX (which conducts about $500 million in transaction volume per year) and finally telecom provider IDT.To many, the news has been a vindication – not just for Ripple, but for the millions of mainstream investors that have embraced XRP as an alternative investment, helping it rise from mere cents early last year to nearly $4 this month.And while it’s still an open question as to whether such tests will go live, during the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse framed the general skepticism as old-fashioned and out of touch.Garlinghouse told attendees:“When I hear banks say, ‘We’re not going to use digital assets,’ I hear Randal Stevens say ‘AT&T will never use IP.'”So far, the largest interested party in XRP is legacy money transmitter MoneyGram, which in addition to being valued at $700 million, has over 350,000 locations around the world at which customers can pick up cash.However, the pilot does not directly serve any of those locations, according to a spokeswoman.Instead, the pilot is focused on implementing XRP within Moneygram’s internal corporate treasury transactions. In an email, she described an internal pilot for back-office functionality only.“MoneyGram is not using XRP in customer transactions,” the spokeswoman told CoinDesk.That might seem a bit strange, since a whopping 89 percent of Moneygram’s revenue in 2016 was generated from its money transfer service, according to the company’s most recent annual report, and XRP (and other cryptocurrencies) are widely targeted at cross-border money movement.But while those potential XRP use cases aren’t being tested yet within MoneyGram, Holmes said what the company learns from the internal pilot could someday inform much broader applications.The spokeswoman said:“The goal is to investigate whether it is efficient in terms of time and cost and to see if it can be a viable addition to our FX trading.”Perhaps more notably, London-based Mercury FX’s interest in XRP is geared towards consumer-facing applications.“I imagine we will be able to begin using XRP for customer payments in the coming months,” the founder and director of Mercury FX, Alastair Constance, told CoinDesk.He continued, saying, “As with all things, we will start with more modest sums in the thousands of dollars and increase by orders of magnitude from there. Come to the end of the pilot we will not be surprised if XRP is carrying single transactions across the blockchain of a million dollars or more.”By far the most detailed pilot, the Mercury FX project will use xRapid to conduct payments for goods and services in China and Mexico, with the hope that it will expand to other emerging markets via partnerships with Ripple and other platforms.While the software for the pilot is currently being integrated with Mercury FX, Constance said the pilot won’t likely formally begin for two more months, before concluding about three months after that.Not all of Mercury FX’s nearly $500 million in annual transaction volume will be conducted with XRP anytime soon, though, as Constance said he’s also exploring using some of Ripple’s other blockchain products that don’t require XRP.“Crypto is building into crypto from one side and fiat needs to build from the other side,” he said. “Ripple lets fiat companies like us do that.”While XRP dropped from its nearly $4 highs, it’s held relatively stable between $1 and $1.50.Yet, it’ll be interesting to see how news of new pilots and interest affect the price of the cryptocurrency, especially if new details about Cuallix’s work and IDT’s pilot are revealed.IDT declined to comment for this report, other than to point to its existing statements, where Alfredo O’Hagan, SVP of IDT’s consumer payments business said, “We’re excited to pilot Ripple’s xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost.”Cuallix did not respond to inquiries before press time.Of note also though, is another, newer use case for XRP – as venture capital.Last week, online marketplace Omni revealed it had accepted a venture investment largely in XRP, which it plans to use in part to pay the bills — such as paying freelancers.With all these new projects implementing XRP into the plan, no one is possibly more relieved than Ripple executives themselves, who had known of the interest, but had largely been unable to share it with the public.Ripple’s head of product, Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk:“We’re pleased to be able to share how payment providers are implementing xRapid to improve their payments flows. Remember, we just built and launched xRapid late last summer. This is just the beginning.”Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Bailey Reutzel contributed to this reportCorrection: This text has been modified to accurately reflect that Moneygram is valued at $700 millionClose up of microphone image via Shutterstock"

realize its full potential. This is the winning bid for Gram as a new ...","Jan 10, 2018 at 00:33 UTC",To describe Telegram’s planned initial coin offering (ICO) as ambitious would be an understatement.,"And it’s not only because the provider of a popular messaging app is seeking to raise $1.2 billion, according to three people familiar with the offering, which would represent the largest crypto token sale to date.Nor is it just because Telegram, with 200 million users, seems to be intent on bringing cryptocurrency payments to the masses.Rather, the proposed Telegram Open Network (TON) would seek nothing short of decentralizing online communication, with a suite of services, from file sharing to anonymous browsing, purchasable with the new crypto tokens, known as grams.“This is like Elon Musk-level ambition,” Kyle Samani of Multicoin Capital, who looked at the offering, told CoinDesk. In fact, Samani said he declined to invest in the ICO precisely because of its broad scope.“My concern as an investor is focus and diluted effort,” he said, since the TON aims to disrupt the same areas as several other blockchain startups that have also recently raised funds via token sales.Outlined in a 23-page primer on the offering obtained by CoinDesk, the TON is a blockchain protocol for the peer-to-peer movement of funds between users and to make purchases. This would interact directly with Telegram’s messenger app, which was created in 2013 at VK, the Russian equivalent of Facebook.Sources told CoinDesk that $500 million to $600 million was Telegram’s goal in a presale, with the other $600 million to $700 million to be offered publicly.The company is using the Simple Agreement for Futures Tokens (SAFT) structure, in which money is raised from accredited investors before a functioning network is built, in order to avoid running afoul of securities laws. The grams, eventually delivered to the SAFT investors, could then be resold to consumers.Telegram, which has not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment, would, no doubt, be the most mainstream company to issue a crypto token to date, although the social messaging app Kik raised $98 million in an ICO in September.“Many hedge fund managers are talking about the TON ICO,” said BitBull Capital’s Joe DiPasquale. “Telegram has owned the chat space for those in crypto, and our usage of the app is increasing due to its security and ease. It’s become the platform of choice for crypto discussion, and they will have a lot of attention leading into their ICO.” Calling the presale’s minimum investment of $1 million and cap on proceeds high and its one-year lockup long compared to other token sales before it, DiPasquale still continued optimistically, saying:“They are likely to be successful with a raise given their success as a platform to date.”Other investors CoinDesk spoke with were reluctant to discuss the sale, with one citing a non-disclosure agreement required to view the primer and a technical white paper.Rumors of the ICO plan started last week, and on Sunday a Russian-language slide deck marked “Ton_Draft” was posted on a Russian-language Telegram channel run by Fedor Skuratov, CEO of Combot, an analytics platform for the messaging app. TechCrunch was the first English language outlet to report the plan.While the document CoinDesk received, and other investors have confirmed receiving, does not seem to be the most detailed account of the TON system (its footnotes refer to the technical white paper), the primer does provide a basic outline of what Telegram hopes to achieve with its crypto token.In the document, the company declares:“The current state of blockchain technology resembles automobile design in 1870: it is promising and praised by enthusiasts, but inefficient and too complicated to appeal to the mass consumer.”As such, no cryptocurrency has gained truly mainstream success, yet Telegram believes, according to the paper, that a decentralized counterpart to everyday money is needed.The primer states that the company is hoping to enable the easy exchange of micropayments among users and bots, something that’s been of general interest throughout the blockchain space.In an effort to do that, the primer explains that 5 billion grams will be generated, with 4 percent reserved for the Telegram team (with a four-year vesting period) and 44 percent to be sold during the ICO.The remaining 52 percent will be “retained by the TON Reserve to protect the nascent cryptocurrency from speculative trading and to maintain flexibility at the early stages of the evolution of the system,” the primer states.According to a source with knowledge of the presale terms, the one-year lockup comes with a 60 percent discount.The ICO is likely all or a part of the “three big announcements” Telegram co-founder Pavel Durov told his followers about on his public Telegram channel on New Year’s Eve.According to the primer, the sale will take place in the first quarter of 2018, with the SAFTs converting to grams in the fourth quarter.The roadmap goes on to state that the first related product, “External Secure ID,” will launch in the first quarter of 2018, with all other products to be rolled out by the first half of 2019. And the Telegram founders’ control of the project will shift to a non-profit foundation by 2021.While the TON’s main priority is consumer payments, the primer goes into a number of services Telegram would like to build out that seem to encroach on territories, such as file sharing and privacy, already staked out by well-known and well-funded ICO issuers.For instance, the primer outlines:The company’s ICO plans must have come together quickly, according to the former chief technical officer at VK, Anton Rozenberg.“While I was working at Telegram, cryptocurrencies, ICO, blockchain, etc were never discussed,” Rozenberg, who left the company in April of last year, told CoinDesk.Still, many remain, if nothing else, wow-ed by the expanse of the project.Eduard Gurinovich, a Russian entrepreneur and founder of MyTime, which plans on launching an ICO in March, told CoinDesk:“Gram … is declared, essentially, as a new dawn for P2P.  This is something that could compete with bitcoin. Gram has the chance to realize its full potential. This is the winning bid for Gram as a new accounting currency, not an investing one.”Telegram Messenger image via Shutterstock"

Research. News; Learn; Research. Events · Latest · Opinion ...","Jan 9, 2018 at 05:04 UTC",What if blockchain could be used to actually save lives?,"That’s the thinking ongoing at pharmaceutical heavyweights Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi. The three companies – typically black boxes when it comes to their work – are now eyeing blockchain as a means of streamlining the process of developing and testing new drugs. Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, representatives from the companies shed light on how they are combining efforts to develop a blockchain framework that can address current logjams in the clinical trials process.But while it might seem strange that these fierce competitors are interested in working together, according to Jaydev Thakkar, product innovation lead for digital health at Amgen, there is growing momentum to collaborate on foundational issues of industry-wide importance.Thakkar said:“[The focus is] to help each other so that running the engine of clinical research is as optimized as possible for each of us.”In recent years, pharmaceutical companies have been put under more pressure to bring new, more personalized drugs to market faster and at more affordable prices and in a personalized fashion.But because of government regulations, the growing complexity of the studies undertaken and stringent standards, the current research and development process is highly cumbersome – with studies typically lasting between six and seven years. And about 90 percent of the drugs that enter clinical testing fail, according to Ken Getz of the Center for the Study of Drug Development at Tufts University, making the average cost of successfully developing a single drug about $2.6 billion.“The likelihood of recouping that $2.6 billion investment is much lower today than it was five years ago,” Getz said.Yet, Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi believe blockchain can help.“This is about execution and operations models,” said Munther Baara, senior director of development business technology at Pfizer. “It’s all about collaboration.”Ultimately, reducing the length and cost of clinical trials and improving their success rate is dependent on one thing in particular: improved data management and movement.On that front, the pharmaceutical industry faces the same problem as does the rest of the U.S. healthcare system, the fact that most data is stored in proprietary data silos with limited interoperability and transferability.“The issue that we all struggle with in pharma is … the fact that data is fragmented. If you see five different physicians, you end up with data stored in five different systems,” said Baara.And for pharma, the limited access to and portability of patient data means that locating and recruiting individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for a given trial is challenging.The current recruiting process involves hiring research organizations and investigators to beat the bushes, so to speak, by visiting physicians’ offices to find patients who qualify and are interested in participating in a study. The inverse is also frequently true, in that patients with diseases who want to participate in research often have difficulty being matched to an appropriate study.To bridge these gaps, a blockchain-based system could be used that allows individuals who want to participate in trials to aggregate their health data and make it visible to recruiters, according to the pharma executives.While the data on the ledger wouldn’t immediately be connected to a particular identity, recruiters could prompt an anonymous eligible candidate, and once the individual consented, their identity would be revealed.Baara added:“The beauty with the blockchain is the control is with the individual.”Yet, the individual is sometimes difficult to keep around.Because clinical studies typically span several years, retaining patients has also become a problem for the industry, particularly since entire studies can be invalidated if enough patients don’t show up within the required time window.As such, a blockchain-based conduit for patient interaction could offer immediate utility.“Today doctors and nurses running clinical trial programs are still having to resort to calls or post to remind patients about their appointments, which in this setting are particularly time-sensitive,” said Dany DeGrave, senior director of innovation programs and external networks at Sanofi. “In the future, we envisage automation will make the whole process a lot more efficient.”Not only do the executives think a blockchain system could automate communication between pharma company and patient, but they also think such a system would ensure the integrity of data. The latter is particularly important as regulatory approval for new drugs hinges on accurate data, and public trust in the pharma industry has ebbed and flowed over the years as stories of fabricated results make headlines.According to DeGrave, the immutable nature of blockchains could play a critical role in guarding against the falsification of data, and allow the public and other researchers better trust in the systems being used to track data.Currently, the three companies are working with the IEEE Standards Association, the standards body of the world’s largest technology association, to develop testbeds for implementing the technology and addressing the challenges.Regulators, for their part, also appear to be warming up to the concept. Representatives from the Food and Drug Administration, the primary agency overseeing the U.S. industry, will share their thoughts on the topic at an industry symposium in February.But as many industries flirting with blockchain are discovering, finding a sweet spot for implementing the technology is never quite as simple as it may sound.Specifically in the healthcare setting, firmly entrenched legacy electronic health records vendors, like Epic and Cerner, could stand in the way, much to the chagrin of blockchain startups in the space.“We need to overcome any barriers to the conversion of health care data into blockchain by providing the right incentives to the incumbents, in order to fully and quickly realize the potential we see in this new technology,” DeGrave said.That said, though, Pfizer’s Baara expressed optimism that the trend of consumers demanding more control of their personal health data will, over time, incent the current data custodians to relax their stranglehold.Yet, costs associated with innovating in the space and the risk-averse nature of the heavily-regulated sector also means there’s an additional imperative to make sure things go smoothly the first time around.“Like in any industry, we need to make sure the technology is mature enough before making sweeping changes to minimize any potential disruption,” said DeGrave, concluding:“The costs associated with change in our industry are enormous, so we’d better get it right early on.”Pharmaceutical production line image via Shutterstock"

day, too. Gorlick went as far as to say his dream is to make it easier ...","Feb 5, 2018 at 05:01 UTC",Disrupting the internet?,"Not just fodder for TV jokes, it’s a goal that continues to capture the imaginations of developers in the blockchain sphere, and Ben Gorlick and Johnny Dilley are no exception.Turns out, the developers liked the idea so much they ditched one of the most renowned tech companies in the blockchain industry, Blockstream, to join up with a startup called Crowd Machine where they now serve as the CTO and chief of system architecture, respectively.In short, the developers believe today’s cloud computing services, which power most of the internet, leave much to be desired. And, like many other blockchain and ICO projects, Crowd Machine thinks blockchain technology could be crucial to improving the situation.But with this project, there’s a twist.The long-in-development distributed cloud computer is unique in that it aims to harness the power of blockchain to make app creation faster and cheaper, and to do this using “any blockchain” they want, starting with ethereum.The idea has already attracted a handful of Fortune 500 companies such as GE and Anthem, who are now customers of Crowd Machine (according to the project’s website). Other “big IoT” company partners are reportedly planning to use it as their primary application, to be revealed in the coming months.Gorlick told CoinDesk:“What we’re working on is a real gamechanger with the way in which software can be built and executed.”That’s why Gorlick’s switching gears. Though he cherished working with “top minds in cryptocurrency and computer science” at Blockstream, he thinks it’s a problem that blockchains are so difficult to build on.“Empowering people to do that,” he said, was a key reason he switched.To explain how Crowd Machine works, Gorlick offered the idea of a basic calendar app.Usually such an app would be deployed on a commonly used cloud platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, because these tools make it easier to deploy and manage websites. Under the hood, every time a users updates the calendar, in what’s called an “activity,” the developer is charged.Gorlick thinks this setup is a “bottleneck” that leads to lot of waste.The efficiency of Crowd Machine, Gorlick said, comes from breaking each of these activities into a bunch of pieces then shooting them off to a network of devices that each computes them together. “The still runs and executes the program, but users aren’t bottlenecked to a single provider,” he said.If everything goes according to plan, users will be paid to run these programs on all sorts of devices, say if people have free space on their laptops, smartphones or even Internet of Things devices using Crowd Machine’s so-called “Crowd Computer,” set to be released in the final quarter of 2018.“That’s where the crowd computer was born,” Gorlick said.But, is this really a bottleneck for users? Gorlick offered the example banks using AWS have to reconcile their databases at the end of every day, a process that takes about an hour with platforms like AWS.“What we figured out if we didn’t need to depend on a single providers to many devices. That cuts down the time significantly, to 10 seconds or a minute,” Gorlick said, adding:“That’s going to be a huge money saver.”It uses “strong federation,” an idea Gorlick and Dilley came up with while at Blockstream, to give guarantees that nodes will run the code as they’re supposed to – in part incentivized by the Crowd Machine tokens.In short, the core idea is to cut down runtime costs, but another huge component is that Crowd Machine want to cut down the costs of creating the app as well.“Writing a smart contract sounds quite daunting. The barrier needs to be lowered,” Gorlick said.There are a few pieces to Crowd Machine, which makes it a bit confusing, almost with a “Rube Goldberg” feel to it. For example, the idea is you won’t necessary have to know how to code at all to be able to create blockchain apps, because Crowd App Studio allows users to create apps by way of a drag-and-drop visual interface.One section of the app even allows users to design ethereum smart contracts without needing to know ethereum’s programming language, Solidity, which is notoriously difficult to learn.Other blockchain languages, such as bitcoin’s Script, will be supported one day, too.Gorlick went as far as to say his dream is to make it easier for users in developing countries in Africa and Southeast Asia to bring their blockchain ideas to fruition without the costs of AWS.If these two pieces sound like unrelated, they actually tie together in a clever way.While the general idea of a distributed computer has an been an idea for a long time, Gorlick thinks tying easy app creation with the network will help with this problem.“It’s funny, there are a bunch of different companies out there looking to solve this problem of creating some sort of a supercomputer or a mesh network or edge computers,” Gorlick said.But he believes all to date have been lacking.“You kind of have the chicken-and-egg problem. If you build the best network ever, but you don’t have a development environment to utilize it, it won’t be used and you won’t get a network effect. You need to have a compelling reason to use a network in the first place,” Gorlick continued.He thinks the missing piece could be a development environment along the lines of Crowd App Studio making it easy to actually deploy apps on the blockchain.He concluded:“We believe that having an environment where you can execute and run them on a whole variety of blockchains is a compelling reason.”Crowd Machine image via YouTube"

However, the waiver does not apply to margin trades.In the blog post, the company reassured clients that their funds were kept safe during the incident and expressed contrition, saying:“We apologize for the uncertainty our downtime has caused. The scheduled downtime was to replace our old trading engine with a brand new trading engine – an improvement that customers have long asked for and that we have long been working hard on.”It all started when Kraken gave customers a heads up on Wednesday that the next day it would be offline for a systems upgrade. The company estimated then that this upgrade would take “about 2 hours … possibly longer.”As scheduled, the downtime began Thursday at 05:00 UTC, according to a status page on Kraken’s website. But the rest did not go according to plan.“We got a late start and the upgrade is moving slower than anticipated,” Kraken said on the page at 07:34 UTC, about a half hour after the the work was initially expected to be done.A few more hours went by, with a couple updates from Kraken. Then, at 15:27 UTC, it looked like there was a light at the end of tunnel, with Kraken telling users:“We are in the final stage of installing the upgrade now. We are getting close but hard to give an exact ETA since it depends on how the final testing goes.”No such luck. Three and a half hours later, Kraken said it now had to “resolve a number of issues that came up during final testing” and that it could not give a hard estimate for when that would be done.The pattern of periodic updates, but no resumption of service, continued. “Yes, this is our new record for downtime since we launched in 2013,” one update confessed. “No, we’re not proud of it.”All the while, users were unable to access their funds.

However when the new engine was moved to the production environment, regression tests picked up a condition that proved quite difficult to track down.”A more detailed breakdown of what happened, and how Kraken intends to prevent such snafus from reoccurring, will come in the next few days, the company said.In the meantime, it said it would be monitoring the performance of the new trading engine and cautioned that “the site will come down if needed, which may occur with little to no notice.”Progress bar image via ShutterstockCorrection: A typo in an earlier version of this article misstated the scope of Kraken’s waiver on trading fees.

We don’t want that to happen here,” Aquino stated.Local news source Philstar Global also suggested that ICOs may have to register with the SEC since it considers cryptocurrencies to be securities.Earlier this month, the SEC warned the public to take the necessary precautions in dealing with ICOs, and also filed a cease-and-desist order against four companies and an ICO operator citing securities registration regulations.Elsewhere, Chinese authorities outlawed ICOs last September, saying they were illegal under domestic law.“It is a kind of non-approved illegal open fund-raising behavior, suspected of illegal sale tokens, illegal securities issuance and illegal fund-raising, financial fraud, pyramid schemes and other criminal activities,” a joint statement read at the time.And, in September 2017, the South Korean Financial Services Commission prohibited local companies from taking part in ICOs, which it described as overly speculative and constituting a “violation of the capital market law.”Philippines flag image via Shutterstock"

At issue is the fact that over 1.1 billion people face not able to prove their identity, and thus struggle to access benefits and services. The situation also gives rise to more serious issues such as human trafficking, according to the World Bank.The initiative has now received a $1 million donation from Microsoft, as well as contributions from entities including Accenture and the Rockefeller Foundation. Accenture, one of the founding member of the initiative, announced a $1 million investment during the ID2020 Alliance summit last summer at New York.David Treat, MD of the global blockchain practice at Accenture said:“Decentralized, user-controlled digital identity holds the potential to unlock economic opportunity for refugees and others who are disadvantaged, while concurrently improving the lives of those simply trying to navigate cyberspace securely and privately.”The release explained that digital identity that is user-owned would include government-issued forms of legal identification and allow a seamless authentication process for people and institutions.“We are building an ecosystem of partners committed to working across national and institutional borders to address this challenge at scale,” Dakota Gruener, the Executive Director of the ID2020 Alliance, noted.Last June, Microsoft and Accenture unveiled a blockchain prototype for ID2020, that is powered by a private version of the ethereum blockchain.Passport and credit cards image via Shutterstock"

bitcoin and other public blockchains, but repositioned for enterprise.","Jan 30, 2018 at 13:00 UTC","Long considered one of the most promising code bases hosted by the Hyperledger blockchain consortium, Intel-contributed Sawtooth software is officially ready for enterprise use.","Revealed today, version 1.0 of the technology provides what might be expected, features inspired by bitcoin and other public blockchains, but repositioned for enterprise.Yet, what its team of 50 contributors — from startups including Bitwise and R3, and corporates including Red Hat and Capital One — hope will distinguish the solution is its modular functionality, designed to give enterprises across industries a head start on meeting consumer and regulatory demands.Among the early companies already using Hyperledger Sawtooth are telecommunications giants Huawei, which is building a decompiler for the software, and T-Mobile which is building an identity platform, along with e-commerce giant Amazon, which now lists Sawtooth among its blockchain partners.Indeed, Intel venture technical lead and Hyperledger Sawtooth maintainer Dan Middleton positioned the software as a way for enterprises with demands that exceed the capabilities of available public blockchains to capitalize on their benefits.Middleton told CoinDesk:“We feel that if companies really want to adopt blockchain, or a distributed ledger, then we shouldn’t forgo the basic blockchain properties in taking something from a public chain to enterprise usage.”Stepping back, Hyperledger Sawtooth is Hyperledger’s second open-source blockchain platform to emerge with an enterprise-ready 1.0 version, following closely on Hyperledger Fabric, which was contributed by IBM and launched last year.From a development perspective, the launch of 1.0 software solutions is an important step to any code base, as it signifies that the maintainers are committed to the core features, giving coders a sense of confidence that anything they build won’t break as a result of future upgrades.“For us, it’s a big event, both for the Sawtooth team because of stability milestone. But for Hyperledger, it’s evidence of a growing community of developers working on blockchain,” said Kelly Olson, another Sawtooth maintainer and member of the Hyperledger consortium’s technical steering committee.But beyond the potential importance to developers, there’s another key differentiator highlighted by the Sawtooth team in the launch: the innovative method by which computing networks running the software will be able to forge consensus on mission-critical events.Specifically, Sawtooth marks the business debut of a consensus mechanism called PoET — or proof of elapsed time — a variation on an older system called Byzantine Fault Tolerance that lets users reach consensus, even in an environment where counterparties don’t know each other.By comparison, other permissioned blockchains require that users know and trust each other. In this way, the blockchain platform is designed to resist denial-of-service attacks that become more likely in a more public blockchain, or one in which unknown parties might interact.Still, compatibility is also being sought with other blockchains of this nature. Notable in the final version is support for the Solidity smart contract language, pioneered by the ethereum blockchain.Smart contracts can also be written in Go, JavaScript, Python and more.“The maintaners aren’t promoting an unpermissioned version of Sawtooth,” said Olson. “But we’re trying to make the resiliency still available.”In addition to certain public blockchain features, Hyperledger Sawtooth has become known for the ease with which it can be integrated with hardware security solutions.And central to Sawtooth’s PoET consensus mechanism is a streamlined ability to integrate with hardware security solutions called “trusted execution environments,” among which is Intel’s newly launched scalable Xeon processor.The potential hardware integration was originally seen as a controversial solution because it places the security considerations of a decentralized ledger behind the protection of potentially fallible hardware. But the Sawtooth maintainers emphasized this is part of a balancing act between leveraging the strengths of public blockchains with transaction volume and security demands of enterprise companies.Further, they clarified that while a single company may provide the hardware that creates these trusted execution environments, Sawtooth hasn’t restricted that company to Intel.Olson concluded:“Sawtooth is a hardware-agnostic platform. There is no dependence of Intel hardware.”Intel chip image via Shutterstock"

bitcoin a fad (or worse), the more they signal that they don't get it.","Jan 7, 2018 at 10:00 UTC","Bradley Tusk is the founder and CEO of Tusk Ventures, which works with a variety of startups in regulated industries and has holdings in Coinbase and Ripple.","Everyone saw this coming. The New York Times reports that both the Russian and Venezuelan governments are trying to evade U.S. sanctions by creating new, state-sponsored cryptocurrencies that can avoid U.S. jurisdiction. Of course they are – that’s what rouge actors do. The question for us is how we deal with it.There’s a cliché called “death by a thousand cuts.” In trying to resolve each specific problem only after it arises, eventually there are just too many wounds and the patient dies. If the U.S. government just tries to go after each problematic example of crypto on an ad-hoc basis, that’s exactly what will happen (just like the War on Drugs has been a complete and utter failure) and it’ll never get ahead of the problem. That presents opportunity. This is not the time to play whack-a-mole. This is the time to recognize that crypto is real and here to stay. It’s time to start forming sensible regulations to help govern the sector broadly and wisely.What does that look like in practice? These are the first four steps we should consider:First, our institutions need to realize that the more they try to deny the legitimacy of cryptocurrency, the more they inadvertently reinforce why it exists in the first place. Trust in official institutions like government, organized religion, the media, and higher education are at an all-time low, all over the world. That’s why people want decentralized alternatives. The more that top officials in the public and private sectors keep calling bitcoin a fad (or worse), the more they signal that they don’t get it. No one knows for sure whether any specific currency will succeed or fail long-term, but I do know that crypto isn’t going away. The federal government needs to recognize this too.Likewise, the industry needs to recognize that the institutions aren’t going away, either. There are always bad actors in every sector and every walk of life. The public relies on government and the media to help separate the good from the bad. Absent embracing some form of regulations, the bad guys like Russia and Venezuela (or sham initial coin offerings with no technological value) will drag everyone down.That’s why we need national regulations on crypto assets (a 50-state patchwork approach is a very predictable disaster). We need to accept it as a new and permanent addition to the financial system. And then we need to regulate it as such: bank charters, licenses, standards, best practices and reviews. We have a slew of regulations to ensure that banks, mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, mortgage lenders and a host of other financial institutions meet certain standards. Some of those regulations make sense. Others don’t. But we all agree we need some structure to provide guidance, direction and ensure good behavior (or at least try to). The same applies here. The U.S. Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission should start working on what a national regulatory structure would look like and how it would work and the major players in the industry should eagerly volunteer to help provide ideas, advice, information and feedback.Then it needs to go global. Sure, between President Trump’s views on NATO, the U.N., NAFTA and free trade, this isn’t exactly a watershed moment for global cooperation. But for the very same reasons that bitcoin’s creation was fueled by a lack of faith in the financial system, if the standards governing crypto aren’t relatively similar everywhere, that futile game of whack-a-mole is still going to exist. And while we may not see the U.S. take the lead during this administration, by the time we have U.S. standards fully in place, we may have new leadership in Washington. In the interim, the World Bank and IMF should do as much as they can to start producing sensible global standards (including those that can help exile state-sponsored currencies designed to evade sanctions).Even if the value of bitcoin (or XRP or ETH or anything else) plunges, crypto will still be here. People will still search for alternatives to the status quo. Either we can pretend it’s not real and only exacerbate all of the problems by sticking our heads in the sand or we can embrace the advancement of new ideas, platforms and technologies and bring them into the fold, rationally and thoughtfully.  Russia and Venezuela are betting we’ll pick the former. Let’s prove them wrong.Whack-a-mole image by Shutterstock"

denominated in bitcoin and ether. But what's less clear is what a new ...","Feb 2, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","The on-chain governance protocol Tezos, long stalled by its own crisis of governance, lurched forward in several notable ways this week.","To begin, Johann Gevers, president of the Swiss-based Tezos Foundation kicked off events by publishing a blog post outlining his intent to use the project’s proceeds to hire operational staff (before later deleting it). Then on Wednesday, the foundation announced it had named a new board member, Lars Haussmann, to replace a seat left vacant in December.Not to be outdone, that same day, a grassroots group aiming to empower the project’s founders, a husband-and-wife team who have long been at odds with Gevers, set their own chess pieces in motion. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, a new Swiss Foundation, called T2, will launch with the intent of charting an alternate path to market. (The T2 effort actually consists of two organizations, a foundation and an association).Taken together, the events mark the latest phase of a drama that began in July, when Tezos raised $232 million, a record fundraising at the time, in an initial coin offering (ICO).According to the WSJ, the Tezos Foundation has control of those funds, denominated in bitcoin and ether.But what’s less clear is what a new foundation could do to assert control over the funds.“In the short term this is really just to show that the community has a real voice and say here. It’s been very clear to me that the community and the foundation are not in line at all,” Polychain Capital founder and T2 board member Olaf Carlson-Wee told CoinDesk.Carlson-Wee said that he had previously applied to be a member of the Tezos Foundation but was rejected, a move that led him to join T2’s seven-member board.The T2 Foundation was formed by Ryan Jesperson, a member of the Tezos Community who explained in a YouTube video Thursday that he personally funded hiring a Swiss attorney to represent Tezos backers to the authority that supervises these organizations in the country.He explained to CoinDesk:“We hope that the Foundation Authority will help fix the situation. That is part of the purpose of the Foundation Authority, to make sure that Foundations fulfill their charter.”Regardless, T2 has something of a nuclear option available to it.While the Swiss-based Tezos Foundation controls all the contributions made in the ICO, Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), the corporate entity for the project’s creators, holds the keys to something that might ultimately prove more valuable: the technology’s codebase.Along with today’s announcement, the T2 Foundation published an FAQ as a public Google document, and in that document, it proposes a radical option – that DLS would release the codebase with the same genesis block as planned.In this scenario, everyone would get the Tezos tokens they paid for, but the reserve tokens (10 percent of the total pool, vesting over four years) would be turned over to the control of T2 rather than the Tezos Foundation.If that happened and T2 took over supporting development, “resources would not be a problem,” Jesperson wrote.That is, assuming that DLS goes along with the plan and is legally capable of doing so under its “contractual agreement” with the Tezos Foundation. (Neither DLS nor the Tezos Foundation responded to requests for comment from CoinDesk.)Jesperson said, “This is a grassroots driven effort, but DLS is aware of what is happening and will ultimately make the decision on what they want to do.”T2 would prefer for Tezos to proceed as originally planned, provided the community supporting it gets more of a voice.Jesperson added:“This is not about one foundation being right or wrong, it is about preparing a place for the network to launch and making sure that resources are used for their intended purpose, to support the Tezos protocol.”Still, it’s hard to see how likely the scenario above may be. For one, CoinDesk has been unable to confirm how much funds have or have not been distributed by the foundation to DLS for development of the protocol.“To me there’s two legitimate paths: one is you allocate resources and support the community,” Carlson-Wee said. “The other path is don’t do it, and be extremely transparent about why.”However Carlson-Wee argues that the Tezos Foundation has taken a third path: not allocating resources and not explaining why.Some of the most needed resources cost little or nothing, he argued, saying that such a project should have basic community building, at a minimum: meetups, conferences, newsletters and blog posts. Additionally, it could also benefit from grants for beneficial but less lucrative projects, such as developing block explorers.None of those things have happened. If the T2 Foundation isn’t able to accomplish anything else, it should be able to start moving some of that community building forward.Of course, it’s essential that community has a protocol to organize itself around. Carlson-Wee has been watching the developments of Tezos codebase closely, via Github and the developers’ weekly YouTube posts.“Given the circumstances, I think it’s pretty impressive what they’ve accomplished,” Carlson-Wee said. In the background, accusations in the community have gotten heated. The Tezos Reddit, for example, has crowdsourced a professional history of the Tezos Foundation’s president and former business partners published a similar account on Medium.Meanwhile, the Tezos Foundation itself has launched a website that doesn’t appear in the internet archive before Feb. 1, and all Gevers’ old blog posts have been deleted from Medium.All the while, class action cases against DLS and the Tezos Foundation have been stacking up.Stephen Palley, an attorney with Anderson Kill in Washington who has long observed Tezos, asked whether the T2 founders were “thinking of how it will look in light of the pending litigation” in a phone call with CoinDesk.All of the documents and accusations released in the public sphere can be submitted as evidence to the fact that this is a project in disarray, he argued.“On the contrary, T2 gives all of the contributors more confidence that one way or another the Tezos network will launch and the lawsuits will be dismissed,” Jesperson argued.With a larger board and with more robust dispute resolution procedures, he believes T2 has been designed not to be beset by the Tezos Foundation’s trouble.“The most important part of the project, the code, is getting close to being ready,” Jesperson wrote.Carlson-Wee agreed, arguing that DLS’s work is too far along to justify the lawsuits proceeding, concluding:“I think before anything really comes of that the network will go live.”Image via Swissinfo.ch"

bitcoin technology that has stalled for years due to security problems.","Feb 1, 2018 at 05:00 UTC","When life gives you lemons to the tune of nearly $160 million, it’s not so easy to make lemonade.","But that’s just what ethereum startup Parity Technologies is seeking to do after a rough 2017, a year in which it suffered one of the most high-profile breaches in the history of blockchain. Far from a sinister hack, though, it’s had to face that its fortunes effectively changed when a novice developer “accidentally” froze the funds so no one could access them.Worse still, attempts at getting the money back don’t exactly look promising.Entering 2018, that could have an impact beyond just a single startup. Far from a conventional business, Parity supplies support for one of the two most widely used clients on ethereum, providing software roughly a quarter of the network uses to operate.And like other blockchain conglomerates (think the ever-expanding Brooklyn startup ConsenSys), Parity has diverse interests. Also affected by the incident was the Web3 Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the development of the Polkadot blockchain, and it is also led by former ethereum CTO and Parity founder Gavin Wood.The much-heralded blockchain for blockchains raised roughly $150 million in an ICO last year, and as reported by CoinDesk, funds lost in the Parity freeze included the ICO earnings.As such, Ashley Tyson, a spokesperson for the Web3 Foundation, acknowledged that the loss to its operations has been felt. Plans to deploy bounties designed to fix code weaknesses and grant programs to spur development, she said, have been scrapped.Tyson told CoinDesk:“With a majority of our funds frozen, we’re not sure what our ability is to financially contribute to these initiatives. Certainly, it will need to be massively scaled back.”Yet, the affected companies are rebuilding and continuing to develop their software, with some major projects proceeding almost as if nothing happened.So far, the best example of Parity’s ability to bounce back is the release this week of its node software, which improves the speed of its ethereum client while adding a range of updates.A bigger and more long-term project, though, is their so-called ethereum “bridge.” Based off an age-old idea in blockchain, the tech has been in development for a while, with Wood telling CoinDesk in November the project was 70 to 80 percent complete.For now, the prototype can be used to connect the ethereum network with Kovan testnet, meaning users can send their funds to a special ethereum smart contract and locks those funds for use on an experimental version of ethereum.Unlike the main blockchain, Kovan comes to consensus via a mechanism called “proof-of-authority.” Though it’s not as decentralized, it’s still designed to make sure no one’s making transactions they really shouldn’t be making, replacing ethereum’s miners with a set of approved authorities.This is a first step. And if and when the project is finished, users will be able to seamlessly send their money in this way to any ethereum-like network.Eventually this will be used to link ethereum to Polkadot, an idea described in the “Polkadot white paper” to connect many blockchains together with the help of incentives and game theory.This is a pretty big step in and of itself, though, since the company is the first such ethereum “bridge” to connect two networks with such different underlying algorithms.To put the project into context, they are trying to achievedsimilar functionality to sidechains, a long-promised bitcoin technology that has stalled for years due to security problems.Despite the frozen funds, development updates show the bridge is still in progress, with the developers releasing a number of security improvements a couple weeks ago. One of the next big steps for the bridge is to move funds back and forth in a decentralized fashion.“We’re getting all our ducks in a row. Soon it will be time to start machine gunning them down,” Wood said.And for Wood, the hack is less of a debilitating loss and more of an expensive growing pain.In interview, Wood and Parity Technologies developer Robert Habermeier both spoke in a manner that alluded to the nascent state of ethereum broadly, with Wood noting it only “kind of” works as it was envisioned today.With this in mind, Wood is still confident Parity can make progress on technologies that will bolster the blockchain he helped found. (Wood was the author of the ethereum “yellow paper” and is responsible for much of its high-concept math).“For ethereum to continue its fairly staggering success story its gonna need to scale,” he said, noting that’s another thing Polkadot, moved along by the bridge prototype, can help.Along these lines, Web3 Foundation is building on its plans to help develop the rest of the decentralization world, partnering with a range of ethereum projects with the same goal of keeping data in the hands of users.It’s hosting a workshop bringing together a number of budding decentralized exchanges in Berlin, Tyson told CoinDesk, and plans work with developers of encrypted peer-to-peer technologies that shield data passed around on blockchain networks.Still, she stressed that Web3 Foundation won’t be crystal clear about its budget for another couple of months, and it won’t be able to contribute to the overall ethereum ecosystem as much as ot hoped.And with technical ideas for recovering the funds shot down by other ethereum developers so far, there still might be hurdles to come.Tyson told CoinDesk:“We would obviously like to find some way to recover the funds, but the process for that is still unclear. We will take time to engage the community on what their concerns, feedback and suggestions may be.”Correction: An earlier version of the article misstated that a file deletion froze the funds.

cryptocurrency. Governments around the globe are moving forward with 
blockchain ...","Jan 7, 2018 at 11:00 UTC",Joshua Ashley Klayman is co-head of global law firm Morrison & Foerster LLP ‘s Blockchain + Smart Contracts Group and chairs the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance Legal Working Group.,"The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2017 in Review, and represents the author’s personal views, not necessarily those of her employer.The year that just ended was transformational.Blockchain and cryptocurrency entered the common vernacular. Previously, my family and friends, many of whom likely viewed me as earnest and well meaning – yet nonetheless tinfoil hat-wearing – politely tolerated my attempts to regale them with tales of how “blockchain can change the world.” But now, dinner conversations regularly revolve around digital tokens and exchanges – and the ever-popular question, “Why didn’t you tell us sooner?”  I find myself smiling at the realization that, now, sometimes I am the one at the table who tries to change the subject when cryptocurrency come up.Those exchanges aside, geeking out about blockchain remains one of my favorite pastimes, and, happily, in 2017, I had the pleasure of meeting many like-minded people.  This time last year, however, I had no idea that many of my closest crypto-collaborators, my blockchain sounding boards, and, truly, some of my best friends, would be lawyers I’d meet in the market.Lawyers at large firms, small firms, no firms, in-house. Lawyers from across the United States, and from around the world. Whether formed in think tanks and legal working groups, or forged on social media platforms, like LinkedIn, those blockchain legal relationships have proven to be meaningful, real and enormously valuable.Perhaps that is my take-away: 2017 was the year that individual lawyers and law firms got over themselves and worked together, at least in the blockchain space.My prediction: In 2018, the speed and scale of technological developments will make non-traditional legal teaming not just nice to have, but critical.In recent years, the legal profession has not exactly been known for its imagination or its cross-firm collaboration.Lawyers as a group are famously risk averse – intense legal training designed to illuminate potential hazards and liabilities also may make it hard to un-see or look beyond those identified risks. Lawyers often are applauded – or, at least, self-applauded – for their abilities to guide entrepreneurs down well-worn deal paths, sticking to precedent, doing things the way they are supposed to be done.In fact, a more experienced lawyer once cautioned me, “the last thing any client needs is a creative securities lawyer.”But 2017 was a year that turned this and other conventional law firm wisdom on its head, at least in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. For me and likely many other lawyers, this was the year that I rediscovered a life of the mind and the law became fascinating and fun again.At the end of 2016, the idea that the next twelve months would bring with them more blockchain and crypto-related work than one law firm, or even several law firms, could possibly handle, may have sounded to many like a wild and unrealistic hope. To the contrary, in 2016, at least one major financial institution had openly expressed an intention to develop smart contracts with a goal of reducing legal spend.Could any of us have predicted how many new legal questions and theories would arise, or how many old and supposedly settled areas of the law would awaken and pose exciting new puzzles? Technological innovations and the proliferation of token sales and cryptocurrency trading have transformed deal planning into veritable law school issue-spotting exams.Who knew that technologists and founders would be discussing the Howey test at cocktail parties, that legal panels would be standing room only, or that the SEC’s Cyber Unit would exist, let alone achieve a sort of celebrity status?Alongside many brilliant founders, we lawyers in the crypto world have been given the tremendous opportunity and privilege, and the awesome responsibility, of being on the legal front lines of this exciting new ecosystem.  We get to interpret and sometimes even shape the various regulatory frameworks that will or may apply. Shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients and each other, we lawyers have been given the chance to be co-artists and co-designers of compliant and truly transformative technological and commercial endeavors, and not just deal jockeys and naysayers.What has driven so many lawyers to band together as thoughtful, well intentioned allies?Is it risk aversion? Partially. Many responsible lawyers may hesitate to give legal advice about novel questions without seeking the views of others whom they respect. Few lawyers may want to risk being the outlier, giving out-of-step advice. There may be a perceived safety in numbers.Is it a matter of self-selection? In other words, are those lawyers who are most deeply immersed in the blockchain community naturally more open to new experiences, more collaborative, creative, and trusting, more inquisitive? Possibly. (Admittedly, as one of those lawyers, I kind of like that idea, because it paints a favorable picture. We all like to be special.)In my view, however, these collaborative legal communities and relationships are emerging because they work and, I’d argue, are necessary for lawyers to continue to provide meaningful legal advice.In the face of rapidly developing, expanding universe-scale innovations and ecosystems, we cannot go it alone. Even a single token sale, for instance, typically requires a team of lawyers from multiple jurisdictions, covering myriad legal content areas – among others, securities, commodities, money transmitter and other financial services, investment company and investment advisor, broker-dealer, tax and intellectual property – and many, if not all, of those legal content areas are changing or being re-examined in real time.Fortunately for the crypto community, many talented lawyers have been brave enough to take stands and make them public, resulting in groundbreaking legal analyses and proposals – including “A Securities Law Framework for Blockchain Tokens,” “The SAFT Project:  Toward a Compliant Token Sale Framework,” “Not So Fast – Risks Relating to the Use of a “SAFT” for Token Sales” and “Conceptual Framework for Legal and Risk Assessment of Blockchain Crypto Property (BCP).”These are not mere vanity projects. In a legal landscape filled with risk and few bright lines, we still need to provide practical advice to our clients now.Rather than analytically wrestling alone with, for example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s The DAO enforcement action or Munchee cease and desist order, by understanding, critiquing and building upon our legal peers’ views, we arguably collectively can come to better reasoned views, and do so more quickly. Our learning in this space is incremental; why not build a knowledge ladder together and climb it?Perspective sharing among lawyers (and interested non-lawyers) may take place in working groups (like the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance), “think tanks” like Wharton RegTech, panel discussions, LinkedIn posts or even just quick calls to across town (or across-the-world) colleagues or so-called competitors. To my mind, it matters less how these discussions take place than that they take place.Blockchain technology has enabled us to form new communities that transcend geographic, socioeconomic and other traditional boundaries.  Maybe it makes sense that the old, siloed law firm models need to evolve, as well.We are experiencing a technological tidal wave of new business models and novel legal questions, and regulators, market participants and lawyers all are trying to navigate the current.  The entire blockchain ecosystem arguably benefits when lawyers focus some of their energies outward, beyond their individual firms – advancing legal discussion and theory and grappling together to interpret and apply legal frameworks – rather than solely inward.This shift in priority from maximizing at all costs an individual firm’s competitive advantage to developing a shared, industry-wide understanding may yield powerful economic, intellectual and interpersonal benefits, just as blockchain technology itself promises.Aligning and realigning ourselves in flexible, nimble teams, across organizations and areas of expertise, may result in better thinking, more refined reasoning, a deeper combined knowledge reservoir. Not to mention more fun.In our blockchain space, the very speed of change appears to be accelerating.What we tinfoil hat wearers hoped for in 2016 is beginning to happen. Bitcoin futures exist in our present.  Hedge funds are trading cryptocurrency. Governments around the globe are moving forward with blockchain technology initiatives. The United Nations’ pilot program reportedly has sent vouchers to refugees using the ethereum blockchain.The token sale genie is not going back into the bottle, and many predict torrents of self-described security tokens next year, particularly once a sufficient number of alternative trading systems have been launched.Entrepreneurs and investors, eager to devise imaginative capital-raising techniques, are exploring mini IPOs and the intersection of equity crowdfunding and token sales. Chambers and Partners released its first-ever list of blockchain and cryptocurrency lawyers globally. Legal white papers are quoted like bestsellers, and just about everyone has a view about the SAFT. It is an exciting time to be a crypto lawyer.In my view, 2018 is likely to bring with it types of technological and economic artistry that we cannot presently envision, and nearly all of those innovations will need to be understood and analyzed through a legal lens. The global blockchain and cryptocurrency community needs a strong, yet quickly adaptive, base of legal understanding on which to build and blossom. We need an informed regulatory climate that protects individuals, while encouraging technological innovation to flourish.The future is fast, and our legal advice must be sound. In 2018, cooperative and creative thought leadership by blockchain lawyers (and non-lawyers) will be key.Have a different vision for blockchain in 2018? CoinDesk is now accepting submissions for its 2017 in Review.

number ...","Jan 26, 2018 at 13:15 UTC","Sitting at his desk at Credit Suisse, Sina Nader watched the bottom fall out of the global economy.","As a junior associate helping manage a $100 million portfolio of equities, he had a first-hand view of the 2007-2008 collapse from the Swiss bank’s Los Angeles offices and recalls frantically taking screenshots of the price as Lehman Brothers’ stock collapsed to “essentially zero.”“My first thought was, ‘Holy shit, some traders just took out Lehman,'” Nader told CoinDesk. “My next thought was, ‘Holy shit, if the fifth-largest investment bank in America can be taken out like this, is the banking system actually safe?'”Likening it to the feeling kids get when they learn Santa Claus isn’t real, Nader says that the day changed him forever – and eventually sent him into the wild world of cryptocurrency.After going down the crypto rabbit hole, Nader, who’s also worked for Morgan Stanley, teamed up with a former private wealth analyst at Morgan Stanley, Jacob Kirschenbaum, and others to launch Cryptolux Capital, a crypto fund of funds.And revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nader has secured about $50 million of the $100 million the fund is seeking.While the number of crypto hedge funds has grown from about 124 in October to 175 today, Nader positions his experience in one of the traditional financial system’s worst hours as the key to Cryptolux’s success.“I look back to what I saw in the financial services world, and that really sets the stage for me to be excited about crypto,” Nader said. “When you’re watching the five biggest investment banks in the country either go out of business or change their entire business model, you realize that the banking system is not as strong as many people may have believed it was.”He continued:“I’ve got this view that this banking system is not infallible, and wouldn’t it be nice if there was a system that went around, or was outside of the banking system for the use of wealth?”According to Nader, Cryptolux is designed specifically to take advantage of the lessons he learned, in an effort to offset the downside risks of the volatile cryptocurrency market.At the heart of that is Nader’s captivation by bitcoin’s ability to store value outside the traditional banking system. If the financial sector buckles again, bitcoin won’t go down with it.But as he started looking at crypto hedge funds more broadly, he saw a number of cryptocurrencies and funds diversifying in the cryptocurrency space outperforming bitcoin itself by as much as 200 percent.So, he started talking to other investors and coming up with a strategy that would capture those huge gains.And Cryptolux believes it’s found that strategy in a targeted fund-screening process that looks for an attribute he contends is all too rare among today’s cryptocurrency speculators, just as it was in investors before the financial collapse: humility.“Anyone who really claims to know exactly what is going to happen in the crypto space is probably misguided at best,” Nader said, adding:“So I think it’s important to come at this space with a strong amount of humility, because I think it will inform your investment strategy and ultimately your trading.”The second way Nader aims to offset downside risk is by further hedging with cryptocurrency futures options.Nader said, initially the fund will establish short positions in the nascent bitcoin futures market. In the event of a market correction or pullback, he expects the bitcoin futures position will increase, providing Cryptolux with a buffer against the dips.Currently, Cryptolux is only investing in bitcoin futures, but Nader expects to add ether futures should that product get approved by regulators.Hinting at which hedge funds Cryptolux is mixing into its fund of funds, Nader said he’s “excited” about Silver 8 Capital and MultiCoin Capital, though he’s keeping an eye open for changes in the strategies of the fund managers over time, and could modify his own fund’s composition accordingly.And going forward, Nader said the firm will be exploring the possibility of expanding its investments to include proprietary positions in crypto startups and other blockchain-related companies.For interested investors, there’s a $1 million minimum to join, with a 1 percent management fee and a 15 percent carry on money made from the investment. By early next month, Nader expects to reveal further details about the company’s risk management program along with other new features.And if all goes as planned, he hopes to raise a second fund targeting $125 million.According to Nadar, he’s primed to do it, saying:“Our view of what our value-add is, is we give you a diversified portfolio and we take care of the risk management component on top of that.”Image via Sina Nader"

Further, XRP is still down 23 percent over the last 24 hours. At press time, XRP is trading at $1.39.As per OnChainFX, XRP is down 63.41 percent from the record high of $3.84 set Jan. 4.A look at the charts suggests XRP may have found a bottom and could consolidate in the next 36–48 hours before possibly resuming the sell-off.The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:Clearly, the 4-hour chart is loaded with bearish price patterns that indicate scope for a drop to $0.8610 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement). However, the relative strength index (RSI) on the chart above shows oversold conditions.As seen in the chart above, the 5-day and 10-day MAs have adopted bearish bias (sloping downwards). The RSI also favors further downside in XRP. The tide has clearly turned in favor of the bears.However, the 50-day MA is curled up in favor of the bulls. This coupled with the oversold conditions on the 4-hour chart (as shown by the RSI) and the doji candle on the 4-hour chart could keep XRP rangebound in the next 36–48 hours.The 50-day MA would shed its bullish bias (top out) following a bout of consolidation, thus opening doors for further losses.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Ripples image via Shutterstock"
