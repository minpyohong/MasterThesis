as it leads the way in Bitcoin friendliness. 50499 Total views.","Jan 8, 2018","While the Asian market accounts for a large portion of the cryptocurrency market, not all of the countries in the East have been as receptive to the burgeoning market. However, the situation is totally different in Japan thanks to a soft approach from government and much higher adoption.","Japan continues to lead the way in the East with its approach and as such, there is a higher interest from the citizens, including from the self-proclaimed ‘Miss Bitcoin.’Mai Fujimoto, aka Miss Bitcoin on her social media platforms, figure-heads an attitude that seems to be crowing in the Land of the Rising Sun. She boasts how all of her disposable income is deposited straight into Bitcoin.“I convert all my disposable income into cryptocurrency,” the 32-year-old told AFP. “I’ve been doing this for nearly a year now. I convert all my savings into cryptocurrency instead of putting them in a bank.”The attitude in places like China and even Korea is one of the people battling against the regulators. There is huge interest in these two nations from the citizens, but regulators have put their foot down.China’s ban on ICOs, and then exchanges, set a huge precedent in terms of the hard-nosed approach to digital currencies.Korea also recently started taking steps towards its own style of the ban on digital currencies, however, despite that, there is still massive interest.Japan also set its own precedent in the understanding of Bitcoin as back in April it was announced that Bitcoin was accepted as legal tender, instantly showing a positive approach from the government.Japan also benefited greatly from China’s ban as many companies and investors crossed the Sea of Japan to set up shop on the Island.Japan was also the pioneer in terms of Bitcoin adoption as about six months ago there was a boom in businesses trying to integrate Bitcoin payment systems. Even salaries are starting to be paid partly in Bitcoin. A well-known commentator on the crypto-business in Japan Koji Higashi said:“The involvement of big companies, the sense of security derived from government approval and media exposure really brought in a whole new group of people to the market.”Bitcoin also comes at a great time for the investment-savvy Japanese as ultra-low interest rates from the deflation-battling central bank that has left investors scratching their heads for places to find returns on their cash.However, some are suggesting that it is more hype and mania than savvy investing.Higashi adds:“Everyone else is doing it now and I heard they are making a lot of money. I have to get on it now. That’s a very Japanese way of thinking. To be honest, I am not sure if people are buying into Bitcoin based on rational decision-making. It feels more of a short-term irrational mania to me.”"

Cap",https://cointelegraph.com/news/80-of-all-bitcoins-already-mined-only-42-million-coins-left-until-supply-cap,"This means only 4.2 million bitcoins, or 20 percent, are left to mine until 
Bitcoin's 21 million supply cap is reached. BTC contains the 21 mln cap ...","Jan 15, 2018","Jan. 13 marked an important milestone for Bitcoin when 16.8 million bitcoins (BTC), or 80 percent of the entire Bitcoin supply, were mined. This means only 4.2 million bitcoins, or 20 percent, are left to mine until Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap is reached.","BTC contains the 21 mln cap built into its protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto, first mentioned in their 2008 White Paper, as a way to introduce digital scarcity to cryptocurrency. With such a cap in place, the more bitcoins are mined, the more scarcity is produced on the market.Scarcity arguably creates demand, which in turns makes the coins more valuable. Once 21 million bitcoins have been mined, it will become even harder to obtain them, also potentially making each coin more valuable.Miners currently receive a 12.5 BTC reward for every block that they mine, but Nakamoto’s protocol also requires that the mining reward is halved every 210,000 blocks, or approximately four years. The next miner halving will take place within two years, approximately in early June 2020 depending on hashrate, bringing the rewards down to 6.25 BTC per mined block.Not every digital currency is mineable like BTC. Some cryptocurrencies are created with the entire supply released all at once, in which case the total supply is either held or in circulation and there is no way to “mine” or mint new coins.Some examples of non-mineable digital currencies are Ripple, IOTA, NEM, NEO, Qtum, Omisego, Lisk, Stratis, Waves, and EOS.Skeptics have proposed that it is theoretically possible to increase Bitcoin’s 21 million capped supply of Bitcoin via a 51 percent or a Sybil attack, but so far neither of these manipulations has proven feasible in the case of BTC.Altcoin Krypton, which is based on Ethereum, experienced a 51 percent attack in August 2016, but no other such attacks have taken place since then.BTC is still recovering from the Dec. 22 market dip, trading at an average of $14,200 and up about 4.75 percent over 24 hours to press time."

profiles of people who probably wish they'd never touched Bitcoin at ...","Jan 14, 2018","The year of 2017 was a fantastic year for some Bitcoin users, but others were not so lucky with the cryptocurrency.","Below, we’ll look at some of the most impressive success stories of the year, as well as the profiles of people who probably wish they’d never touched Bitcoin at all.It’s a highly erratic currency, but people who invested in it before its recent prominence often found their foresight was lucrative in ways they never imagined at first.One anonymous person who posted a detailed story on Steemit said that in 2010, the price of each Bitcoin was so low that it was not even valuable enough to buy a pizza. Still, by the end of that year, the person reportedly had 12,000 Bitcoins and collecting the large number of them paid off.That’s because by April 2013, the worth of each Bitcoin had ballooned to over $100. Due to some issues in the individual’s personal life and a few other non-Bitcoin-related factors, the person took a couple of breaks from Bitcoin but was never completely out of the loop with them. Eventually, this anonymous Bitcoin user heard that the 12,000 Bitcoins were now worth over $10 mln.Despite that fortunate turn of events, the person only began selling them in small quantities so as to not attract attention. The individual also planned for the future by choosing investment strategies and did not let the rapid wealth impact their employment. As words of advice, the person suggests exercising patience and not getting greedy, while also keeping up on newsworthy events.Erik Fineman began investing in Bitcoins in 2011 when he was only 11 after his grandmother gave him $1,000 and his brother offered him a tip about what to do with the money. In those early days, Bitcoins were only worth $12 each. However, when Fineman sold his first Bitcoins at the end of 2013, each one had a value of $1,200.By then, Fineman had turned the $1,000 from his grandma into $100,000 and used it to start an online education company in 2014. He hadn’t had a pleasant experience in high school and thought that his new business venture could connect frustrated students and willing teachers over video chat. Fineman also moved to Silicon Valley, traveled the world and made a bet with his parents that if he were a millionaire by age 18, he’d not have to go to college.In January 2015, Fineman sold his education company and was given the choice of accepting  $100,000 or 300 Bitcoins. He took the Bitcoins. Fineman also achieved his goal of becoming an 18-year-old millionaire and won’t be going to college. He says he’s happy learning from real-world experiences. However, Fineman stays busy with numerous projects, including involvement with NASA. Those activities — and savvy business sense — feasibly helped him get where he is today.Jeremy Gardner is another person who boldly began investing in Bitcoin during the early days — notice a pattern here? — and received a substantial payoff. In 2013, one of Gardner’s friends got him some Bitcoins in exchange for cash and Gardener began feeling fascinated about how he could work with the currency with nothing more than an Internet connection. He also loved how there was no centralized regulatory body for Bitcoin.  As Gardener became immersed in the Bitcoin world, he became a strong and emphatic voice in the cryptocurrency world, often using social media as a platform. He also wisely invested money into starting and supporting companies associated with Bitcoins and Blockchain technology.Gardner stops short of disclosing how much money he’s made by investing in Bitcoin technologies, but is referred to as a “self-made millionaire.” Plus, he keeps a realistic perspective and understands that whenever the value of Bitcoins goes up rapidly, it’ll likely also go in the other direction soon. However, Gardener has a broad network of investments. Those interests are arguably helping protect his worth and allow him to get financial benefits from numerous sources.Traveling the world is something many people dream of doing, but Mr. Smith has turned that aspiration into reality, all due to Bitcoin investments starting in 2010. A man with a college education and former Silicon Valley employee, Mr. Smith, heard about Bitcoins in July of 2010 and began investing in them a few months later.Knowing he was in it for the long haul, Smith put his Bitcoin investments on the backburner until 2013, a time when the cryptocurrency’s value started rising rapidly. Eventually, the price per coin went up to more than 2,000 times what Smith originally paid for it. He now claims to have made $25 million from an initial $3,000 investment and uses the money to go on lavish, round-the-world travels that involve only staying in five-star hotels and flying first-class.Smith still owns 1,000 Bitcoins, but only wants to sell those once the per-coin value reaches $150,000. He has no regrets about selling the rest and says he has everything he ever wanted, thanks to Bitcoins.Tim Enneking is a prime example of how to succeed in Bitcoin investing. He’s a hedge fund manager who achieved the all-time annual records for both funds and funds of funds.Enneking was skeptical of digital currencies, although he started running the world’s first digital currency fund. During his work, Enneking decided to rigorously research Bitcoins. After realizing he didn’t find any red flags, he concluded perhaps there was more to the cryptocurrency than he’d originally thought and started looking for ways to become more heavily involved in funds management.Enneking now has experience overseeing funds within the US and abroad. He advocates being cautious while investing and taking time to understand market trends. Furthermore, Enneking reminds potential investors that due to the rapid fluctuations of digital currencies, it may take time to see investments become fruitful.You might not have heard of 26-year-old Olaf-Carlson Wee before, but he’s another person who recognized the potential of Bitcoins before many other people and got rich as a result. In February 2013, at a time when a single Bitcoin’s worth was between $20-30, Carson Wee began working for a Bitcoin startup called Coinbase.At that time, Bitcoins were not part of the cultural consciousness yet, and the mere mention of them caused raised eyebrows if people were aware of them at all. However, Carlson Wee viewed Bitcoins as a promising currency. He made an arrangement with his employer to only get paid with them instead of physical money and started making transactions with Bitcoins whenever possible. Those decisions were ultimately profitable because they made Carlson Wee a millionaire.The success stories you just read might be enough to make you want to start investing in Bitcoins immediately. But, if there’s a consistent thread in all those outstanding stories, it’s that the Bitcoin value changes without warning. However, some people have unfortunate circumstances related to Bitcoins that aren't always about their falling value. You’ll see some examples below.  James Howells, a 32-year-old man from Wales, started working with Bitcoins from a computer in 2009. A year later, he disassembled the device and stored the parts in a drawer, then eventually threw them away.Because several years’ worth of trash now lie on top of the valuable but discarded hard drive, retrieving it is an expensive process, and the condition of the hard drive is unknown. However, the reason why the ramifications of this failure became especially evident this year is that estimates suggest the hard drive and the Bitcoins it contains are worth more than $100 mln at today’s prices.  Howells keeps an upbeat attitude about his lost fortune and knows there’s no point in getting too upset about it. If he ever does recover it, however, he’ll buy a Lamborghini.Despite how things turned out for Howells, he hasn’t given up on cryptocurrencies. He’s still active with them today and puts his energies into one called Bitcoin Cash.Most people have gone through the frustration of forgetting passwords and PINs, but they probably don’t have to deal with the aftermath of losing the equivalent of $30,000 because of the blunder. However, Mark Frauenfelder invested $3,000 in Bitcoins last year and had numerous profitable ventures afterward. He talked to Bitcoin experts who told him that using a hardware wallet was the best way to protect his Bitcoin cache, so Frauenfelder bought one in November 2016 for $100.While setting up the hardware wallet, he had to set up a PIN, along with a 24-word list used to recover access if needed. Frauenfelder wrote down the words on a piece of paper. Unfortunately, a cleaning company employee threw the document away. Frauenfelder didn’t think that was a big deal at first until he discovered he’d forgotten his PIN.Desperate to regain access, he went online and posted on forums, plus contacted customer service representatives associated with the hardware wallet manufacturer. Frauenfelder even visited a hypnotist this spring, but the session did not bring about successful results.At long last, he got help from someone who helped him hack into the hardware wallet and get the PIN and 24-word list. But, not without substantial heartache, stress and paying money for retrieval methods.The anonymous nature of Bitcoin may compel people to use the currency for illegal things. However, as a 58-year-old Italian woman who lives in Denmark learned, doing that can cause trouble. She hired a hitman to carry out a failed murder plot related to her boyfriend and used Bitcoin to pay for it.A court ruling resulted in a six-year jail term. It also caused her to lose residence privileges in Denmark, where she’s lived for 30 years.Cody Brown, a startup executive, saw first hand how bad things could get during a Bitcoin theft. He lost $8,000 worth of Bitcoins in 15 minutes after a hacker got into his Verizon account, which was connected with Coinbase. Brown believed he got targeted because of a tweet he’d RT’d from a friend who’d also been hacked earlier. Brown is not hopeful of ever getting the stolen cryptocurrency back.However, he’s also not giving up on Bitcoins. Brown believes that the companies involved in it will eventually figure out how to lock their systems down tighter and potentially add more fraud protection resources for customers.Simon first used the TOR network in 2011. He stumbled upon one of those shady online marketplaces that offered all kinds of illegal things, — guns, drugs, counterfeit documents, you name it.As a teenager, Simon decided that getting a brand new passport for a certain European country would be a neat thing to do. The price tag was 10,000 BTC. If he threw in an extra 6,000 BTC, the seller promised to get Simon a press ID from an esteemed newspaper, too. He couldn’t resist.Simon transferred his funds to a crypto-exchange platform but, when it came time for the merchant to deliver, the merchant disappeared. ‘Maybe he got arrested?’ Simon wondered to himself.  He was confused, but he still had his money safely tucked away in the exchange account since the seller had vanished. All was okay as far as he was concerned.Two years later, newspapers began reporting the arrest of a Russian man accused of money laundering. The name of the laundering service he had controlled was Liberty Finance, which Simon instantly recognized as the crypto-exchange platform he had used to keep his 20,000 BTC.In light of the scandal, the FBI seized control of the exchange platform and all money associated with it. Simon kissed that money goodbye long ago, but it doesn’t make it easier for him to see how Bitcoin has appreciated over time.If Liberty Finance hadn’t been a money laundering scam, Simon would have acquired some $400 mln dollars.Despite the lack of regulation in the Bitcoin world, entities that are breaking the law still get caught. Case in point? BTC-e, a long-running Bitcoin exchange.It received a $110 mln fine from the Federal Trade Commission for alleged money laundering. Also, Alexander Vinnik, a Russian man associated with the exchange got arrested and faces over five decades in prison if convicted.Another recent incidence of alleged questionable behavior from Russia comes from Anatoly Kaplan, the owner of ForkLog, a Russian cryptocurrency news outlet. According to reports, the Ukrainian Secret Service is investigating Kaplan in connection with alleged associations with Americans involved in unlawful activities.The Ukrainian authorities searched Kaplan’s apartment and confiscated his laptop. Also, this is not the first time ForkLog has come to the attention of law enforcement officials. Kaplan maintains his innocence and asserts his site does not have technology capable of the things the Ukrainian police accuse him of doing.Kaplan also says during the search and seizure related to the investigation, one of the Ukrainians tried to transfer some of Kaplan’s Bitcoins. Kaplan and his attorney plan to take legal action and are confident about a positive outcome, but even so, this event has already caused stress and unfavorable publicity for Kaplan and his ForkLog site.These tales of wonder and woe prove that Bitcoin investments are not for the faint of heart.The people who engage in them must be ready for ruin, but they might become amazingly prosperous instead."

away from being a functional currency. 117931 Total views. 1047 Total ...","Jan 12, 2018","About six months ago the news was littered with companies that were looking to integrate Bitcoin as a payment system. However, in the fast-paced cryptocurrency ecosystem, things have changed dramatically.
","Now, there is a host of companies either turning away from Bitcoin or doing a full U-turn. Microsoft recently announced that after almost three years it would stop accepting Bitcoin. However, it did reserve that position after taking its own steps to: “ensure lower Bitcoin amounts would be redeemable by customers.”
Steam, the gaming platform, also canceled its use of Bitcoin as a payment system in early December last year. Their reasons resonated with the general consensus, citing high fees and incredible volatility as the main issues.
It is not only those outside of the crypto market though; The North American Bitcoin Conference set to be held in Miami next week, is no longer taking Bitcoin for last-minute tickets.
It has been a bone of contention with Bitcoin since its fees started averaging about $2, now with transactions costing upwards of $20, people have started looking at Bitcoin as something other than a digital currency.
The North American Bitcoin Conference said on its website that network congestion and manual processing influenced the decision to stop accepting payments in cryptocurrencies.
""We have, and always will, accept cryptocurrencies for our conferences, up to fourteen days before the event,"" the organizers wrote. ""However, due to the manual inputting of data in our ticketing platforms when paid in cryptocurrencies, we decided to shut down Bitcoin payments for last minute sales due to print deadlines.""
It would seem that it is possible to link Bitcoin’s change in categorization back to when SegWit2x failed to launch and thus sent Bitcoin on a monster rally that saw it end the year 13 times stronger than when it started.
Bitcoin was having problems defining itself as a digital currency, or as digital gold, and due to the nature of the cryptocurrency, it was defined democratically as SegWit2x was not taken up - for a number of reasons.
It was thought that SegWit2x would help lower costs and speed up the network; however, Bitcoin’s value as a store of value would probably take a hit.
And, with interest in Bitcoin being driven by the mainstream acceptance of the digital currency to be an asset that grew exponentially, it seemed that the community was keen to see it move towards being so-called digital gold.
The very fluid nature of Bitcoin’s evolution means that it could still become a very useful and viable currency if the community decides. The latest change that could be on the cards is the Lightning Network which would help hugely with Bitcoin scaling issue.
The Lightning Network would implement a smart contract script into the Bitcoin network that would open private payment channels between a peer and all of the other peers they transact with. In addition to all the private payment channels they are a part of, each of peer would have one channel open to the Bitcoin Blockchain.
#CT_questions Do you think #Bitcoin Lightning Network will be implemented on a large scale this year, and will it help with the congestion problems?"

other asset classes by a huge margin. The big question on everyone's 
mind ...","Jan 9, 2018",The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of authors/contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk; you should conduct your own research when making a decision.,"Last year was a stellar one for Bitcoin, as it opened trading at $966 before embarking on a rally that took it to as high as $20,000. Even after the volatility of the past few days, Bitcoin has beaten all the other asset classes by a huge margin.The big question on everyone’s mind now is: what will happen in 2018 and how should one trade Bitcoin?The experts are divided in their opinion. The aggressive bulls have given targets of above $60,000 for 2018. That’s a 300% increase from the current levels. On the other hand, the skeptics continue to question the cryptocurrencies’ valuation, calling it a bubble.Some expect wild swings in 2018. Saxo Bank’s outrageous prediction lists a possible high of $60,000, followed by a drop to $1,000. Similarly, cryptocurrency entrepreneur Julian Hosp believes that Bitcoin will fall to $5,000, but he tends to think that it will also touch $60,000. He is not sure which level will be reached first.While the predictions offer us different opinions, it is difficult to trade off them. So we have tried to identify a few unique patterns on the charts that repeated in 2017. These can be used as guidelines by the traders to develop a suitable strategy for 2018.In 2017, 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) acted as critical support. As seen in the chart, this level was breached only four times.In all other instances, the price touched the moving average or dipped below it during intraday, but quickly recovered. So, a purchase close to the 50-day SMA offers a low-risk buying opportunity. Buy close to the 50-day SMA and keep a stop loss below it.Bitcoin offered low-risk entry opportunities to the long-term traders en route to its 20-fold rise in 2017. It has not traded below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) since October 2015, which is critical support.In 2017, whenever the cryptocurrency broke below the 50-day SMA, it came within a striking distance of the 200-day EMA. This proved to be an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors. Even in the next fall, a move close to the 200-day EMA should be seen as a buying opportunity.The price will not necessarily fall as low as the 200-day EMA, even during a large correction. On Jan. 12, for instance, it bottomed about 6.5 percent above the 200-day EMA. Similarly, on March 25, it was about 2.5 percent above the 200-day EMA. On July 16 the bottom formed 10.7 percent above the 200-day EMA.Though not perfect, traders can start their purchase about 15 percent above the 200-day EMA, with staggered buy orders below that.How do we calculate how far above is the price from the 200-day EMA?Though there doesn’t exist any specific indicator for it, we can use the “Price Oscillator” (PPO) by altering its values smartly. The PPO offers the percentage difference between two exponential moving averages. Therefore, if we need to plot how far away the price is from the 200 EMA, we can feed the values of 1,200, which will give us the desired result.If the price breaks down of the long-term moving average, it is a warning signal that things have changed. It indicates that Bitcoin is either entering into a long-term downtrend or into a range-bound action, which will require a different trading strategy.In trading, profit is made by buying and selling at the opportune time. While we have identified a low-risk buying strategy, we have yet to ascertain the best time to sell. Let's take a look at that, next.There was no indicator that would have given a consistent sell signal at the top. But it was noted that a simple trendline did the job perfectly.As seen above, though a break and close below the trendline did not get you out of the position right at the top, it certainly helped to lock in most of the gains.Another indicator that could help is ADX.Even as far back as 2014, a reading above 60 on the ADX has been a good selling point for Bitcoin.It is easy to identify and fit indicators and trendlines once the chart has formed. Doing the same with live markets is not an easy task. All in all, it is almost impossible to forecast cryptocurrenciy price movements for the whole next year ahead, because the marker is still young to have developed repetitive patterns of price behavior. Try avoiding long-term prognosis. Happy trading."

difficulty finding solid support. 61210 Total views. 279 Total shares.","Jan 9, 2018","After breaking through the $20,000 mark on Dec. 17, Bitcoin suffered a rather large correction to $12,000 before rebounding and settling between $13,000 and $15,000. However, the digital currency has suffered a few setbacks since that monster rally, leaving some to wonder if the bull run might be over.","The 2013 bull run was ended by the dramatic collapse of Mt. Gox, and so far, nothing that big has happened to Bitcoin. Nonetheless, it’s always possible that the end of 2017’s extraordinary run could die by a thousand cuts.Last year, China first banned ICOs and then closed cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Now the government is taking aim at mining. China has long been the epicentre for Bitcoin mining, in large part due to the country’s inexpensive electricity prices. Now the Chinese government is considering restricting Bitcoin miners’ access to inexpensive sources of power, which would significantly change the economics of Bitcoin mining.There has also been a change in the dominance factor of Bitcoin as many looked to diversify their digital currency portfolios to better performing altcoins. Coins like Ripple, Ethereum and Tron have surged in value, essentially stealing market share from Bitcoin. As recently as March 2017, Bitcoin made up 85% of the total market capitalization of the entire market. Today, Bitcoin’s so-called dominance, or market share, has dropped to an all-time low of 33.6%.The second largest country in the world, India, is starting to look hostile as its government seeks to tighten regulation on digital currencies. Recently, an advocate for Public Interest Litigation filed to immediately regulate the flow of Bitcoin in and out the country.In Venezuela, a place where Bitcoin has flourished due to the unrest and economic breakdown, President Maduro has ordered the issue of the country’s own digital currency, the Petro, which Venezuelans might see as Bitcoin’s competition. However, it should be noted that a country officially issuing its own digital currency certainly adds legitimacy to the concept of cryptocurrency as a whole. Further, since Maduro can’t restrain himself from printing a nearly unlimited supply of Bolivars, it’s likely the Petro will eventually suffer the same hyperinflation.The charts are indecisive, with Bitcoin’s price currently in a consolidation pattern. Expect this sideways “triangle” to break either up or down later this month. Volume is also down, below its 30 day moving average, but this is common in a consolidation phase.It should be remembered that the rise from $9,000 to $20,000 occurred in just three weeks, so the market likely needs some time to get its legs back under it."

depressed following waves of fear, let's take a look at what's actually 
been ...","Jan 25, 2018","It has been a depressing fortnight for anybody reading various mainstream headlines touting the ‘end of Bitcoin’ and the arrival of the ‘crypto bubble’ crash. Unsurprisingly, the most recent cryptocurrency market slump has led to naysayers stepping onto their soapboxes, crying out messages of ‘I told you so’.","Their rhetoric is not unfounded, given that the overall cryptocurrency markets have suffered two dramatic corrections in under a month, one just before Christmas and the most recent last week. So-called industry experts have been voicing their opinions in interviews with mainstream media, speculating on the burst crypto bubble without any real evidence to show that the markets are irreversibly damaged.A wave of uncertainty in South Korea led to massive sell-off of cryptocurrencies last week, as traders unloaded amid fears of regulatory clamp downs from the government. Those fears were led by misleading reports of an all out cryptocurrency trading ban in a country which accounts for 20 percent of global trades.It is now understood that South Korea will only ban anonymous trading - meaning people wishing to trade cryptocurrencies need to do so through authorised exchanges using a registered bank account. Furthermore, foreigners and minors in the country are now prohibited from cryptocurrency trading, while the government will tax exchanges in line with existing policies.This was coupled with murmurs of further regulatory moves in China, which has already banned cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Unsurprisingly, the markets reacted as they would with any hint of bad news, which has led to bearish attitude.Financial service giant UBS is particularly bearish towards Bitcoin. Speaking at the World Economic forum this week, chairman Axel Weber said the company had advised clients to steer clear of investing in Bitcoin. In an interview with CNBC, Weber said:“Retail clients, who don’t fully understand these products, should be protected from going into these products, because if there is a retail client affected in the future, the question will be again who was the bank that sold them these products and then banks will be blamed again for what has happened.”Weber went on to say that the growing interest in cryptocurrencies around the world will inevitably lead to further regulation. Regulations, as he told Bloomberg in another interview, could lead to further market corrections.Earlier this week, Wall Street analyst Peter Boockvar suggested that Bitcoin could drop as low as $1000 in 2018. He also attributed the rise in popularity of cryptocurrencies to their inflation-proof nature and scarcity.One theme that is becoming increasingly clear is that mainstream investment institutions are still worried about regulations crippling the future of cryptocurrencies. As Weber noted in his interview with Bloomberg, investors’ interest is always piqued by growth in value of any asset. He admits that cryptocurrencies have not gone unnoticed, but the uncertainty of their future is too risky for institutional investors to go in 100 percent.However, what goes unspoken by critics is that any positive moves by countries could bring about exponential growth and adoption of virtual currencies.

These moves make some cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, more attractive to investors, due to the fact that they are both finite and safe from debasement and inflation.People have long questioned whether Bitcoin fits the mold of a traditional “bubble.” Yale economist Robert Shiller, who won a Nobel prize for his work on financial bubbles, used Bitcoin as an example of a bubble in September 2017. However, in January 2018, Shiller then said that he didn’t know what to make of Bitcoin, adding that it could be around for another 100 years.BTC is trading at around $11,820 at press time, down about 1.52 percent over a 24 hour period."

Others, like Venezuela, have been forced to do so to battle out-of-control inflation that has crippled its economy. Opposed to a decentralized and anonymous system, the creation of a cryptocurrency that governments can control is their only option to wrestle back some semblance of ‘control’ that has been handed to the everyday man using cryptocurrencies.Speaking to RT at the WEF in Davos, Universa CEO Alexander Borodich said governments are keen to issue their own virtual currencies that would be backed by commodities like oil.“From my perspective, they will offer state country-wide cryptocurrencies like Cryptorruble or crypto-barrel if they like to… back the oil they have or other natural resources.”He added that 2018 would see the emergence of these state-issued cryptocurrencies to challenge the dominance of Bitcoin and other popular virtual currencies.Despite the best intentions of honest developers, exchanges and Blockchain engineers, there is a prevailing sentiment that the underworld still uses cryptocurrencies. It’s been a number of years since the closure of Silk Road and subsequent black markets, but heads of states are still citing concerns over the nefarious uses of virtual currencies.As quoted by the Independent, US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin said there is a concerted effort being made to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for illicit trade.""My number-one focus on cryptocurrencies, whether that be digital currencies or Bitcoin or other things, is that we want to make sure that they're not used for illicit activities.”A major concern is also the well-being of financial markets and systems that have been shaken up by the massive adoption of Bitcoin and altcoins in the past 12 months. In the words of Mnuchin:""We encourage fintech and we encourage innovation, but we want to make sure all of our financial markets are safe. We want to make sure that the rest of the world -- and many of the (Group of) 20 countries are already starting on this -- have the same regulations.”IMF head Christine Lagarde also painted a harsh perception of cryptocurrencies.""The anonymity and lack of transparency and the way in which it conceals and protects money laundering and financing of terrorism is just unacceptable. It needs to be taken into account but then there will be innovations coming out of these movements.”Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency community has been bullish on social media, slamming the apathy swirling around at Davos this week."

The survey revealed that 75 percent of individuals between ages 18 to 24 have learned about Bitcoin, and 74 percent of Russia’s capital Moscow’s population is now aware of the cryptocurrency.However, only a minority of the individuals that have already heard about Bitcoin understand that Russian citizens and residents can invest in the cryptocurrency market. Over 16 percent of the individuals with underlying knowledge in Bitcoin still believe investing in Bitcoin is illegal in Russia.For many months, the Russian authorities have teased the regulation of its local cryptocurrency exchange market. In early October of last year, Russian authorities agreed to legalize cryptocurrencies and regulate the country’s cryptocurrency market by licensing exchanges.Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was quoted by local media outlet TASS news agency as saying:“The President has spoken of the problems related to cryptocurrencies. These are difficulties regarding ... money laundering and cases that are related to identification issues. That’s why we have agreed that the state should regulate the issuing of cryptocurrencies, their mining and turnover. The state should take all this under control.”At the time, Siluanov and the rest of the Russian government came to a consensus to implement strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies to prevent money laundering and cryptocurrency businesses from running fraudulent operations.In October, the Russian Finance Ministry stated publicly that it plans to regulate the Russian cryptocurrency market by the end of 2017. In December of the same year, Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of State Duma's financial markets committee, noted that a cryptocurrency bill has been introduced and it will likely be adopted in March 2018.""The problem is that we already have a lot of people who acquire [cryptocurrencies] and they are deceived, we need to give people the opportunity to work legally with it, to protect them as much as possible,"" said Aksakov.The Russian president Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to set up regulations for the trade of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, ICOs and mining by July 2018Earlier this month, the Russian President said in an interview with TASS: “This is the prerogative of the Central Bank at present and the central bank has sufficient authority so far. However, in broad terms, legislative regulation will be definitely required in future.”Moreover, in late 2017, Putin also requested the Russian government to regulate its cryptocurrency mining industry properly, as an increasing number of mining centers have reallocated to Russia to utilize its cheap resources and electricity.Several Russian provinces and cities have also been encouraging cryptocurrency miners to relocate their businesses from other leading regions like China to Russia, as the global cryptocurrency mining industry evolved into a multi-billion dollar market.As shown in the survey mentioned above, more than a quarter of Russians that are already aware of Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market still believe that cryptocurrency investment in Russia is illegal, and lack of regulations within the local market is restricting the adoption of Bitcoin.Proper regulation of the Russian cryptocurrency market would likely lead to a surge in interest, demand, and volume, allowing Russia to compete against Japan, the US, and South Korea as a major cryptocurrency market."

The majority of Nordea’s employees are members of either one of the two unions, according to The Next Web.Nordea had defended its decision as prevention of employee participation of “criminal” or “unethical” participation in an “unregulated market.”Director of media Stine Green Paulsen further agreed with a conclusion put to him by Finans.dk that they could technically “buy as many bitcoins as they liked” before the deadline, adding, however, that this was “not a recommendation.”As a major Nordea operating area, Denmark has seen increasing hostility towards Bitcoin from regulatory circles recently.Last month, Denmark’s Central Bank chief warned users to “stay away” from the cryptocurrency, going as far as to describe it as “deadly.”At the same time, Bitcoin Suisse’s takeover of a major Danish sports team means the country now has a ‘Bitcoin Arena,’ while its players could become the first sports professionals to receive their salary in BTC."

In such a market for Bitcoin, it is easy to predict downturns, which is fueling many anti-Bitcoiners to spread negativity about bubbles and crashes.","Cleary buoyed by his last statement on Bitcoin Peter Boockvar is one of these such people. He has come out again saying the bubble is about to pop and Bitcoin will fall to about $1,000.The Chief Investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group called Bitcoin crashing a few days before it tipped $20,000 and then collapsed to half that.This Wall Street veteran again highlights the divide that is still strongly cut in Wall Street. With more adoption, there has been some softening of opinions, so much so that even the steadfast Jamie Dimon has changed his tune.In the current cryptocurrency market, it is easy to make dire predictions on the likes of Bitcoin, which is struggling to make it back from its drop. As such, there has been an onrushing of bears to the fore.These predictions cannot be stopped, or nor should they, for it is freedom of speech and the opinion of an expert in the field - albeit sometimes the field of institutionalized investing is distant from cryptomarkets.However, their power is akin to the power of positive prediction and the hype that comes with them. In the run to Bitcoin’s peak last year, the likes of Ronnie Moas, John McAfee, Tom Lee and others were battling to keep their predictions up with the rising price of the digital currency.Those Bulls have been silenced somewhat  and it has left a soapbox open for Boockvar, who said:""I think over time Bitcoin's going to be around for a long time but the price itself I wouldn't be surprised if over the next year it's down to $1,000 to $3,000.""This is, of course, an opinion of someone who has been anti-Bitcoin from the outset, and bearish on its chances. What this entails for Boockvar is more how it can impact the stock market, an environment the Wall Street veteran is far more comfortable in.""From an economic standpoint it's not really something that's relevant in a $19 tln economy,"" Boockvar said when asked if Bitcoin’s collapse would have far-reaching implications.""Maybe in South Korea and Japan – and even in the US – where people are taking on credit card debt to buy coins, yeah they are going to be necessarily impacted,” he added.While the sentiment in the crypto market is always seemingly heavily swayed one way or the other, with very little time for a stable middle ground, it becomes tough to follow opinions. In these bearish times, it is easy to make negative comments on Bitcoins chances, and equally so, it is easy to predict the moon in the good times.Co-founder and Fundstat strategist, Lee is one of the few on Bitcoiners that are speaking out. Instead of seeing the low points in Bitcoins trajectory as panic points, he sees them as buy opportunities. Lee said:""We expect Bitcoin's major low to be $9,000, and we would be aggressive buyers around that level [...] We view this $9,000 as the biggest buying opportunity in 2018.""He also added a reversal of Boockvar’s opinion forecasting that Ethereum and Ethereum Classic would see about 90 percent growth by the end of the year."

market despite the government's heavy crackdown on the industry. 101338 ...","Jan 27, 2018",Chinese citizens are still investing in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market despite the government’s heavy crackdown.,"In September 2017, Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin were ordered by the government to shut down their businesses. At one point, executives of the three cryptocurrency exchanges were prevented from leaving the country, due to a government investigation into local cryptocurrency exchanges.Three months later, in December of 2017, China’s three largest cryptocurrency exchanges relocated their businesses to Hong Kong. BTCC China, Huobi and OKCoin rebranded to BTCC, Huobi Pro and OKEx, respectively. They intended to address the rapidly growing demand from Hong Kong-based investors.Shortly after their move, the three trading platforms started to see daily volumes from Chinese investors grow exponentially. Somehow, Chinese investors were managing to circumvent Chinese trading restrictions by using Hong Kong-based exchanges. How is this possible?In Hong Kong, it is relatively easy for investors to set up businesses. With less than $1,000, businesses can be legally created, which allows the opening of business bank accounts at Hong Kong-based financial institutions. Beginning in December 2017, many Chinese investors moved their funds from their Chinese bank accounts to Hong Kong bank accounts and started to trade cryptocurrencies more actively, effectively bypassing China’s restrictions.But, unlike China, Hong Kong has a substantially lower supply to meet the growing demand. While China is home to major miners like Bitmain, Hong Kong does not produce much Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As such, premiums in the Hong Kong cryptocurrency market increased, surpassing even that of the South Korean market. On January 18, when the global average price of Bitcoin was around $11,500, Bitcoin was being traded at above $13,000 on Huobi Pro.Krystal Hu, a Hong Kong-based finance journalist, noted that traders outside of China have also started to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presented by the Hong Kong market. For instance, on January 18, the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase was $11,800. Purchasing Bitcoin from Coinbase and selling it on any Hong Kong-based market would have generated $1,200 in profit.Hong Kong’s exchanges have also integrated widely-used fintech applications in China such as Alipay and Tencent’s WeChat Pay. Alipay is a $60 billion fintech app that is used by more than 50 percent of mobile users. WeChat Pay, which was only used by seven percent of mobile users in 2014, is now being used by more than 40 percent of mobile users in China.The integration of the two fintech payment networks has increased the accessibility of Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency OTC exchanges for Chinese investors, easing the process of investing in the cryptocurrency market.To prevent Chinese investors from buying digital currencies, the Chinese government and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), have asked local banks to disclose any suspicious transactions linked to Hong Kong-based markets. However, even this action will not be able to prevent Chinese investors from accessing Hong Kong-based markets, due to apps such as Alipay and WeChat Pay."

Gox cryptocurrency exchange, and claims that it correlated with the sharp increase of the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013:“The USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity.”The suspicious activity mostly consisted of two bots, Markus and Willy, which used bitcoins that they didn’t own to perform what appeared to be valid trades. These fraudulent transactions were included in the overall trading volume by the Mt. Gox exchange, showing a higher than normal amount of trading activity and thus prompting the public to begin trading legitimately.The paper postulates that the use of the Willy bot and its trades were additionally used to cover up an earlier hack at Mt. Gox:“A theory, initially espoused in a Reddit post shortly after Mt. Gox’s collapse (Anonymous, 2014b), is that hackers stole a huge number (approximately 650,000) of bitcoins from Mt. Gox in June 2011 and that the exchange owner Mark [Karpeles] took extraordinary steps to cover up the loss for several years.”The price manipulation that occured in the early Bitcoin crypto market, and the possibility for it to happen now as well, is due to the relatively thin market for cryptocurrencies that leaves them vulnerable to high price fluctuations.Chairperson Jay Clayton of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave a speech in November, warning about the high potential for price manipulation in the market for initial coin offerings (ICO).Back in August 2017, Cointelegraph reported about an anonymous actor, known as Spoofy, who has been manipulating the Bitcoin markets by “spoofing” (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel before the execution) large amounts of bitcoins.Spoofy, who also engaged in wash trading, or buying and selling to himself, has been successfully manipulating prices mainly on the Bitfinex exchange, which in turn influences the whole market due to how thinly cryptocurrencies are traded."

With international co-operation in regulating Bitcoin comes a chance for regulators to take control, says Wuermeling.There has been increased regulatory pressure on Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency market recently, which has been felt across the board. The confusion that began in Korea caused a major dip, and even the retraction of those statements helped the market grow.Within these regulatory moves, from individual national countries, there are often powerful moves seen across the entire global cryptocurrency market. However, they are never really big enough to bring it under full control.These are case-by-case regulations, and these instances are not strong enough on their own for the free running cryptomarket to be constrained by.“Effective regulation of virtual currencies would therefore only be achievable through the greatest possible international cooperation because the regulatory power of nation states is obviously limited,” Wuermeling said.The issue is that there are two very different views to regulating Bitcoin, and these views can differ from country to country.Japan is one of the strongest supporters of the digital currency market, giving Bitcoin currency status last year. However, just across the Sea of Japan, on the mainland, China has been the lead actor in the war against Bitcoin.First there was the ICO ban, then the ban on exchanges, and now there is more bad news for those who even deal in exchange-like services.It is hard to find an agreeable position on digital currencies for nations with so many torn between different ends of the scale. This is one of the reasons why regulation is so difficult.There is also the discussion of the need for regulation as it seemingly flies in the face of what Bitcoin is trying to accomplish with its decentralized nature. Cal Evans, an International Technology Lawyer from London, says:“As the cryptocurrency “grows up” it has had to overcome some serious compliance and regulatory problems internationally. These regulatory issues are numerous in nature depending on which country you read this in. Yet one problem seems to slip under the radar time and time again. Money Laundering.”Adding to the devious nature, an unregulated currency brings London’s Kingston University economics professor Steve Keen echoes similar sentiments.“You can’t be deregulated in a system where there will be criminal attacks. The code itself is clearly not foolproof. People will find their way in, forks will be forced upon them, whether they want them or not. In that situation, regulation may be the only future.”It is clear that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to exist in ways that many regulators disapprove of unless there is a united front on wresting the digital currency economy under global control.Even banning the stuff in countries in China has only proved to be a speed bump in the road, Bitcoiners, and the likes can always find a way."

While Bitcoin remains in a volatile state, it is still head-and-shoulder above its altcoin predecessors in terms of value per coin. A plethora of cryptocurrency and mainstream financial analysts have likened Bitcoin to gold for this very reason.Well-known American broadcaster Max Keiser has been particularly vocal about his predictions for Bitcoin. While he envisions the preeminent cryptocurrency hitting $100,000 highs, Keiser also believes Bitcoin will lead to the revival of physical gold trade, by highlighting speculative trading methods employed by mainstream traders:“Bitcoin is helping gold by shattering the matrix of Wall Street that is incurring the naked short-selling and financial manipulation that is going on in the futures market of gold.”In a document published on Jan. 25, the World Gold Council (WGC), the market development organization for gold, shed light on its stance towards cryptocurrencies. According to their statistics, gold saw 13 percent growth in value in 2017- which by all accounts is a positive statistic, but it pales in comparison to the parabolic growth of Bitcoin during the same time period.Nevertheless, WGC’s report went about explaining its stance on cryptocurrency, and why it sees gold remaining an integral store-of-value investment in the age of cryptocurrencies. It’s hard to call the arguments shockingly fresh though as gold trade sees less volatility, its market is far more liquid and highly regulated. It is also well-established as an investment portfolio.The WGC highlighted the fact that gold has a far higher day-to-day liquidity. In relation to gold’s $250 bln worth of trades per day, the WGC estimates that Bitcoin’s daily trade is worth around $2 bln- roughly the equivalent of gold-backed exchange traded funds.Another factor is the diverse uses and applications of gold. Gold’s highest demand comes from the jewelry industry, accounting for 50-60 percent of gold demand over the past 20 years. Another 30 percent of demand comes from the investment portfolio, while the rest applies to the tech industry and central banks.As the WGC cites, Bitcoin’s supply increases at around four percent each year- as it nears its 21 mln coin cap. This will only be reached in the year 2140, due to the scaling difficulty of mining - but this anti-inflationary process is a common characteristic shared with gold as the WGC points out in its report:“Approximately 3,200 tonnes of gold have been mined on average, each year, adding about 1.7 percent to the total stock of gold ever mined. Bitcoin’s future diminishing growth rate and ultimate finite quantity are clearly attractive attributes, as is gold’s scarcity and marginal annual growth.”While the WGC clearly wants to quash any comparisons to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, the industry seems to appreciate the value of Blockchain technology. The distributed-ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and various altcoins have proven its value, and bright minds began exploring almost limitless applications of Blockchain systems. According to the WGC, the gold industry is among them:“In the gold market, various players are exploring Blockchain in the context of transforming gold into a ‘digital asset,’ tracking gold provenance across the supply chain, and introducing efficiencies into post-trade settlement processes.”This is likely to be done on private Blockchains.

But this latest analysis suggests that it’s not all doom and gloom for China’s biggest mining operators, including the likes of Bitmain, BTCC, BW mining and BTC.com.While power surveys have cited the massive power demand of the global Bitcoin mining industry, China’s operators are by far the biggest.However, BNEF’s statistics highlight the true scale of the country’s mining industry in comparison to the overall electricity supply. China’s miners use 15.4 terawatt hours of power, which amounts to 0.2 percent of the country’s annual electricity production.The highest electricity rate for Chinese miners is $0.13 per kilowatt-hour. However, as Lu reports, operators can negotiate prices down to as low as $0.03 - meaning miners would be profitable as long as the Bitcoin price stays above $3,869."

Since the country’s currency reforms, interest in Bitcoin especially has skyrocketed, with local exchanges reporting huge growth.At the same time, India’s central bank has issued repeated warnings on cryptocurrency investment, some of which appeared tantamount to calling it illegal.During his budget speech today, Jaitley stated:“The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system.”While Jaitley’s speech noticeably avoided any mention of legality of crypto in and of itself, commentaries by third parties and mainstream media journalists controversially claimed that a ban was imminent.“Arun Jaitley has just killed India’s cryptocurrency party,” Quartz’s article on the subject proclaims, citing a lawyer who expects “a legislative mechanism or... suitable amendment in existing legislation to ensure that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency is made illegal and to penalise entities and individuals who are involved in their trade and circulation.”On Twitter, the curious reading of Jaitley’s words continued, with declarations of Bitcoin being “illegal” and soon to be “eliminated.”Cryptocurrencies are illegal. Since they can't be traced.

Does this apply to currencies like:

- Old Rs. 500 note.
- Electoral Bonds?#Budget2018Bitcoin to be banned. Crypto currency illegal in India says @arunjaitley

Indian finance minister said it will eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in ""criminal use cases.""

Mainstream media took it as ""it will eliminate usage of cryptocurrencies"" and forgot the rest. pic.twitter.com/IXRwHSqZToIn line with previous government initiatives, Jaitley similarly produced no surprises with his commitment to expanding the use of Blockchain technology at the state level going forward.“The government will explore use of blockchain technology proactively for ushering in the digital economy,” he said in his speech."

The electricity supplier has been inundated with requests from cryptocurrency miners looking to setup operations in energy-rich province Quebec, according to Reuters.","Many miners, including giants like China-based Bitmain, have made it clear that they are looking to setup new mining operations overseas in countries with low power costs and surplus of energy. The crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges in China, as well as talks of power regulations applying to miners, has prompted miners to consider new sites to operate from.Bitmain told Reuters that it has been mining in Canada since 2016, although the location of their Canadian operation was not revealed.Ironically, Hydro Quebec may have to renege on its commercial power strategy - as forecasts show that they would not be able to meet the booming demand of industries looking to take advantage of the energy surplus in the province. The company is reviewing its plans after 70 cryptocurrency mining operators applied to set up shop in the province in the space of the week.Hydro Quebec claims to have a surplus of 100 terawatt hours over 10 years. As a reference, Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index estimates the combination of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash’s estimated annual electricity consumption around 31 terawatt-hoursThe utility supplier’s spokesman, Marc-Antoine Pouliot, told Reuters that the sheer number of companies looking to start cryptocurrency mining operations in the province is not sustainable, even with the surplus created by Hydro Quebec.“We are receiving dozens of demands each day. This context is prompting us to clearly define our strategy. We won’t be able to power all the projects that we’re receiving. This is evolving very rapidly so we have to be prudent.”The utility has also been actively attracting data centers to the province since 2016, citing the potential for job creation by these centers.In an earlier interview with Reuters, HQ business development director David Vincent said potential mining operators were looking at sites with energy demands ranging from those of data centers to that of power-hungry as metal smelting plants.Another stumbling block in the way of cryptocurrency operations being established is the lack of buildings ready for occupation."

Professor Kenneth S. Rogoff believes that the risk of financial anonymity will eventually create an environment where regulation would crush Bitcoin. He said:","“Small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies…would be desirable but large-scale anonymous payments would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.”The perspective is shared, though in a different vein, by the counterpart, Jeffrey A. Miron, whose Libertarian perspective makes him more lassez-faire. Nevertheless, he believes that central governments will eventually drive the technology out of existence. He said:“It [government] could let cryptocurrencies peacefully exist, and not accept them as a means of payment, and that’s what I think it should do. But my guess is that sooner or later governments are going to regulate cryptocurrencies out of existence.”The potential for government regulation is certainly real, as multiple nations have limited access to or exchange of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. China famously banned ICOs (initial coin offerings) and has restricted Bitcoin exchange access.It should also, of course, be remembered that Bitcoin is by no means anonymous. Users routinely make mistakes which weaken or eliminate Bitcoin’s psuedo-anonymity. As Cointelegraph has previously reported, the IRS has engaged the services of Blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to help them tax cheats who don’t report their Bitcoin profits."

We support Bitcoin because we see it as a long-term path towards greater financial access for all. This is a small step.

We also made this! https://t.co/z3u0liDNk4Since Square operates on a Point of Sale (PoS) network, the addition of BTC to its mobile services means that in the future any merchant that uses Square’s payment system will potentially be able to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.While the company says they will not add additional transaction fees for buying and selling BTC on the Cash App, the app calculates the price at which you can buy and sell from the quoted mid-market price, an average across major exchanges. According to Square’s site, users will be allowed to buy up to $10,000 in BTC a week, while there is no limit for selling.Square had previously announced in November 2017 that they would release a BTC trading option to a select 3 million customers, causing their stock to jump $1 billion in five days. Since the announcement Square’s stock had increased by more than 3 percent when it closed Wednesday, Jan. 31.Square’s announcement comes shortly after Robinhood, another trading app, announced that it would begin allowing users to trade in Bitcoin and Ethereum without fees starting in February.Coinbase, which charges transaction fees but has more users than brokerage firm Charles Schwab, has long been considered the most reliable exchange for crypto trading. With the addition of Robinhood and Square to the crypto trading sphere, with already more than 1 mln users on the waitlist for Robinhood’s crypto trading platform, it’s clear that the market for crypto trading applications is heading in a less centralized direction."

Europeans aged between 16 and 35 can also ask questions around three main topics: possibility of a new global economic crisis, cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, Europe’s economic recovery and youth unemploymentThe session is part of the ECB’s third Youth Dialogue which usually constitutes a series of talks held by the Bank’s policymakers with students and young people from different countries and backgrounds.As a prelude to the session, the ECB has launched a Twitter opinion poll to ask if Bitcoin could offer a viable alternative to traditional currencies. The poll by Europe’s top bank has received more than 15,500 responses in about 24 hours.While the role of central banks in the digital currency world has always been a subject of debate, the view that they exist to help ensure stability for economies still stands.Bitcoin’s volatility has earned criticism of being a vehicle for perpetrating fraud from the likes of Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of the US investment bank Goldman Sachs. Luxembourg's Finance Minister, Pierre Gramegna also suggested that the European Union could soon introduce new cryptocurrency regulations.What is clear is that 2017 was a crucial year for Bitcoin. Top digital currency soared in popularity globally as its value rose sharply, while crypto gained mainstream media’s attention.Though there is no evidence, such awareness increased its adoption in Europe, available statistical data about 2017 shows that its use as an every-day payment method in main European economies is still minimal.Nevertheless, it is obvious that new information has been dropped into the public domain for many people to sort on their own. It should make the ECB’s Q&A session to be an interesting watch even if nothing new is expected.The session is coming in the wake of the recent suspension of Bitcoin-backed Visa debit cards in Europe and proposed introduction of EU-wide regulation on such currencies. It’s also worth thinking what the outcome could mean for the affected payment processors who are reportedly in talks with alternate card issuers in Europe and for those seeking to set up a crypto/fiat bank that would be independent of traditional banks."

While some are launching their own ICOs, such as Kodak, others have merely tacked ‘Blockchain’ onto their name and seen success.","In a move that seems dangerously similar to what happened in the 90s with the dot-com boom, the ‘Blockchain revolution’  taken on by some companies requires careful scrutiny as much of it is smoke and mirrors.Speaking of smoke, the cannabis revolution that followed its legalization in a few states also came with a similar warning from the SEC about business cashing in on that hype.Among the host of companies trying to wrangle their way into the hyped market is the company formerly known as Tulip BioMed - now Bitcoin Services. This change in name and direction saw the company's stock increase by a massive 43,500 percent last year.To their credit, the name change came back in 2016 and only took off last year in November with the hype that came with the cryptocurrency market in the mainstream.Bitcoin Services financial filings from around that time offer few clues that the company was doing anything specific to justify the hysteria. The same can be said of its website, which generally lacks press releases and other investor information, apart from contact information.Bitcoin Services probably takes the top spot in terms of growth thanks to its name change, but there is a host of others that have made anywhere between 309 and 20,445 percent gains thanks to the change, as shown below.Another worrying trend that is reminiscent of the dot-com boom is that these gains do not last long as people quickly catch on or regulators step in.Hong Kong-based UBI Blockchain Internet—previously known as JA Energy—soared more than 20,000 percent before regulators halted buying and selling.Those who believe the entire cryptocurrency market is one big bubble often point to the similarities in hype between the dot-com bubble and these happen around companies taking advantage of the mania and speculation.It remains to be seen if the cryptocurrency market can weather this mania better than other similar bubbles."

The analysts agree that limited supply plays a big role in the price surge, but the social standing that comes with owning Bitcoin may also be causing investors to join the hype:“Bitcoins do not provide investors with cash-flows or other benefits, but the maximum supply of Bitcoins is fixed and so the price is driven by speculation on the potential demand for Bitcoin.”Just like high-end liquor, fancy cars and fashion brands, Bitcoin is acting like a Veblen good. The higher prices for certain goods can be attributed to the reinforcement of the social status attached to the product, something Bernstein calls “snob value.” The analysis added:“In mid-2017, we conducted a consumer survey of 1,070 Chinese Premium Goods Consumers which showed that Veblen Demand is the third most important motivator of brand choice in brands.”Bitcoin is perceived as difficult to understand for those who aren’t “in the know.” Thus, owning Bitcoin immediately gives one that “snob value,” implying greater intelligence or insight.In a strange, yet practical comparison, Bernstein compares Bitcoin to E.Jiao - traditional Chinese medicine derived from donkey skin. In 2016, China produced 5,000 tons of E.Jiao, which required 2.5 mln donkey skins. This has lead to a scarcity of donkey skins and cheap imitations coming to the market.The original product’s leading manufacturer - Dong E-E.Jiao - has been able to raise the price of its product 18 times over the last decade because of the Veblen good-quality that has become attached to it with its scarcity.While not necessarily a good, in the early 90s, with the dot-com boom, there was a certain social standing that came with being involved in a technology company. People were caught up in the hype partially because they wanted to be part of the early elite that were making waves in technology.It has already been seen that companies that simply add Blockchain to their name get huge waves of unjustified interest, and again, this could be likened to the social status that comes with being part of a company that is in the cryptocurrency space."

The traditional money market has been for so long an elitist environment that subtle excludes those who are not of its ilk.A thirty-something woman from the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda, does not exactly fit the bill of a savvy investor.

However, Bitcoin offers an alternative which is not time-consuming, and while it comes with risks, it is accessible and manageable.There are also businesses that are challenging the difficult and cutthroat workplace by using the power of Blockchain to cut costs and time.A company called BitPesa operates like a remittance company, transferring money across borders, but instead of using a medium like the US Dollar, they have opted for Bitcoin and its simple cross-border transfers.Elizabeth Rossiello, CEO of BitPesa, explains why this break with traditional banking is so effective in Africa.""I've been in Nairobi for the past month and I had three big banking things to do. All three of these operations with three different Kenyan banks were canceled for different reasons or had delays or needed additional information, so it took almost two and a half weeks per transaction to get them finalized and I'm an expert.""Clearly, with the banking system, even at its best, very outdated and causing many frustrations, in Africa, where it is already flawed and alternative needs to be sought.One issue that has been brought up before with an African revolution in Blockchain and Bitcoin is educating the masses on the disruptive technology.This has prompted some to get into the business of Bitcoin education.Martin Serugga, a trader in Kampala, has started weekly classes on Bitcoin which caters to about 50 people currently.His take on it harps back to the unemployment stating that the interest comes from those who are desperately seeking and failing, at getting jobs.""If you don't have factory jobs and you don't have corporate jobs to serve the thousands of young people coming out of the universities this is an alternative.”"

The small island population had to keep a virtual ledger of who owned what currency, because their units of value were large, almost unmoveable stones that would remain in one place, regardless of ownership, and could be lost at sea.The researchers then go into technical detail of the mechanisms of Bitcoin mining, the mathematics behind hashing, and how the transaction consensus works, touting the usefulness of Bitcoin as an asset of the future:“It is likely that cryptoassets such as Bitcoin will emerge as their own asset class and thus have the potential to develop into an interesting investment and diversification instrument. Bitcoin itself could over time assume a similar role as gold.”The paper then forecasts the areas in which Blockchain technology will have the most effective applications, citing “colored coins”, a kind of meta-transaction linked to a BTC transaction, smart contracts, an application in which Ethereum currently leads, and data integrity.The negatives of Blockchain technology applications, according to the researchers, are the potential for forks, the energy waste involved with mining, and the price volatility of a non-centralized currency.The paper’s conclusion again highlights the potential for a new digital currency asset class:“As an asset, however, Bitcoin and alternative blockchain-based tokens should not be neglected. The innovation makes it possible to represent digital property without the need for a central authority. This can lead to the creation of a new asset class that can mature into a valuable portfolio diversification instrument.”In January 2017, Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen spoke favorably of the possibility of the Fed using blockchain and the potential for easier global financial transactions, but offered no specifics as to how this could be implemented."

However, there are times when it fluctuates for obscure reasons.","According to some experts, the January downturn could be no surprise as he attributes it to the Lunar New Year and the significance it carries for the Chinese.The lead up to Chinese New Year is one of high spending as people book all sorts of travel and holidays, not to mention buy presents. Thus, just like Christmas and December is a time for spending in the West, January has a similar pattern in the east.With Bitcoin’s value almost halving from $20,000 in the middle of December to $10,000 at its worst in January, Wallin is both unperturbed or surprised.“The January drop is a recurring theme in cryptocurrencies as people celebrating the Chinese New Year, aka Lunar New Year, exchange their crypto for fiat currency,” explains Alexander Wallin, CEO of trading social network SprinkleBit, as quoted by Bloomberg.“The timing is about four to six weeks before the lunar year when most people make their travel arrangements and start buying presents,” he added.The holiday takes place on Feb. 16; however, the build-up is where people start to spend their money. And with the Chinese population heavily vested in Bitcoin, it has a huge role to play on the movement of the market.The thoughts are that people have been taking their profits into the build-up of the New Year, turning their Bitcoin into fiat currency to use for gift buying.Bitcoin is steadfast in the face of other market influences, the likes that are seen to disturb the traditional stock market, etc. But this theory, if it is to be believed, highlights the way in which Bitcoin moves separately from other assets.In August, when tensions between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un were reaching a fever pitch, the entire global market fell by an average of one percent. However, Bitcoin was one of the only assets to report growth during that period.While it may be hard to blame the market decline on something as otherworldly as the moon, there is some evidence to suggest that January is not a good time to be invested in Bitcoin.There are not too many patterns that have emerged in Bitcoin’s price graph over its short lifespan. However, there does seem to be some sort of correlation between this time of year.What is at least pleasing, if there is a pattern, is that a big rally often follows the January dip."

He does think, however, that the way the cryptocurrency was built is a “perfect storm for manipulation”.Belfort believes that the rising price of BTC can be attributed to wild speculation because of what he sees as improper use of the cryptocurrency:“Something [BTC] was designed to be used as a currency, and it’s being used as an investment vehicle [...] As a currency, Bitcoin is no more useful at $20,000 or $100.”Belfort spoke negatively about the potential for manipulating crypto markets due to the thinness of the market, specifically referencing the case of Olaf Carlson-Wee, an early adopter of BTC who was paid in crypto when working at Coinbase in 2013.According to Belfort, Carlson-Wee sold all of his Bitcoin, bought Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and then gave a televised interview saying that BTC was dead and that Bitcoin Cash was the future, causing its price to skyrocket.CT could not confirm that Carlson-Wee ever mentioned dumping all of his BTC for BCH, although he did give an interview to CNBC about Ethereum that some Reddit users misconstrued as Carlson-Wee moving all his holdings to Ether.Belfort predicts that while Bitcoin is, in his words, a “wolf in sheep’s clothing,”  it also “might go to $50,000” before what he is certain will be its eventual fall to zero.In September 2017, Belfort had said that Bitcoin was problematic because of the potential ease for hackers to steal virtual currency. In October, he commented that ICOs were the “biggest scams ever”.Belfort told Bet-David he had invested “not a penny” in cryptocurrency."

Dr James Andrew Butler, Co-founder and COO of digital asset platform Sharpe Capital told Cointelegraph:""The emergence of an increasingly large number of Blockchain service providers, and particularly those that reduce the technical barrier to entry for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, is an emphatic signal to the world of traditional banking and capital markets that Blockchain technology is not going anywhere. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrency currently sits at less than $600 billion, this is a tiny amount in the context of global capital markets. We’re beginning to see the earliest days of mainstream adoption – this is the internet in 1994.”The day before the announcement saw a major sell-off for Bitcoin, as prices plummeted below $10,000 for the first time since November 30. However, in just 48 hours, the market had rebounded and was back on its feet.At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $11,785, up 28% percent from the lows of the previous day."

“improvements” to Bitcoin, Core developers say. 46793 Total views.","Jan 19, 2018",Four Bitcoin developers have released a paper outlining how Schnorr multi-signatures (‘multisig’) can help scale the Bitcoin Blockchain.,"In the paper, published Jan. 15, Greg Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Yannick Seurin and Pieter Wuille discuss and illustrate how the technology, which ‘bunches’ multisig data together to reduce its size in a transaction, “could improve both performance and user privacy in Bitcoin.”Multisig has seen wide use in various applications for Bitcoin over the past several years. Its trademark security benefits are a principal feature of some consumer wallet applications, and this week’s paper pays attention to how Schnorr multisig also offers enhanced transaction privacy.Bitcoin scaling solutions continue to be in urgent demand as a variety of improvements move ever closer to mainstream acceptance.Chief among those in January is the Lightning Network, a so-called layer 2 protocol that facilitates near-zero-fee transactions for Bitcoin, processed almost instantly.Mainnet Lightning transactions are still in the “testing phase”, as Blockstream engineers put it in a post Jan. 16, and are happening on a small scale, with only around 50 nodes and 80 channels in operation.Schnorr signatures have long been a favorite for technical commentators, receiving praise   from Blockchain consultant Sam Wouters for security benefits last July. Wouters explained the significance of the technology in a post, saying:“At the end of the day, if it is just one person sending that transaction from multiple sources, there should be some way to do so with just one signature, right? This is what Schnorr signatures allow us to do.”"

traders the method they used to fund their cryptocurrency trading accounts.","Jan 7, 2018","According to LendEDU, a personal loan research firm, more than 18 percent of Bitcoin investors have used borrowed money to trade the cryptocurrency. In a global survey of 672 active Bitcoin investors, researchers asked traders the method they used to fund their cryptocurrency trading accounts. The majority of investors used banking systems such as credit cards and ACH transfers to fund their accounts.","But 22 percent of traders revealed that they have not paid off their credit and debit cards after purchasing Bitcoin, effectively investing in the cryptocurrency with borrowed money. The report read:“The wisest and most frugal way to fund a virtual currency exchange account would be through an ACH transfer, which is completely free of charge. Only 18.60 percent of our 672 Bitcoin-invested respondents were paying for the cryptocurrency in this fashion.However, this was not even the most pressing concern coming from the LendEDU poll. That recognition belongs to this data-point: 22.13 percent of Bitcoin investors did not pay off their credit card balance after purchasing Bitcoin.”Lately, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, revealed that it has been adding more than 250,000 active users on a daily basis, and were forced to stop adding new users temporarily as a result. Coinbase and Bitstamp have also been adding more than 100,000 users per day and at the time of reporting, Coinbase has close to 20 mln users.In early December, Bitstamp Co-founder and CEO Nejc Kodrič stated:“Please understand that we currently have over 100,000 new accounts opened daily. It is challenging to cope with such surge. We are expanding our capacity to onboard clients faster, but this takes a bit of time.”Hence, 618 Bitcoin users, is nowhere sufficient to create generalizations about the entire global Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market.But, it is important to acknowledge that a small portion of Bitcoin investors are still trading the cryptocurrency with debt to this date, despite the advice of experts and analysts to refrain from doing so.In June, Bitcoin and security expert Andreas Antonopoulos strongly emphasized that he only invests an amount in cryptocurrencies that he is willing to lose, given the significant risk involved in cryptocurrency trading. While the risk of investing in Bitcoin is lower than others given the size of its market, the risk for other cryptocurrencies in the global market still remains substantially high.“I own a few different crypto assets as part of a small but diversified portfolio. I only risk as much as I'm willing to lose,” said Antonopoulos.In a presentation at Coinscrum, an event hosted by the Imperial College London, Antonopoulos also noted that he can lose all of his investments in cryptocurrencies and still have everything else because he has invested his career, intellectual capacity, and work in Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market.For casual investors and newcomers, it is extremely risky to obtain debt to invest in a particular asset and this is not exclusive to Bitcoin. It does not matter which asset it is, becoming in debt to invest in a particular asset or asset class is highly risky.""My small savings that I do have are invested in Bitcoin. 100 percent [of it]. I actually have a tiny debt in US dollars that I'm still trying to pay off, so it is more than 100 percent in Bitcoin. Now, I'd like to emphasize again, that is not a recommendation to invest. Because I haven't invested my money in Bitcoin, I invested my career, my intellectual capacity, my creativity energy, my passion, and my work in Bitcoin. The money is the least of the investment that I have made in Bitcoin and I could lose everything of it and I'd still have everything else,” Antonopoulos explained."

Traditional stock investments, on the other hand, had allegedly fared better, with Ross giving the example of Boeing’s 200% gains since 2016.As Zerohedge notes, reproducing the unedited version of the exchange, Ross had failed to note Bitcoin’s annual gains of over 1000% in 2017 alone. Nathan labeled him “glib” to deride it.“You’ve been wrong, so don’t say that I’m glib,” Ross retorted before Nathan weighed in with the fateful remark:“You don't know what I've done, you don't know what my call is, so go piss off, seriously.”The episode continues Fast Money’s somewhat bizarre approach to Bitcoin reporting.

An analytical overview on ...","Feb 2, 2018","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.There are various reasons behind the panic currently gripping the crypto world – increased regulations, hacking, and crackdown by various governments. Additionally, the last leg of the rally looked frothy as traders gobbled up cryptocurrencies at crazy levels out of fear of missing out on the rally.But when the mainstream media highlights negative news, investor sentiment is affected and some traders panic and dump their positions out of fear of losing their capital.Some analysts believe that the bubble in cryptocurrencies has burst, while the others believe that the current fall is a great long-term buying opportunity.We consider the recent fall as a great buying opportunity. However, all cryptocurrencies will not rise equally from their current levels, as markets will start distinguishing between different cryptocurrencies.Therefore, we should look to buy stronger currencies that have fallen less and are bouncing off sharply from their key support levels.Let’s explore which cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a pullback.Bitcoin is in a firm bear grip. It has declined about 55 percent from its high. With the recent fall, the cryptocurrency has retraced close to 78.6 percent of the latest leg of the rally. We find first signs of buying at $8000 levels.In 2017, the RSI fell to the oversold levels (about 30) on three occasions and all of them proved to be a good buying opportunity. Presently, the RSI is close to the oversold levels. Therefore, there is a greater likelihood of a bottom formation around the current levels.Aggressive traders can buy between $8,600 to $8,600 and keep a stop loss of $7,800. The pullback can lift the BTC/USD pair to the overhead resistance of about $10,700.We anticipate another round of selling in the resistance zone of $10,700 to $11,300 (at the 20-day EMA). Therefore, traders should book partial profits at $10,500 levels and trail the rest. This is a risky trade and should be attempted with less than 50 percent of the usual position size.The next leg down will confirm a bottom in the cryptocurrency, if it doesn’t break the recent lows of $8,000. If the lows break, the downtrend can extend to $6,000 levels. Therefore, we recommend that long-term traders should wait for a couple of days before buying.  Our stop loss on the long positions in Ethereum was hit at $1,000. It could not escape the panic that has gripped the cryptocurrency market.Today, the ETH/USD pair broke below the uptrend line, the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA. It finally took support at $768, just below the panic low of $770 hit on January 17 2018.The pullback from the lows is likely to face resistance at $1,025 levels. At the current levels, the risk to reward ratio is not attractive. Therefore, we are not recommending making any trades on this currency.However, if the next fall towards the $820 to $770 level holds, we suggest long positions with a SL at $700.  Bitcoin Cash has completely retraced the last leg of the rally. It has slumped about 73 percent from its peak.  In our previous analysis, we forecasted that if the $1,364.9657 level breaks, a fall to $1,150 is likely and that is what happened. The cryptocurrency fell to a low of $1,000 where buying emerged.The pullback can carry the BCH/USD pair to the downtrend line, where we anticipate another round of selling.Bitcoin Cash has been a laggard; hence, we want to see a further confirmation of a bottom formation before recommending any trade. We are most likely to recommend a long position if the support zone of $1,150 to $1,000 holds during the next fall.Ripple has taken the current fall on the chin. At the day’s intraday low of $0.61, it had declined 81.5 percent from lifetime highs of $3.317.The momentum was so strong that the critical support level of $0.87, which had acted as a strong support on January 16 and January 17 also failed.The XRP/USD pair fell close to the next support level of $0.61, which is the final support, below which, a fall to $0.24 is likely.The current pullback should reach the downtrend line which should offer a strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive, so we don’t suggest any trade on it.         Stellar has broken below the 50-day EMA. At the days intraday it also broke below $0.41 and fell towards the final support of $0.296.Strong buying at the lower levels helped the cryptocurrency pull back above the critical support of $0.41. If the level holds, we may see a range bound action on the XLM/USD pair for the next few days.Steller will likely become a buy once it breaks out of the upper end of the range at $0.64.We are not recommending a buy today because a pullback of a single day cannot confirm a bottom.After breaking the critical support of $175, the bulls failed to hold the $140.001 levels and  Litecoin fell to a low of $107.102.Strong buying at the lows is likely to carry the LTC/USD pair towards the overhead resistance of $175.However, the cryptocurrency has been weak and its logical support is way lower at $84.708. Therefore, we don’t recommend any long positions on it.  NEM has declined about 74 percent from the highs. It has found some buying support at $0.45747, just below the critical level of $0.49.The pullback should reach the downtrend line, which should offer strong resistance. The risk to reward ratio is not attractive and the XEM/USD pair has been an underperformer. Therefore, we want to wait for a further confirmation of a bottom before cherry picking.During the next retest of the low, if the $0.45 level breaks, a slide down to the next support of $0.3672 is likely.NEO broke below the symmetrical triangle on February 1 2018. Today (February 2), it fell close to the critical support level of $93.53 which resulted in strong buying by the bulls.The pullback in the NEO/USD pair has reached close to the breakdown point of $132, which should offer a strong resistance level.NEO is one of the stronger cryptocurrencies in the top 10 list because it is still quoting above the 50-day SMA.We consider that it might be better to buy NEO during the next fall to $105 levels.We were expecting the trendline to provide some support, but the bears easily broke down below it. EOS found buying support at the $8.4 levels, close to the critical support zone of $7.5 to $6.5.The EOS/USD pair is comparatively strong because it is also quoting above its 50-day SMA. Aggressive traders can buy on any dips towards $9 and keep a SL of $7.4.The profit objective on the upside is a rally to $14 levels.We recommend that the long-term traders, however, should wait for a buy set up to form before initiating any long positions.Note: - Bottoms are not formed in a single day. After such a steep decline, we are likely to see a pullback and a few days of volatile price action. Therefore, we have suggested only a few trades and that too only for the aggressive trader.The long-term traders should wait for a successful retest of the lows before buying.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange; the charts for the analysis are provided by TradingView."

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.","After a bumper 2017, the cryptocurrency market is attracting new traders who wish to make a fortune in short time. While this is a bullish development, it is also fraught with risk. Most newbies entering the markets believe that it is a ‘get rich quick’ scheme.However, a majority will end up investing in coins that are likely to vanish from the scene in a few years. Too many inexperienced traders willing to buy at any price can lead to a bubble, which will end with a sharp downturn that does not bounce back quickly.Hope, we are smart enough to identify the bear market beforehand and emerge with minimum losses. Traders should always keep an eye on the risk so that they can last in this business for the long-term.  Bitcoin could not sustain above $17,000 levels, which encouraged profit booking and selling at the higher levels. It has broken below the 20-day EMA and the trendline support, hitting our trailing stop loss at $15,000.If the bears can sustain below $15,000, the cryptocurrency will become negative and extend its fall to $14,000. Below this level, the 50-day SMA is the last major support, which has not been broken convincingly since end-September.Therefore, if the bears succeed in sustaining below the 50-day SMA, it will indicate weakness.The head and shoulders pattern is still intact and if the price breaks below the neckline, traders should brace themselves for lower levels, even below $10,000.Our bearish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair takes support and turns around from any of the above-mentioned support levels and breaks out of $17,200 levels.Ethereum broke out of the ascending channel yesterday, Jan. 7, and rose to $1,191 levels, where it witnessed profit booking. We had mentioned $1,200 as one of the possible targets in our previous analysis. If bulls manage to break out of $1,200, the next target on the upside is $1,310, which is arrived at by adding the width of the channel to the breakout point of the channel.  However, currently, the price has turned down and has entered into the channel once again, which is a negative sign. Levels that can offer support are $993.91 and $933.03, which are 38.2 percent and 50 percent retracement levels of the latest leg of the rally.If the bulls fail to propel the ETH/USD pair back above the channel quickly, we most likely see a fall to $820, which is the trendline support of the channel increase.Bitcoin Cash could not break out of the $2,800 levels yesterday, Jan. 7. As a result, it has now formed a range between $2,291 and $2,770.6933.The lower end of the range has held on four occasions. If it holds again, we are likely to witness a few more days of range-bound trading.But if the range breaks down, it is likely to attract further selling, which can sink the BCH/USD pair to the 50-day SMA, close to $2,000.    For the past three days, Ripple has been trading inside the large range formed on Jan. 5. The support on the downside is between $2.13492, the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level, and $2.15777, the low on Jan. 5.On the upside, resistance lies at $2.849, $3.06 and $3.317.As mentioned earlier, we expect the XRP/USD pair to fall to about $1.4 levels eventually and remain range bound for the next few days.It’ll prove to be wrong if the price breaks out to new lifetime highs.     On Jan. 7, IOTA again failed to sustain above the overhead resistance at $4.34. We hold long positions initiated at $3.904 and $4.121.As the bulls have failed to sustain above $4.34 on three occasions, we believe that the bears are likely to push the cryptocurrency down to the lower end of the range.Our current suggested stop loss is at $2.85. Although considering the weakness in Bitcoin and most other top currencies, we recommend raising our stop loss to $3.5.We shall initiate long positions again when the IOTA/USD pair falls to the bottom of the range at $3.032.    The attempts by the bulls to resume the uptrend in Litecoin hit a wall on Jan. 6, at $307.992.After the stellar rally from $84.708 to $370, the cryptocurrency has entered a period of correction/consolidation and has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern.  A breakout from the triangle and the overhead resistance at $307.992 is likely to resume the uptrend in the cryptocurrency.On the other hand, a breakdown from the triangle will be bearish, which can result in a sharp fall if the price breaks below $175.199.As long as the LTC/USD pair trades inside the triangle, it is likely to remain volatile and trendless.We had recommended a long position at $1.072 expecting a retest of the highs. Yet, NEM could only reach a high of $1.9.Like all other cryptocurrencies, the XEM/USD pair has also turned down sharply. It is likely to break below our stop loss of $1.4 and fall towards the trendline. If the trendline support breaks, a fall to $0.795 is likely.   On the upside, the bulls will face a stiff resistance between $1.9 and the lifetime highs.After the large range day on Jan. 5, Cardano remained in a small range on Jan. 6 and Jan.7.Today, the cryptocurrency has turned down. Its immediate support is at 0.00005347, which is the low reached Jan. 5. If this level breaks, the fall can extend to the 20-day EMA.However, if the ADA/BTC pair holds the support levels, we may see another attempt to resume the uptrend. Any long positions should only be initiated once the price breaks out of 0.00006655.The market data is provided by TradingView."

According to Business Wire, this is a first for the online sports gaming community.Fantasy sports have become massively popular around the world and FanDuel CFO Andy Giancamilli says the incentive to offer Bitcoin as a reward is a step towards the future, as cryptocurrencies move into mainstream acceptance.“FanDuel has always sought to deliver the most unique and rewarding experiences or prizes to our users,” said FanDuel CFO Andy Giancamilli.“In awarding Bitcoin, we’re recognizing that most of our users are early adopters of technology and have a significant interest in cryptocurrency. Our fans love the prizing aspect of playing on our site and we think this will be a reward that they truly appreciate.”Fantasy league players can enter a free-to-play contest which rewards one Bitcoin to the winner of the ‘Bitcoin Bowl Free Play.’The ‘Bitcoin Bowl Tournament,’ a multi-entry competition costing $3 per entry, offers the winner two Bitcoin in reward. Finishing in second place offers 0.5 Bitcoin while third and fourth place will get 0.25 Bitcoin each.A player must select a full fantasy starting team comprising of one quarterback, one kicker, one tight end, one defense as well as three wide receivers and two running backs. The different players have different scoring opportunities that are recorded during a game, as per this guide from Rotogrinders.The wildcard round of the NFL playoffs got underway on Jan. 6.First up, the Tennessee Titans beat the Kansas City Chiefs 22-21 while the Atlanta Falcons beat the Los Angeles Rams 26-13.The Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Buffalo Bills 10-3 while the New Orleans Saints beat the Carolina Panthers 31-26 on Jan. 7."

in growth market for pen collectibles. 19868 Total views. 167 Total ...","Jan 8, 2018","Alongside your investments in stocks, gold and Bitcoin, have you considered adding a writing instrument to your investment portfolio? While Italian pen-maker Ancora and digital moneymaker Bitcoin may seem to have little in common, the value of both assets is based on the economic concept of scarcity. Both the pen-maker and the digital moneymaker produce a limited stock (only 21 mln Bitcoins will be minted). The scarcer an asset, the higher its demand, and as demand increases so should its value.","Ancora has well understood the concept of scarcity since its inception in 1919 along Lake Maggiore in Italy. The maker of fountain pens and ballpoint pens produces its fine pens in limited editions.
Its latest special edition pen is the Bitcoinpen. If you are considering investing in one of Ancora’s 88 Bitcoin fountain pens or 888 Bitcoin rollerball pens, here are five reasons why fountain pens are an attractive investment.Typically produced with gold and other precious materials, like gold, fountain pens can act as a safe haven investment. In addition to the quality of materials, investors value these fine writing instruments based on their rarity (limited editions), reputation and design themes.Fine writing instruments are considered luxury collectibles that can retain and appreciate in value. With high sentimental value, fountain pens are passed on to future generations in wills. Those pens not kept as mementos may end up at auction houses as part of estate sales. Auction houses such as Christie’s and Southeby’s regularly have fountain pens for sale under $200, but it is not uncommon for a pen to sell for thousands of dollars.Rarity is highly valued. The most expensive pens are typically part of special limited editions. One of 20 Ancora The Pulse of Time Square Limited Edition fountain pens is currently selling on eBay for $8,800, a seven-fold increase since the pens were introduced in 2015 and sold for $1,200 a piece. The pen contains mother of pearl, gold and silver.Unlike many speculative assets, the value of pens may be backed by their materials. Currently among the world’s most expensive pens is a limited edition Boehme Papillon pen by Montblanc with 1,400 diamonds and gold selling for $230,410. A true rarity, a gem-encrusted pen made by Florentine pen-maker Tibalidi recently sold for $8 mln in Shanghai. Rare materials are an increasingly popular feature, with current offerings including rhodium, ruthenium, titanium and Ancora’s Minerals series (e.g., azurite and diopside). Newer designer Romain Jerome is selling a $5,000 pen (88 pieces) made from materials from the doomed Titanic ship.Fountain pens have timeless appeal. As gifts, many writing instruments are ordered with a  custom monogram to personalize the pen. When the monogram belongs to a famous personality, a pen can become very valuable in the secondary market. Like watches, heritage adds a premium to fountain and ballpoint pens. When the near century-old Ancora went out of business in the 1970s for a decade, its pens became more valuable owing to its enduring reputation as a quality Italian maker of fine fountain pens.While fountain pens have benefited from trends, including the vintage trend, long-term sustainable trends are now supporting the growth in sales. The environmentally conscious consumer is buying long-lasting ballpoint and fountain pens in place of disposable pens. Backed by the greening consumer, this trend is expected to remain positive and strong.Writing your great novel with the Ancora custom designed Jules Verne pen, your screenplay with the Michelangelo pen or your song lyrics with the Signorelli pen can add inspiration and sentimental value to the writing experience. Fountain pens are commonly designed after famous personalities, including those from the literary, art, entertainment, sports and religious worlds.As with any investment, researching the market can lead to better investment decisions. Japanese-themed pens of Dunhill-Namiki, for example, have done particularly well. Bonhams.com currently has an Emperor Tanabata theme, inspired by a well-loved folktale, selling for between $45,000 and $65,000. Five pens have been produced. Another Dunhill-Namiki pen signed by artist Shogo recently sold for $225,000—one of a number of 1930s era pens signed by Japanese artists selling at high prices.Above all, cherished brands hold value in the luxury collectibles market. The Ancora Bitcoinpens can be purchased at half their retail price during the current production stage running from Jan. 5 to Jan. 26. The Bitcoin fountain pens normally retail for $2,500 and the rollerball pen $2,250.Catherina Leona, Guest AuthorDisclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

He made his comments in an exclusive interview with Fox Business at the JPMorgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco.In September 2017 at a banking conference, Dimon called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" and said that he would fire any JPMorgan employee who traded Bitcoin on the company’s accounts, in part for being “stupid”.He also told Fox Business today that he “regrets” making the September comments, but is “not interested that much in the subject at all.”However, despite his lack of interest, Dimon made an ambiguous statement about the government’s relationship to Bitcoin, telling Fox Business:“The bitcoin to me was always what the governments are gonna feel about bitcoin as it gets really big, and I just have a different opinion than other people.”Though it is unclear exactly what Dimon intended to say with these words, in the context of his earlier comments on the subject from 2015, he may have meant that cryptocurrency would eventually become fully government-controlled.In 2015, responding to a question about the potential for a decentralized “shadow economy” of cryptocurrencies, Dimon stated more clearly:“It’s just not gonna happen, you’re wasting your time. This is my personal opinion. There will be no real non-controlled currency in the world. There’s no government that’s gonna put up with it for long.”During the Jan. 9 interview with Fox, Dimon asserted, as he did in 2015, that the viable digital currencies will be those that are government-backed, or fiat, such as a digital yen or dollar:“You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that. ICO's you have to look at individually.”Dimon seemed optimistic about Blockchain technology, noting:“The blockchain is real.”In 2017, multiple governments around the world announced that they were considering implementing a national digital currency. Others, such as Venezuela, have already done so.An earlier version of this article implied that Dimon's 2015 statements were in fact made Jan. 9, 2018. The text has been edited to clarify timing. We apologize for any confusion."

He also predicted that BTC could become an apolitical standard of value.","Casares, who grew up in Patagonia, Argentina, explained during the interview that he had seen his family lose everything three times during his childhood due to banking failures and hyperinflation. He, like many tech pundits, compares the creation of Blockchain technology to the creation of the Internet in terms of its innovative potential.Earlier this year, Casares had predicted that the price of Bitcoin would eventually reach $1 mln. During the Jan. 12 interview, Casares repeated the same prediction, but in a modified form, calling Bitcoin and crypto in general an “interesting experiment” and predicting BTC’s $1 mln price if that experiment should succeed:“I also think that there is a higher than 50% chance that this experiment succeeds...If that happens the world is going to look very very different... I happen to believe that if it succeeds that one bitcoin is going to be worth one million dollars.”He also said he thinks there is an “at least a 20 percent chance that this experiment fails”.Casares’s optimistic views on the digital currency, however, are bigger than price gains:“I can imagine a world in which bitcoin becomes a global standard of value — it’s the first global and non-political standard of value — coupled with the first global and non-political standard of settlement [...] It would be the biggest leap forward in the democratization of money we’ve ever seen.”According to Casares, the future of crypto lies in the cooperation around a singular, robust Blockchain, and in his opinion Bitcoin’s is the most likely to be the Blockchain of choice:“There is a huge incentive to have one very, very robust blockchain. At least for any process that, in the end, will be moving value of any kind [...] There may be other use cases that do not entail value that may merit a different blockchain, but in terms of value, it’s most likely, in my opinion, that we’re going to have one. And right now, the most likely one seems to be the Bitcoin blockchain.”Casares’s focus on Bitcoin underlines the importance of miners being able to successfully rely on transaction fees as incentives to replace block rewards, once the 21 mln Bitcoin mining cap is reached. 80 percent of bitcoins had already been mined on Jan. 13, leaving 4.2 mln coins left until the supply cap."

Impossible To Predict. In an interview with CT at Blockchain Connect, 
Litecoin ...","Feb 2, 2018","Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin (LTC) and former Director of Engineering at Coinbase, has taken some bold steps recently in the crypto world.","In December, Lee announced in a Reddit post that he had sold and donated all of his LTC, citing a conflict of interest. In January, Lee tweeted a proposal for a Litecoin soft fork that would allow for a new type of fee market to develop for the altcoin.  Lee was a keynote speaker at the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco on Jan. 26, where Cointelegraph had the chance to talk to him backstage about the then-breaking Coincheck exchange hack news, cryptocurrency adoption, and the importance of keeping perspective in a market as volatile as crypto.CHARLIE: Funny, I was just reading a Cointelegraph article [on the Coincheck exchange hack]. Did this just happen right now?CT: Yes, it happened this morning [Jan. 26]. So what are your first thoughts on the Coincheck hack?CHARLIE: My first thought is it’s unfortunate that the exchange got hacked. I mean, it’s not unexpected. But I think this is just the nature of the game.Freedom of money means that you have full control over your money, and if you give control away to an exchange, then they have the control over the money and they can easily lose it.This probably won’t be the last time we hear about an exchange getting hacked. But this is definitely one of the largest hacks that I remember in terms of percentage of the coins out there. NEM is 8 billion dollars [NEM market cap].So, it’s 6-7 percent [*5.8 percent] of all the coins out there that got hacked. And if it was a Proof-of-Stake coin, it becomes very susceptible to an attack if the hacker wants to use that coin to attack the network. [*NEM is Proof of Importance]So we’ve seen blockchains like VeriCoin actually revert the blockchain. Or even Ethereum did it with the DAO hack, where they reverted and they took the money back and gave it back to the rightful owners. So that’s the first thing I thought of. Are they going to do a hard fork to take the money back.CT: We were just talking about whether or not NEM would do a hard fork.CHARLIE: Yeah. And for Bitcoin and Litecoin this is something I would never encourage or promote, doing a hard fork to take the money back.The base layer needs to be censorship resistant. Developers or companies cannot unilaterally decide to reverse transactions. Once you draw the line of doing that, where do you stop?So, I’m just taking guesses; I’m not sure what they are thinking right now. But it’s unfortunate for the exchange and the people who had coins on the exchange.[On Jan. 27, Coincheck announced that it would refund all users affected by the hack. The NEM team is opposed to conducting a hard fork and has since reported that the hackers are now moving some of the stolen coins to different addresses]CT: So your position is: “It’s unfortunate, but if you put your money in the hands of someone else, as in a third party, then this is the risk you take”?CHARLIE: Yes. It’s by nature. You have control over your money: if you want to give that control away to other people, then there’s definitely a risk involved.And, in most cases, the risk is worth it if you want to trade on centralized exchanges. And hopefully we’ll see more decentralized exchanges this year.CT: Do you think the recent introduction of cryptocurrency trading options into the Robinhood app shows that crypto trading is on the rise?CHARLIE: I think things like Robinhood and Square Cash adopting Bitcoin — letting people buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies — is definitely a very good sign of slowly moving towards mainstream adoption. So I think it’s very good, I’m very excited about it.Especially the fact that Robinhood could potentially support Litecoin in the future. It makes it easy for the average person to get into the space, to get exposure to the coin, easily buy a small amount of it and use it.This is something that Coinbase has been doing for many years, and also the reason why I joined Coinbase to help make this happen — to help make Bitcoin and Litecoin and other coins just easy to use for the average person, for moms and dads.CT: Why did you end up eventually leaving Coinbase?CHARLIE: I left to focus on Litecoin. I’m spending full-time on Litecoin development right now.CT: But you sold all your stake in that?CHARLIE: I did sell my coins, but I’m still full-time on Litecoin development. I sold my coins due to conflicts of interest and not because I didn’t believe in the project.CT: Do you think that any person who owns or works full-time on a cryptocurrency shouldn’t have any stake in their own coin?CHARLIE: No, not necessarily. I think I’m in a special position because I have such a large social media presence, and I have huge influence on the future of Litecoin and price movement of Litecoin, so I’ve always felt a bit conflicted when I’m promoting Litecoin on social media and see that affect the price. Also the fact it is helping me financially — so I kind of wanted to remove the financial aspect from my work.CT: In the very first panel this morning the CEO of Kraken, Jesse Powell, said that, “If you feel that your psychology is being manipulated by the chart you’re looking at, then you should just trade the fundamentals. You don’t have to trade the chart.”Do you think that a single person on Twitter can really manipulate the market that much?CHARLIE: I think it’s just human nature that people get influenced quite a bit by what they hear and see around them.Long term, I’m very bullish for Litecoin and Bitcoin price-wise, but for short-term fluctuations it can move drastically in either direction and it’s hard to predict.CT: Do you have any particular predictions for the next year for either Bitcoin or Litecoin?CHARLIE: It’s impossible to predict. That’s why I don’t do any predictions. Last year before the rise, when Litecoin was at $4, I told myself that if Litecoin hits $30, it would be a great year. I mean, it’s amazing, right? If it goes from $4 to $30, that’s almost a nine times increase. That’s amazing returns.But it went to $300, ten times more than that [$30].But then it also surprises me on the downside....even Bitcoin went up to $1200 in the last peak [in 2013], but dropped all the way down to $200 [in 2015]. That’s an 80 percent drop in price.That’s also why I made a tweet late last year saying that if you can’t handle Litecoin going to $20 from the high, then don’t invest in it.Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit...

Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy! ?A lot of people who lose money are the ones that get in on the high or somewhere in the middle. Then the price drops by a lot and then they have to sell it because it’s too much money for them to lose. So, they sell at the low and then they don’t catch the rise back up.People misread that [tweet] and thought that I was telling them to sell because it’s [Litecoin] going to drop 90 percent. I mean, it could. But I’m just raising the possibility that it’s too volatile and you shouldn’t bet more than you can risk that you’ll lose. Long term is good, short-term – no one knows.CT: Thank you so much! We really appreciate it. Very nice to meet you.  This interview was conducted in collaboration with Cointelegraph news editor, Olivia Capozzalo.*Note from the Cointelegraph editorial team"

Considering the preeminent cryptocurrency was available for less than $100 for at least four years, early investors will have got their hands on hundreds and thousands of Bitcoin before its meteoric rise in value.The list of supposed Bitcoin billionaires puts a spotlight on the biggest holders of the virtual currency, but there are likely to be thousands of people holding onto a small fortune in Bitcoin.Many early adopters like to promote the ‘hodl’ lifestyle, refusing to sell any of their Bitcoin at any cost. It's hard to argue against them having seen the rise of Bitcoin over the past 12 months.However, early Bitcoin investor and well-known venture capitalist Fred Wilson insists that investors with a large amount of Bitcoin would be wise to practice profit taking, as reported by CNBC this week.“If you are sitting on 20x, 50x, 100x your money on a crypto investment, it would not be a mistake to sell 10 percent, 20 percent or even 30 percent of your position. Selling 25 percent of your position on an investment that is up 50x is booking a 12.5x on the entire investment while allowing you to keep 75 percent of it going. I know that many crypto holders think that selling anything is a mistake. And it might be. Or it might not be. You just don’t know.”Wilson posted the advice on his personal blog, in a post grappling with the difficulties of managing a venture capitalist portfolio. The 56-year-old is the founder of Union Square Ventures, which has stakes in a number of technology companies including the likes of Twitter.Wilson’s sentiments come at an interesting juncture. The past three weeks have been tumultuous for the cryptocurrency market. Marred by volatility, the markets have seen wild price fluctuations with many virtual currencies affected.Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are caught in a massive bull vs. bear market, as investors look to book profits and stop losses as often as possible.Nevertheless, Wilson offers some sage advice ahead of an exciting 2018, as more mainstream financial institutions iron out plans to enter the market in different ways. The CBE and CMOE have blazed the trail for Bitcoin Futures, and the likes of the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ and Goldman Sachs are all preparing to launch their own offerings in the next few months.Coupled with the massive influx of users looking to open cryptocurrency accounts, the outlook seems bright, even amidst constantly changing market values."

A Swiss University kick-started the trend, but when it comes to Africa, this represents a giant leap forward.African citizens have forever battled against the colonial system that has left them scrambling to keep up, both in terms of finance and education. While the level of education continues to rise, it is developments like this, with digital currencies such as this, that marks a potential for Africans to do some leapfrogging.The fact that digital currencies do not discriminate, nor have any prejudice when it comes to their use, makes them not only ideal for a youthful market, but also one for those who have been let down badly by western-style Banks.Business schools, tertiary education centers and universities alike are essentially in place to prepare students for the future, and to this end, there is an integration of a potentially global future currency that seems at home in this setting.Bitcoin, as the leader in the adoption of digital currencies, is not only an interesting case study and sector for study - with regards to the Blockchain - but it is making its real-world impact felt with those who could be shaping the future.“The world is changing rapidly, as are our students and it’s our responsibility to ensure we are serving their future-focused needs,” said Rob Stokes, chairman of Red & Yellow and founder of digital agency pioneer, Quirk.While Wall Street and other institutionalized money investors may be chanting ‘bubble’ whenever Bitcoin is mentioned, the youth of today thinks differently.To that end, Quirk has noted that this market, of students and youngsters who are venturing into investing with Bitcoin as their first time, should be given a chance to use their earnings.“The reality is that Bitcoin is here to stay and with many youngsters having made a good return on their investment in cryptocurrencies, they now want to use this digital cash to invest in their education, as future leaders.”It is not only a positive for students to be able to pay for their education with Bitcoin, but it is good for the faculty.Youngsters who may never have had a college fund or even money to go to university now have a direct route in which to spend any gains they have accrued from savvy investing.Professor. John Simpson, former head of management studies at UCT, who is now leading the same faculty at Red & Yellow, said:“Not only will this make our offerings more accessible to the public – individuals and organizations – but it will set us apart on an international scale, regardless of the market.”A trend seems to be developing in this space which caters for what must be cryptocurrencies’ biggest market - the 18 to 20-somethings. Those entering university are the majority in an age bracket that are firstly drawn to cryptocurrencies, and secondly, a bracket that is shaping the future.It would go hand in hand then that tertiary education centers make their services available in Bitcoin as they have the captive market, and that market is economically freeing themselves through digital currencies."

electricity vary greatly in different countries. 92950 Total views. 533 
Total shares.","Feb 2, 2018","This idea that simply plugging your computer or nowadays, specialized mining rigs into the Internet and making money out of thin air is extremely attractive. However, it is obviously not as simple as it sounds, and the mining sector is one that has become very competitive and sophisticated.","Despite this individuals who are interested in mining can still join in, and by narrowing their margins, there is the potential to make a decent profit. It all comes down to cheap resources though, and in the case of mining, that resource is electricity. The disparity between electricity prices around the world means that mining one Bitcoin in a certain country can be many times more profitable than doing the same thing across the border.The image below shows a list of countries and the average cost in USD to mine a single Bitcoin. This study, conducted by Elite Fixtures, was put together using consumption required to mine a Bitcoin averaged from three different mining rigs — the AntMiner S7, the AntMiner S9 and the Avalon 6.The study sourced its electricity price data provided by each country’s government and local utility companies, as well as the International Energy Agency, IBTimes reports.So, with this data available, suddenly mining across the globe starts to make sense. The best place to make profits mining a single Bitcoin is in Venezuela. The process costing only about $530.With the current Bitcoin price hovering around $10,000, this has the potential for a massive rate of return for South American miners. Additionally, given the country’s economic and political climate, it is not surprising to see that many Venezuelans have taken advantage of mining. Not only is it pertinent to mine in Venezuela in times of peace, the South Americans have utilized this cheap electricity in times of crisis with their own currency inflating to useless proportions.A lot of countries in Western Europe (such as Germany and Denmark) are ranked as some of the most expensive places to try and pull Bitcoin out of the ether. In fact, in the current climate, mining a Bitcoin in either of the aforementioned countries would end up costing you $4,000.The mining dispersion across the globe also clearly follows the lines of cheap electricity as a study done by Cambridge University last year showed that countries in the Far East, especially China, held the title of mining capitals of the world.The power that China, and even Russia, hold as mining super powers comes almost directly from the price of their electricity. China, according to the study, sits at a modest $3,172 per coin which is still, currently, a 70 percent return.China has also been profiting from the government being open to letting the miners use excess power in the country, but this has recently come under scrutiny. The Chinese government is now trying to crack down on all facets of cryptocurrency, which has them looking at mining.Russia, another super power that is benefiting from relatively cheap electricity (which sits at $4,675 per Bitcoin), as well as subsidies from the government, could soon be under regulation and stricter control.As electricity is one of the first expenses that will need to be considered when setting up mining, it makes sense for major mining setups to consider the above low-cost countries to be an attractive prospect. However, as Bitcoin continues to grow, regulators are looking to take aim at different sectors, including mining.There may be other countries where the electricity is more expensive, but regulations around mining and cryptocurrencies are a lot lighter, for example, Japan. There are also certain mining pools and even ICOs that are looking at setting up their operations near green sources of renewable power to try and lessen the expense and the load not only on their wallet, but on the environment as well."

The result is that institutional investors, who are supposed to value assets using their sophisticated financial literacy, analysis, and information-gathering strengths, are actually seeking feedback about the market from cryptocurrency prices (which are mainly formed by retail investors).""Muraki’s main point is that as long as volatility in the stock market is decreasing, the price of BTC and other mainstream cryptocurrencies will continue to rise as investors continue to turn to the crypto market to make money.While markets for traditional assets are currently relatively predictable, the crypto market is anything but stable. After breaking $20,000 per coin in mid-December 2017, BTC crashed to down below $10,000 on Jan. 17.BTC is currently trading at an average of $11,834, down 1.02 percent over the 24 hours to press time."

Market capitalization amplifies an asset’s value by that asset’s overall amount in circulation. The spike occurred as a result of the increase in the value of more than 1,400 cryptocurrencies in use.","Considering the growth opportunity, traders and investors are starting to get more involved in the crypto world. Now, more than ever, people are looking at cryptocurrencies from an investment perspective. However, crypto investing doesn’t compare to picking stocks on e-Trade because e-Trade is a third party between the Stock Exchange and an investor. Intermediaries or third parties don’t exist when trading on decentralized exchanges.A young, driven company CoinSpark with a business model focused on its investors and traders aims to become a new type of decentralized digital asset exchange. It enters the scene in the attempt to reward the crypto community in the form dividends issued proportionally to all SPARK coin holders. The goal is to develop a decentralized digital asset exchange where customers receive 25 percent of the company's net profits.Another core benefit of the CoinSpark business model is linked to its physical location. Considering speculations are surrounding the fate of crypto exchanges in South Korea, CoinSpark may become a safe haven for foreign investors. Located in the Cayman Islands, the company is fully licensed and could potentially become a “refuge” for investors and traders affected by a potential South Korean crypto exchange ban.To ensure a smooth development of the trading platform, CoinSpark partnered with AlphaPoint, a fintech company that turns illiquid assets into liquid assets, enabling its customers to launch products and services by offering other companies and institutions Blockchain-based solutions to launch markets, digitize assets and reduces operational costs at an enterprise level. With customers across five continents and office in San Francisco, New York and Philadelphia, AlphaPoint has a proven record of contributing to the development of some of largest cryptocurrency exchanges currently in use.Throughout the ICO a total of 25 mln Spark tokens will be made available, with the coins being valued at 0.0025 ETH. The coin offering begins on Valentine’s Day, Feb. 14 and will end on March 14. Because the company believes in providing equal pricing to all of its users, there will be no pre-sale. Considering the increased interest in cryptocurrencies, many of today’s exchanges can’t keep the pace up and often struggle to handle customer service and acquisition. Following the launch in mid-April, CoinSpark is fully prepared to providing top-notch customer service 24/7 in order to make sure all concerns and questions are solved quickly and efficiently.CoinSpark launches its ICO with 10 core cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Bitcoin Gold, Dash, Litecoin, Iota, Neo and Spark. Upon the successful completion and evolution of the ICO, the company’s end goal is to allow numerous other crypto coins to be featured on the exchange, as well as interact with 200+ fiat currencies. SPARK coins will be distributed immediately during the ICO, and coin holders may start trading them on the CoinSpark exchange in April.Disclaimer.

and CBOE exchanges, which launched Bitcoin futures contracts in ...","Jan 7, 2018",The New York Stock Exchange has filed for permission to launch a number of Bitcoin-related exchange-traded funds (ETF) just one week into 2018.,"As reported by BusinessInsider, a filing sent to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission shows that the exchange intends to launch five different ETFs offering ‘bull and bear’ futures contracts on the Arca stock exchange.These EFTs will be linked to the price of Bitcoin futures listed on the CME and CBOE exchanges, which launched Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017:“The target benchmark’s value will be calculated as the last sale price published by the CME or the CBOE or any other US exchange that subsequently trades bitcoin futures contracts on or before 11 a.m. E.T.”The three ‘Bull Funds’ are categorized as 1.25X, 1.5X and 2X, offering 100 percent, 150 percent and 200 percent returns on the given contract.As stated in the document sent to the SEC, the funds are not intended to be traded any longer than a day - and offer percentage returns based on the given contract entered into:“According to the Registration Statement, the 1.25X Bull Fund, 1.5X Bull Fund and 2X Bull Fund seeks daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate positively to either 125 percent, 150 percent or 200 percent the daily return of the target benchmark.”However, investors stand to a chance of facing the same multipliers in loses, should the market move against their contracts:“Conversely, its value on a given day (before fees and expenses) should lose approximately 1.25 times, 1.5 times or 2 times, as applicable, as much on a percentage basis as the level of the target benchmark when the benchmark declines.”As the name suggests, the ‘Bears Funds’ allow investors the chance to leverage against a decline in the value of Bitcoin. The two funds offered are 1X and 2X, offering 100 percent and 200 percent gains should the contract meet its target on the given day of trading.Once again, should the benchmark rise in value, Bear Fund investors stand to suffer loses compounded by the multiplier (1X or 2X) they’ve agreed to, as per the description of the 2X Bear Fund:“If the 2X Bear Fund is successful in meeting its investment objective, its value on a given day should gain approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as the level of the target benchmark when the target benchmark declines. Conversely, its value on a given day should lose approximately two times as much on a percentage basis as the level of the target benchmark when the target benchmark rises.” Should the NYSE be permitted to launch these ETFs, they will be the third American exchange to offer Bitcoin futures contracts. CME and CBOE have been trading futures since December.Wasting no time in sending their application to the SEC, this move shows that there is plenty of interest in Bitcoin by Wall Street money.While the likes of Merrill Lynch have denied its financial advisors from offering clients Bitcoin-related investments, exchanges are looking to set up of various offerings.Once a number of ETFs and trading options have been available for a while, there will be more information on how well these options are trading. Given that knowledge, could we see a change in sentiment by financial institutions whose clients are looking to enter the cryptocurrency market?"

Kryll.io, a new product, is aiming to become a game changer. The platform, starting its token sales in February, offers intuitive ways to create and execute trading strategies automatically.  ","The crypto market has remarkable growth and the pressure is high. Held by Cryptense, a full-stack Blockchain company, Kryll.io was founded by crypto-enthusiasts who experienced all the roadblocks and risks of crypto trading on their own skin. The team members say they’ve been in the picture since the early days of Blockchain. According to Kryll’s website, startup’s co-founder Philippe Longère (CTO & head of Cryptense R&D) has already developed a few bots to execute trading strategies automatically.Analyzing relevant data, preparing the right strategy and executing it around the clock within moving markets is not easy. ‘The discipline of steel and cool head needed to take the right decision at the right time,’ the company said in their white paper. “Trading is also a very technical domain where your area of expertise needs to span from an ability to perform technical analyses to machine learning and semantics analyses.”The platform is aiming to support exchanges around the globe. The architecture of Kryll encompasses several servers in Europe, Asia and North America, enabling the execution of strategies.The list of ten first exchanges supported by Kryll includes Bittrex, Coinbase, Cryptopia, HitBTC, Bitstamp and many others.Kryll is trying to make lives of crypto traders easier with a ‘What You See Is What You Trade’ (WYSIWYTTM) interface. The technology allows design trading strategies and tests them. Once the strategy proves it works, users can set their tools to live-trade on their behalf 24/7. The project’s app makes their life easier.In Blockchain era it’s all about sharing. On Kryll’s platform users can also rent-out their winning strategies to help fellow traders and, of course, receive some income for their generosity. The marketplace will also feature a chat section related to every strategy, where people would be able to receive advice from other users. Strategies on the marketplace will be rated by users.Kryll founders are also planning to organize competitions, where people will develop the best strategy in a limited time. Winners will be rewarded with Krylls, the system’s internal tokens.The Kryll’s system has five main families of blocks for building a strategy:The first one is called ‘Market Trends,’ providing trends analysis, such as price fluctuation, technical data analysis and prognosis based on machine learning.The second type of blocks, ‘Trading Actions,’ allow to buy, sell and hold your assets, or stop the trading activity if needed. The third one is ‘Signals,’ a qualified Telegram channels or social network analysis from professional traders.The ‘Operators’ blocks are organizing data feeds and signal interactions, for example, when BTC is receiving positive feedback on Twitter. Finally, ‘Notifications’ blocks keeps users informed of a strategy’s status by text messages, emails or smart notifications.Cryptense S.A.S, a Blockchain company behind the Kryll project, is based in the European technology park of Sophia Antipolis in the south of France. In December 2017, Cryptense has raised 200,000 Euros from private investors before the token sale.Trading in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum and Ripple exploded last year. Toward the end of 2017, the daily trading volume in the crypto markets equaled that of the NYSE. According to CoinMarketCap, by the end of December daily trading volume in cryptocurrency had peaked above 50 bln.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

think vastly is much more influential than tweeting to 700,000 people.","Jan 25, 2018","John McAfee has already established himself as a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency world. With his background in programming and cybersecurity, he seems to be pretty fascinated by the decentralized technology and what it has to offer to the world.","We had a talk with him during the Cruise Asia, that took place Jan. 15- 19, and found out how he researches the coins to promote, whether he has any regrets about them and why Blockchain is the best thing that happened to the humanity.Crypto Daria: You've got 700,000 followers on Twitter. Do you realize how big of an influence you have in the crypto market and do you think it's positive?John McAfee: Of course! I mean for the cryptocurrency community that's a fairly large number of followers. But it's not just that. I also speak at all the major conferences, I'm close friends with Jihan Wu of BITMAIN – the main manufacturer of, virtually, all the Bitcoin miners, Roger Ver, for instance, or Brock Pierce is my party animal that I party with. I have as much influence in that arena as I do with my followers. In fact, even more. To sit down with Roger Ver and Jihan Wu and talk about Bitcoin Cash - I think vastly is much more influential than tweeting to 700,000 people.John McAfee speaking in front of the public during the Cruise Asia, January 2018CD: How do you decide which coin to promote? How do you research them?JM: First and foremost are the principles able to actually produce what they say. Can you develop the product in a timely fashion? Do you have the team in place that understands the Blockchain, the software, the marketplace? But more importantly is something that I would like to use myself. Like Outings – hell, yes! I would love to use that program. Okay, I'll pay a dollar to get the info I can get from the app. The same with coins. I would love to have that facility - the KWHCoin. I mean I've had a lot of homes that were off the grid. There's no greater nightmare than having more electricity than you can use and this goes to waste; or not having enough. So to be able to transfer back to the electric company through tokens and someone in a place that has access to let me buy from them. Who wouldn't want that facility? So if it's something I personally want – yes, if they can do it, it's a great idea, if it's helpful to the society - there is something I would like to pass on to my children. Then, yes. I would talk about it. Because if I don’t talk about it, then who else? Nobody’s reading those white papers.CD: Do you evaluate coins differently with time?JM: Yes, of course. Everybody makes mistakes, you know. In the beginning, they said that's a great idea and then they don't pull this through.CD: Has anyone ever tried to pay you for mentioning their project and if yes, what were the projects?JM: I would say definitely they tried to pay me. I'm not going to talk about my personal finances where I make my money or from who. I set up on stage as it’s my business and it should be everybody's business. And actually, I think it's rude to even ask such questions of people. No offense.CD: Do you feel responsible for the weight of your words and subsequent pump-and-dumps that follow?JM: Absolutely not. Let's imagine: if I see something that I think the world needs to know about - I’m gonna say it. No sense in me being the only to know. I don't want to whisper it to my friends. Isn’t it far worse? The fact that people take that and pump it, and dump it - that’s their business, not mine. I mean look at on the Verge token. I said Verge would probably double in price in the next few months, well it went up fifteen thousand percent.No. Not joking. I included Verge (XVG) because it is a legitimate privacy coin and it is also selling for less than three cents. If you know investing, you know that it is easier for a 3 cent coin to go to 3 dollars, than it is for a $300 dollar coin to go to $30,000 - same rise.It wasn't my fault that people go and buy it at twenty cents. I thought two cents was a lot of money! It's not my problem, you know, I'm just recommending. Because it [company] does have some privacy things to it [coin] and it has the possibility with the race protocol to actually become a real privacy point. When it's going to happen now, I don't know. But it’s sure not worth what it is.CoinmarketcapAnd for the other people: if people want to be greedy and to look at this arena as simply a way to make money - well then they deserve what they get. They could look underneath this and say: this is a revolution! Unlike anything that the world has ever seen. Then forget the money! Why don't you look at the utility, the power of the specific token or coin and how it could change your life and the life of your friends, your loved ones and your children. I'm not gonna stop doing that. You can throw as many rotten tomatoes at me, as you want; call me any names you want - names don't hurt me. You think I'm gonna care what people call me, what they say about me? I could care less.CD: Of course. Do you have any regrets or disappointments about the coins you've mentioned?  JM: Yes, of course. I regret about FINA coin.2nd ICO this week: FINA coin. It eliminates fraud in the maritime and aviation industries - now costing in excess of $1 Billion/year. It is also is the first coin to combat terrorism and human trafficking - my hot buttons. This one is unique and stellar. https://t.co/cWU6KJzKmwI found out later that one of the founders was a member of a Nigerian criminal organization. It's hard to know all the facts until someone says “By the way, we resources and found this out.” I immediately tweeted and said that I apologize and I took back my recommendation.I have been presented with evidence that the FINA ICO was organized by an individual associated with a known Nigerian criminal organization. I have no proof that they will not follow through and list the coins or develop a product, but I must withdraw my support. Details coming.But this is the nature of the business. I mean if we're in a brand new economy, brand new paradigm if I don't step in mud bubbles than I'm not doing my job.CD: What's your number one piece of advice for the crypto investors?JM: There is none. Because whatever I recommend today will change tomorrow. There'll be something that comes and replaces it. I believe that the future of cryptocurrency is in the new emerging coins technologies and creative ideas that are coming out to through the ICOs. And everybody's overlooking this. People seem to be only concerned with making money - “Is Bitcoin going to rise or fall?” “Is Ethereum going to rise or fall?” “Is there going to be another fork in Bitcoin?”,”What's that gonna be?” “Is it Bitcoin or a Bitcoin Cash?” Screw that, this has nothing to do with these things. It has to do with what's coming behind us, what's emerging from the ground and what is going to change our future. We're forgetting that these are real, life-changing, culture-changing events, attitudes, products, creations. And we have got to watch them. If not - we're gonna miss out on something and the good stuff is gonna get swamped and drowned in the garbage. That is the overall sea of ICOs. We already know, what Bitcoin is, we know what Ethereum is. Fine, do what you want with it. Start digging into the new technologies in there. There’s going to be a Henry Ford, there's gonna be the concept equivalent to the railroad, there's going to be something that will change our lives in such a beautiful way, that if we miss it, we will regret it for a lifetime.CD: Are you worried about the recent Bitcoin price dip, given your promise in case it falls?JM: Not at all. When Jamie Dimon announced that Bitcoin was a fraud, Bitcoin dropped 40 percent in a matter of hours. I didn't worry then, I'm not worried now. It has its own life.When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017. BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bircoin at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my dick if wrong. pic.twitter.com/WVx3E71nyDCD: What made you make that promise in the first place?​JM: I was on television and it just came out. They said “Will the Bitcoin fall?” And I said: “I'm gonna eat my eat my genitals if it’s not five hundred thousand dollars. And this is back when Bitcoin was four thousand dollars. It's since gone way beyond what I thought it would go. I thought i was wrong, so my projections are way wrong, I changed it to a million dollars. You will see, it will happen.CD: In your opinion, what prompted the recent market fall and what to expect next?JM: The same thing that prompted the original crash of Bitcoin, which was JP Morgan, one of the world's largest banks and certainly America's largest bank. All banks all terrified. Everybody's wallet is a bank now and we won’t need banks anymore. Banks are going to disappear, if they do not do something.CD: Your Twitter account seems to be a constant victim of hacks. How does it happen?JM: It's only been hacked once. I know exactly how it happened, because the people who did it contacted me. They used a new technique called SIM Swapping. At first I thought they didn’t hack my account - I can't be active. I thought they hacked Twitter, but what they did, they hacked my carrier AT&T, which is the largest carrier.  So what they did, using social engineering, kept calling local offices until they found the sympathetic hero. ""Oh, my name is John McAfee, I lost my SIM cards, I have a new one. Can you please change my account to this?"" And eventually someone did. My phone stopped working. Then they went into Twitter and say I forgot my password, please, send it to my phone.Urgent: My account was hacked. Twitter has been notified. The coin of the day tweet was not me. As you all know... I am not doing a coin of the day anymore!!!!And so they sent a code to what is supposed to be to my phone but it's their phone. They use that code, change my password and they were on for two and a half hours while I struggled to get back in. I finally hacked myself back in and through the mail. I've never heard of that technique before. It's a brand new social engineering technique of hackling. So it was not Twitter, it was AT&T. I complained to AT&T; they did nothing. What I did is that I took off two-factor authentication, if I had not had  two-factor authentication, they could not have hacked me. So now, what used to be the best way to protect yourself, turned out to be the worst, because if you have your phone number in there, then they can get it; they can go in and send that. If you don't have a phone number, they can't send the code anywhere, and they've got to figure out my password, which is impossible.CD: How do you perceive the core philosophy behind cryptocurrency?JM: Well the core philosophy is one of the greatest in the world - “let's take power away from the centralized agencies!” When power coalesces, when it compresses into a large entity, it always becomes corrupt. And power always corrupts whether you're an individual or a corporation. So it [the Blockchain technology] takes that away and distributes that power to us. So what this means is that the entire structure of civilization is going to unwind and will reassemble itself in a way that it should have been from the very beginning. We, as people, having our own freedom, our own power. Not having to ask you permission or the government's permission before I can do something. Like send somebody money or receive money, or buy something as long as I'm not harming you or my neighborhood. Then why the hell should I ask permission from anyone to do anything? So this is what's happening, we're entering a permissionless world, where when you reach adulthood, wherever that is, in whatever country and it's different, in Central America, it's the age of 12 (*note: in the countries of Central America the legal age varies from 14 to 18), in America it's 21, when you become an adult, you become your own master. You don't need to ask anybody's permission to do anything. This is the change and this is what's going to take this world and give us finally the opportunity to create Eden, to create perfection. Now we will screw it, we always do, but even in screwing it up - it would be far better than what exists today.CD: And how do you see the future of the crypto industry?JM: It's going to explode. I mean we're just in the infancy right now. As I mentioned every aspect of life is getting its own coin and it should have its own coin. It needs its own coin. Because every coin has a different function or should have. So it's going to be like the Internet when it first began. Only a hundred times more profound, more deep and will have an impact that I cannot possibly ignore you foresee even five years out.CD: Thank you for taking the time!*Note from the Cointelegraph editorial team"

Bank Indonesia cites concerns over potential use in money laundering and funding terrorism as reasons behind their anti-cryptocurrency campaign:“Virtual currencies are vulnerable to bubble risks and susceptible to be used for money laundering and terrorism financing, therefore can potentially impact financial system stability and cause financial harm to society.”While there is no official ban on Bitcoin within the country, per Wikipedia, the press release forbidding all activity relating to cryptocurrency takes a harsher tone than previous statements that merely advised citizens to be careful around Bitcoin.Algeria’s government has also taken steps towards a crypto ban, with reports that the 2018 Finance Bill will make Bitcoin ownership and trading illegal within the country.

He intends to work with the G20 nations to offer US tracking abilities in order to prevent such misuse from occurring. He said:“If you have a wallet to own Bitcoins, that company has the same obligation as a bank to know [you]. We can track those activities. The rest of the world doesn’t have that, so one of the things we will be working very closely with the G-20 is making sure that this doesn’t become the Swiss bank account.”Mnuchin doesn’t seem to understand that not all wallets are hosted by “companies.”Cryptocurrency industry experts, however, aren’t so thrilled about the idea of more regulations. For example, Sergei Sevriugin, CEO and Founder of risk-sharing platform REGA, told Cointelegraph:“I think the regulation already exists for cryptocurrency but, regulation by the community not central authorities, which is the best type of regulation that can ever exist. Centralized regulation will kill the idea of crypto currencies; and, without any control from the community, this type of regulation will lead to several problems, including corruption. We can all remember the last crisis, including the mortgage system collapse in 2008, was under full control and regulation.

He expressed a belief that there’s little risk of such activities, saying that he is ‘not at all’ worried that countries such as Russia and Venezuela would be able to function in that way."

Eastern neighbors Korea and China have enforced heavy regulations that have tried to stifle a movement that is conversely gaining massive traction in the land of the rising sun.One needs to look no further than Internet sensation Miss Bitcoin to see that the Japanese are a people that are embracing change, in the form of virtual currency.Following in her wake is a new Japanese Pop (J-Pop) group that hope to educate people about cryptocurrency.Virtual Currency Girls is comprised of eight band members known as ‘Kaso Tsuka Shojo.’ Each singer takes up the identity of a number of different virtual currencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum.J-Pop has been massive since its inception in the 1990s - and it seems the music group could pioneer a new way of spreading information about cryptocurrency and the potential benefits they could have for society.According to the group’s leader, 19-year-old Rara Naruse, the pop group hopes to shed some light on the intended use of cryptocurrencies as quoted by Japan Today:“This unit is not here to promote speculation or investment. Out of the numerous existing virtual currencies, we have carefully selected a handful of currencies that are sure to exist in the future in order to broaden the public’s understanding of them using entertainment as our medium.”According to AFP, the group will hold its first concert on Friday, Jan. 12 in Tokyo."

He continued:“We have had meetings with the Supreme Court so that people who have been victims of seizures and arrests in previous years will have charges dismissed.”In the same address, Vargas confirmed that the highly controversial Petro cryptocurrency, initiated by President Nicolas Maduro, would go ahead with a presale February 20.Petro had faced an uncertain future almost as soon as Maduro announced the scheme, with commentators suggesting investors would be hard to find given the raft of sanctions against Venezuela, which the President hoped the coin could help circumvent.Venezuela’s opposition-run parliament, which has worked against the President at every chance it’s had since 2016, called the coin a 'fraud' earlier this month.Petro is designed to be backed by Venezuela’s oil reserves, with one token equalling one barrel.

So we wish you always find time in the new 2018 year to get creative energy out of printed, written, digital versions of novels, essays, interviews, etc. Enjoy the reading! “There is one thing, in the space, in the Blockchain space, that I recommend everyone to read. It's super easy to understand. It's written in very simple words. Each word has meaning. It's a Bitcoin paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It's eight pages and everyone should read it!  At least the first pages. It's super easy! People think that it's not easy. People think they start the grid net and they're gonna be ""Oh my god, I don’t understand anything"" but it's amazingly easy to read. And that's what you need to do when you're in this space. And it’s very inspiring as well.”- Salome Parulava, Moeco “First of all, I didn’t read quite a long time. I didn't really have time to read books because of all of these Blockchain developments. But recently, I realized that there's a really out of roots kind of expectation of people for cryptocurrency. But for you as an investor - to make a right decision on cryptocurrency - you need to understand the fundamental of Blockchain first. So, please, go ahead and read “Blockchain for dummies.” That's got to be a good starting book for people to really understand what is the under layer, technology, what is Bitcoin made of. Then, maybe, you have a better judgment -  don't just listen to anyone that Bitcoin is good or anything ever is good. You just learn about the technology first!”- Cris Tran, QRC Group “It’s actually an old-school book that’s come up. It always comes up irrelevant. I’ve just finished re-reading it on a flight. It’s not a Blockchain book, it’s actually much older than that – it’s called “The Mythical Man-Month” – it’s an explanation and an exploration of what it takes to successfully build software. I think the author really understands the best software. We like to talk about it, I think, we like to teach it in many ways as a hard science, but the best software is really art. The code is just a medium, so rather than painting you use code to express yourself artistically through software. I think that he has a very good grasp of that nuance, but also it’s a very clear-headed approach to the fact that you’re managing, you’re working with a large number of developers, everyone with their own understanding. It can be very hard to deliver things on time, schedule… and he talks about his lessons – he was one of the very first operating system designers. He had done software called OS/360 which predates us by 13 years. He had managed huge teams and, actually, he talks very frankly about his failures and lessons he learned. He knew the right way to approach building projects, so if you haven’t read that one, I highly recommend it.”- Joshua Lavin, EOS In this book from 1976, Friedrich Hayek advocated the establishment of competitively issued private money.According to Hayek, instead of a national government issuing a specific currency, use of which is imposed on all members of its economy by force in the form of legal tender laws, private businesses should be allowed to issue their own forms of money, deciding how to do so on their own.Recommended by Wang Binsheng, investor, advisor at Blockchain Development Organization “It's a recent book by super-smart guy. His name is Dave Birch. I love the author: his talks and his books, he helped me. He has written several books and they're all amazing. The previous book was called ""Identity the New Money"" - full of insights, very inspirational, so I recommend it!”- Salome Parulava, Moeco “A book called Stealing Fire is the one I would recommend right now. <...> Hopefully, we’re not spending too much time dwelling on the past. We can learn from the past, but the past is history. There’s no changing that and it’s the future that’s a mystery and where the fun stuff lies.”- Brock PierceNick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his research in digital contracts and digital currency. He is a very prolific creator: among other things, for example, in 1998, he designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency called ""Bit Gold,"" never implemented, but precursing the Bitcoin architecture. He has also developed the phrase and concept of ""smart contracts.""In his blog he approaches, in his own words, “an unending variety of topics” - economics, law, history and security. What happens when a journalist digs into crypto using his best reporting and story-telling skills? Answer: an unusual story of Bitcoin and the rise of its technology through the eyes of the movement’s colorful central characters, including an Argentinian millionaire, a Chinese entrepreneur, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and its elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.Digital Gold by The New York Times technology reporter Nathaniel Popper is one of the best introductions to Bitcoin for the wide audience. The author provides deep view into industry from outside. For those who are already in it and don’t wish to refresh history created by Satoshi Nakamoto, Gavin Andresen, Erik Vorhees, Roger Ver, and the Winklevoss Twins, this book could be given to your mom - to spare quite a lot of time of explaining what we are actually doing here.“Actually, the one that the most impacted me was the guy named Andreas. He is actually Greek. You can search on YouTube. He is passionate about Bitcoin and Blockchain technology. And what it can bring to change the world and eliminate the trust between people and the government. Basically, corrupt this whole system by stealing your wealth, you know? What he basically suggests is stealing your wealth in a stealth mode. So you have a one thousand today, you have one thousand tomorrow - actually your wealth is still the same. But, for one thousand today you cannot buy the one thousand tomorrow's goods because of the inflation. Because they are printing money, they are stealing wealth in a stealth mode. You cannot see it, cannot complain because you have one thousand now, you have one thousand tomorrow – doesn't change. Basically, people don't see it but this guy, he saw the problem and explained quite well. That is what made me inspired. We should go and explore more about Blockchain and bring the services and products to the market.”- Woanjen Tang, OrioncoinThe only person to be awarded both the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences and the Abel Prize, John Nash inspired a Hollywoodian movie A Beautiful Mind, that is also worth watching.The theory developed by the mathematician J. Nash became fundamental for economics, politics and management. Nash equilibrium, presented in his Princeton University dissertation basically talks about interaction of two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the others, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy. Nash's work has provided insights into the factors that govern chance and decision-making inside complex systems found in everyday life. “To be honest, this is maybe not so specific to Blockchain and cryptocurrency, but one of my favorite personal books… Well, actually, I have two. The first one is “Dealing with China” by Henry Paulson. He was a former Goldman Sachs CEO and then-Treasury Secretary under George W. Bush. He talked about his experiences and how he did business with China – and this is really inspired a lot of things I’m doing. The second one would be “One Hour in China” book by Jeffrey Towson and Jonathan Woetzel. Jeffrey Towson is a professor at Peking University and Jonathan Woetzel is a partner at McKinsey in Shanghai. They wrote a book that condenses everything you need to know about China into one hour. It started inspiring me to write a lot about Chinese consumers. I do a lot of writings. I write for LinkedIn China, I write for Cointelegraph. Those two books formed me in what I’m trying to do.”- John Patrick Mullin “I would not hesitate recommending Homo Deus by Harari which is a very well written, very crisp vision of the future and our challenges as we redefine what it means to be human in the XXI century.”- David Orban, advisor to the Singularity University “Interestingly enough, I’ve been going back to Plato lately. Plato’s “Republic” is an ancient dialog about if we were going to make a new country, what things would we include and what things would we not include. Talking about developing new communities, I think there are a lot of applications for philosophy in Blockchain and AI. Because we’re building the future of our world, what are we going to keep and what are we not going to keep? Recently I saw an interview with Vitalik, the famous guy in the Ethereum. One of the things he loves about his job, as he said is, “I get to apply philosophy and technology every day.” There would be my recommendation. Go back to the classics.”- Daniel Finn, Smartmesh“So there's not a lot of books that I get inspired. But I do like interviews and articles from well-established, respected people. How they look at cryptocurrency and Bitcoin. So, for example, Marc Andreessen, who's the founder of Andreessen Horowitz, which is one of the number one or top in the world, did a New York Times article. I think it was around 2013. “Why Bitcoin Matters?” To the state, I think it's one of the best articles. I think everybody should google it. It’s still relevant! Four years later! And a few others like there's Larry Summers who used to be in the Ministry of Finance and made a wonderful speech about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency and he's so knowledgeable and that's a video people should try to find. And most recently the CEO of Goldman Sachs Lloyd Blankfein. He talked about that he's not skeptic or skeptical of anything new. But he believes that there's a big opportunity in Bitcoin. So when you look at that, you know that mainstream finance will come into this space. Especially like Goldman Sachs. So it was a CNN interview of Lloyd from Goldman Sachs. And those are things and it's all small snippets. I think people should watch that.”- Mike Kayamori, QUOINE One of the funniest and intelligent views on futurism - the Hitchhiker’s Guide became classics for those who want to see beyond the present.

CFTC data show near-zero trading in Cboe's Bitcoin futures by banks ...","Jan 18, 2018","Unlike the stock market, which is seeing its eight-year bull run thanks, in part, to institutional investors, crypto-markets are dominated by individual investors. This is evident by almost every metric.","Crypto-exchanges, which are havens for individual investors, are overwhelmed. Popular crypto-exchange, Binance recently revealed that they added 250,000 new users in a single day. Kraken is onboarding 50,000 new accounts daily and they are logging an astonishing 10,000 new support tickets every day. In a blog post, Kraken developers wrote:“The recent unexpected explosion in demand has been overwhelming.”Some exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex and CEX.io have temporarily halted new account registrations so that they can update their technology and better prepare their platforms for the rush of individual investors flooding the market.Moreover, the much-anticipated Bitcoin futures contracts are also being dominated by individual investors. According to The Wall Street Journal:“In a sign of how more conservative firms are keeping their distance, the CFTC data show near-zero trading in Cboe’s Bitcoin futures by banks and asset managers.”There is endless speculation about a crypto-bubble. Whenever prices begin to shift, or the famously volatile crypto-market fluctuates, pundits are quick to declare the bubble burst and the movement over. When cryptocurrencies endured a flash crash before Christmas, commentators flooded the internet with their crypto post-mortems. Of course, most prices recovered within a single day.In reality, the crypto-party isn’t winding down. It’s just getting started.Institutional money is on its way, and when that happens, digital currency values will receive a significant boost. Even JP Morgan Chase CEO and infamous crypto-skeptic, Jamie Dimon, recently expressed regret for describing Bitcoin as a fraud. In an interview with Fox Business, Dimon acknowledged that “the Blockchain is real.” He went on to express support for cryptocurrencies that represent traditional currencies like dollars and yen.Dimon’s comments were made as CNBC reported that altcoin Ripple has more than 100 clients from the mainstream banking industry using its XRP token. On January 11th, MoneyGram signed on to test Ripple’s XRP token as a digital method for sending money. Ripple’s price rose 25% after the news before receding later that day.As Blockchain use-cases become more prevalent, expect increased institutional investment in cryptocurrency markets.In October, The Wall Street Journal reported that investment juggernaut Goldman Sachs is considering offering a Bitcoin-related investment product. In comments to the Journal, a Goldman spokesman said:“In response to client interest in digital currencies, we are exploring how best to serve them in this space.”Ultimately, individual interest spurs institutional interest, and that will have a significant impact on the value of digital currencies.Bitcoin futures contracts on Chicago based exchanges run by CME Group and Cboe Group represent burgeoning opportunities for institutional investment. Specifically, they indicate that much anticipated crypto-ETF funds may soon be available for investors. Moreover, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley, in 2017 hedge funds invested more than $2 billion in crypto-related assets. This is a lot of money, but it’s a small percentage of the possible investment.In short, Bitcoin hedge funds are counting their profits in thousands of percent and institutional investors can’t stay away forever.As digital currencies continue to gain exposure, they are proving remarkably resilient to investors’ worst fears. Technology is rapidly improving, and many of the same features and safeguards currently maintaining traditional investment markets are increasingly present in crypto-markets as well.Although the total crypto market cap is tremendous, it’s far from its full potential. Cryptocurrencies are just now becoming household names, and they are still shedding some of our preconceptions that stigmatized investment. However, the real growth driver will be institutional investments, which will be spurred on by the individual investors who want to participate in crypto markets through institutional platforms and by the market forces that make the possibility of considerable profits too essential to pass up.Alexander Kravets, co-founder of xtrade.ioDisclaimer.

However, that has not stopped the massive influx of users looking to trade cryptocurrency.Having giving clarity in the direction it wants to take in December, cryptocurrency traders and miners in Russia know what to expect - with a ban ruled out completely.It wouldn’t be surprising to see more big mining operations pop up in the country as demand for cryptocurrency grows - which inevitably puts more strain on the network."

RaiBlocks was also one of the only two coins in the red on Jan. 12 when the rest of the market was up.RaiBlocks’s fall could be attributed to recent reports of a compromised web wallet for the altcoin, which has since been taken offline.Ethereum Classic (ETC) has seen the most growth over 24 hours, up more than 17 percent and selling for $44.32 at press time. This growth was likely caused by a Jan. 12 CNBC interview with Michael Sonnenshein, director at Bitcoin (BTC) and ETC investment fund Grayscale, speaking about the future of digital currency investment in terms of ETC.Altcoin Neo also saw a small rise, growing almost three percent over 24 hours and selling for $137.45 at press time, with Bitcoin Gold also slightly up with 0.37 percent growth over 24 hours and selling for $297.98 at press time.Bitcoin is down about seven percent over 24 hours and is trading at press time for an average of $13,474.70, higher than the Dec. 22 market low price of $12,850."

Some exchanges have overhauled their systems to improve their scalability, while others have temporarily stopped opening new user accounts.This week, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, the global market’s largest cryptocurrency exchange with a staggering $9.5 bln daily trading volume, revealed that it has added more than 250,000 users on a single day.“Sorry guys, servicing existing members is higher priority at this point. Full team working around the clock. Both tech and support. Just too much demand. Added 250,000 new users in the last 24 hours,” said Zhao, referencing the official statement released by the company.On Jan. 4, Binance stated, “due to the overwhelming surge in popularity, Binance will have to temporarily disable new user registrations to allow for an infrastructure upgrade. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.”In December, both Kraken and Coinbase allocated a significant portion of their resources and capital in improving customer support and the scalability of their platforms. On Dec. 23, Kraken, which has found difficulty in processing account verifications, disclosed that it has implemented major system upgrades and improvements in performance and will continue to develop its trading platform to support new users.The Kraken development team admitted that its current infrastructure is “degraded and unreliable,” and vowed to improve it throughout January. The company said:“We have made significant progress in the last week with the system upgrades and have realized moderate improvement in performance. Unfortunately, we were not able to complete all of the upgrades and the most impactful measures are yet to come. For the time being, systems should still be considered degraded and unreliable.”Regional exchanges such as South Korea’s Bithumb, the world’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of daily trading volume, have also stopped accepting new users.In late 2017, South Korea’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange Korbit was acquired at a valuation of $140 mln by a $10 bln gaming giant in Nexon. Given the size and the market valuation of Korbit, major exchanges like Bithumb, Bitstamp, Kraken and Binance could be worth more than $1 bln, as Coinbase was valued at $1.6 bln in its latest funding round.Even with such large market valuation, high-profit margins, and many resources, cryptocurrency exchanges are struggling to address the exponentially increasing demand from investors because of the strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems the companies were forced to implement by the authorities.Each user application must be manually approved and verified. The failure to segregate fraudulent accounts from legitimate users could result in large fines and lawsuits for exchanges. Consequently, the vetting process of users is rigorous and requires significant efforts from the employees of exchanges.Given that exchanges are adding more than 100,000 users per day, it is likely that exchanges are also receiving more than one mln trading account approval requests per month, at least.That is, if the approval process of accounts take around 10 minutes per account, 166,666 hours on a monthly basis that employees have to cover manually.In the next few months, global cryptocurrency exchanges will make drastic changes to their systems. Until then, users, especially newcomers, will find it difficult to open approved trading accounts."

The move made the coin’s price appear to drop 30 percent and put it in third place on the market. Perhaps due in part to panic selling after Ripple’s sudden apparent drop, the altcoin has continued to fall, trading at an average of $1.95 at press time.On the 8th spot, Stellar Lumen's price has dropped almost 13 percent to $0.54. In the same vein, Cardano is at the receiving end of the ongoing market depression, also falling almost 13 percent and bringing price from over $1 to the $0.75 zone.New Economic movement (NEM) wasn't spared either, succumbing to an 11 percent decay and trading at $1.45 at press time.Dash has made it back into the top 10 coins, pushing the TRON, the altcoin that broke into the top ten last week, back to 12th place.  In suit was the Silver of Cryptocurrency, Litecoin, which lost a relatively low 2.2 percent over the past 24 hours, currently selling at $242.IOTA is now at the 9th position and posted a negative 5.84 percent along with a price of $3.45.

He says:""Most cryptocurrencies we see launching today are likely to fail, but there’s still a lot of money to be made if you can identify the long-term winners successfully and early.”Mike Novogratz, a well-known investor who has been bullish on Bitcoin for some time now, has made statements indicating agreement. He has called the asset a bubble, but one where there is money to be made. Novogratz said:“This is going to be the largest bubble of our lifetimes. Prices are going to get way ahead of where they should be. You can make a whole lot of money on the way up, and we plan on it.”As the cryptocurrency space has evolved, prices have risen astronomically with the influx of interest from the mainstream market. Those who have joined the space in recent times have seen the likes of Bitcoin build to as high as $20,000.However, those who have joined this space in their droves have clearly done for the profiteering that has taken place, and the promise of more to come. This then means that there is more of a diluted core of users who are in it to see the technology thrive and flourish.In turn, this not only adds to the speculative nature of the market but also to the bubble-nature that Novogratz refers to. The entire crypto space may not be as prone to a big collapse, or a catastrophic failure like some flimsy ICOs, but there are still concerns for those looking for pure profit.The real issue in the market being flooded with people in it to make a quick buck is that the potentially revolutionary technology can be pushed towards bubble technology. It is not the product that is prone to being in a bubble. It is the way in which it is used or perceived that leads to bubbles being formed and popped.The dot-com bubble has shown a lot of similarities to Bitcoin’s rapid growth, but that does not mean dot-com businesses or digital businesses, are always going to be bubbles. And the same applies to Bitcoin.In the dot-com boom, people were entering the market to make money, and they were throwing money at anything with .com on the end. It is happening today too, with Bitcoin and Blockchain, but that does not mean a bubble is a definite.If people continue to flood the cryptocurrency market intent on only making money off it, rather than appreciating it as a new wave of technology, then Gouws’ opinion may be spot on. People will enter have a direct say in which way something like this moves, with their speculative investing.There needs to be a concerted push to appreciate the technology, and adopt it for mainstream uses if Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, are to be a long term success."

Following the announcement of Bitcoin futures launch early that month on CME, Coinbase saw 100,000 new users sign up in just 24 hours.Although Bitcoin’s long bull run ended in the week leading up to Christmas, its rise to an all time high of $20,000 in mid-December saw Coinbase make massive revenues through trades on its platform.The cryptocurrency exchange makes revenue by charging fees for fiat to crypto conversions via its Buy/Sell feature and for trades on its GDAX exchange.The success of Coinbase has not gone unnoticed by investors and venture capitalists. According to Recode’s report, shares in the company are being sought out on a number of fronts.However, Coinbase shareholders have been told not to sell their shares to outside parties. Doing so would constitute a breach of policy, Coinbase told Recode in a statement:""As a private company, Coinbase does not allow trading of stock on secondary markets for a variety of reasons, including the fact that there is not full and equal information available to the market.

The number is at over $825 bln as of press time and keeps growing.","Following a two-day period of sharp decline just before the New Year, the majority of cryptocurrencies are now growing again, contributing to the rapid increase in the combined market capitalization.The latest all-time high comes just under a month after the market has achieved a total capitalization of $500 bln. This immense growth, coupled with the fact that 2017 started at a mere $18 bln combined, seems to indicate that cryptocurrency is well on its way to becoming a trillion-dollar industry.Speaking of individual coins that are driving this upward dynamic, several are of note. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, is hovering at a relatively stable price range between $16,500 and $17,000, with slight growth over the past week. However, the share of its capitalization against that of the market as a whole is still at all-time lows of around 34 percent, as major competitors seem to be outpacing it.Ethereum, for example, has surpassed the $1,000 mark for the first time this Friday and keeps growing. Among the likely reasons for this dynamic is the immense level of adoption of the cryptocurrency, which seems to be higher than that of the rest of the market combined.Ripple is another major producer of growth on the market. It started skyrocketing in mid-December 2017 and has already managed to displace Ethereum as the second-highest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, making its own chairman potentially the richest person on the planet in the process.However, even if you disregard the major players, there are a lot of factors as to why the numbers are growing so fast. When even meme coins are reaching billion-dollar capitalizations, countries are issuing their own cryptocurrencies, and prominent tech CEOs like Thiel and Zuckerberg are eyeing the industry, a trillion-dollar combined market cap can easily seem a distinct possibility."

The malware employed shared code with Destover malware, which was used against Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 and the first WannaCry victim in February 2017,” the report read.In February 2017, Bithumb, the second largest cryptocurrency exchange in the global market by daily trading volume, fell victim to a security breach that led to the loss of around $7 mln of user funds, mostly in Bitcoin and Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency Ether.The report released by Recorded Future noted that the $7 mln Bithumb security breach has been linked to North Korean hackers. Insikt Group researchers, a group of cybersecurity researchers that closely track the activities of North Korean hackers regularly, revealed that Lazarus Group, in particular, has used a wide range of tools from spear phishing attacks to malware distribution through communication platforms to gain access to cryptocurrency wallets and accounts.Insikt Group researchers disclosed that Lazarus Group hackers initiated a massive malware campaign in the fall of 2017 and since then, North Korean hackers have focused on spreading malware by attaching files containing fraudulent software to gain access to individual devices.One method Lazarus Group employed was the distribution of Hangul Word Processor (HWP) files through email, the South Korea equivalent of Microsoft Word documents, with malware attached. If any cryptocurrency user downloads the malware, it autonomously installs itself and operates in the background, taking control of or manipulating data stored within the specific device.“By 2017, North Korean actors had jumped on the cryptocurrency bandwagon. The first known North Korean cryptocurrency operation occurred in February 2017, with the theft of $7 mln (at the time) in cryptocurrency from South Korean exchange Bithumb. By the end of 2017, several researchers had reported additional spear phishing campaigns against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, numerous successful thefts, and even Bitcoin and Monero mining,” Insikt Group researchers wrote.Prior to the release of Recorded Future’s report, several other cybersecurity firms had accused North Korean hacking groups of targeting South Korean cryptocurrency trading platforms with sophisticated malware and phishing attack tools.Researchers at FireEye linked six targeted cyber attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges to state-financed hackers based in North Korea. Most recently, as Cointelegraph reported, police investigators and the Korea Internet and Security Agency initiated a full investigation into a security breach that led to the bankruptcy of YouBit, a South Korean cryptocurrency trading platform.At the time, local investigators stated that they have found evidence to link the YouBit security breach to North Korean hackers. FireEye senior analyst Luke McNamara also told Bloomberg that similar tools widely utilized by North Korean hackers were employed in the YouBit hacking attack.“This an adversary that we have been watching become increasingly capable and also brazen in terms of the targets that they are willing to go after. This is really just one prong in a larger strategy that they seem to be employing since at least 2016, where they have been using capability that has been primarily used for espionage to actually steal funds.”"

Kraken engineers had estimated the downtime would only be two hours. Much like Gilligan’s three-hour cruise that went horribly wrong, Kraken users all over the Internet are raging over the downtime and asking difficult questions.","Nearly all digital currency exchanges have faced significant growing pains in the last year, as the interest in cryptocurrencies has grown exponentially. Coinbase and Bitstamp have been overwhelmed with user traffic, leading to delays. Bitfinex has been hit by DDOS attacks and recently had to stop registration for new users because of overwhelming demand. Binance and Bittrex have also halted new user signups.Still, Kraken has arguably suffered the most problems of all major exchanges. Users, including myself, have experienced multiple connection errors and extraordinary difficulties placing and cancelling orders. It’s sometimes necessary to refresh Kraken’s page 10-15 times before being able to execute an action. Numerous users have complained that Kraken posted their orders multiple times (after telling them their order failed initially), in some cases costing them thousands of dollars.While many have encouraged users of Kraken to go elsewhere, it’s not always that easy. US users are particularly limited in the exchanges they can use, particularly with Bitfinex ditching them earlier last year. For certain altcoins, US traders may only be able to use Kraken to trade them against fiat. Likewise, Kraken is one of the only markets where US residents can long or short Bitcoin.Such users were delighted when, on December 15, Kraken announced a major upgrade to fix the site’s usability problems:“Kraken.com performance is extremely degraded and unreliable.  Clients can expect severe latency and difficulty interacting with all web and API services.  Requests will frequently timeout and fail.  At the moment, the only solution is to wait and try again later.Next week we will be rolling out a major systems upgrade which should resolve these scaling and load issues.  The upgrade is long overdue and has been substantially delayed by the diversion of resources toward the protracted fire fighting effort required to deal with the last several months of unrelenting growth.”The upgrade scheduled for the third week of December was rescheduled twice, before finally commencing January 10 at 9 PM PST. The status page Kraken set up for the upgrade stated:“We are performing a system upgrade on Thursday, January 11 at approximately 5:00 UTC (Wednesday January 10 at 9 pm PT). Kraken services will be offline for about 2 hours during the upgrade, possibly longer.”Over the next two days, Kraken has continued to update the status page, complaining of late starts and the upgrade progressing more slowly than expected. Finally, they announced that the upgrade was in its final stages, before then posting that “a number of issues” came up in their “final testing.” Kraken is not clear on why this “final testing” was apparently done on production servers.About one day after the two hour upgrade began, Kraken posted:“We are making progress on the few remaining issues but don't have a definite launch time yet. We intend to cancel stale (and possibly all) orders and pause liquidations upon resuming service. More details to follow soon. Thank you for your patience.”It’s unclear exactly how this will work. The price of Bitcoin and altcoins has of course changed over the last two days, and nobody is quite sure how Kraken will keep people from losing money on long and short positions that might have been closed had the exchange been working properly.Most astonishing of all, about 36 hours after the upgrade began, Kraken apparently sent their engineers home to take a nap! Kraken writes:“We are close but rather than launch immediately ahead of the team passing out, we will push off a bit to get some rest and be able to better monitor systems and react to problems following launch. Unfortunately, this means several more hours of delay.”At press time, Kraken is still down with no ETA for resumption of trading, and the exchange has not responded to our requests for comment.Update Jan. 13: the system upgrade on Kraken has been finished and the exchange has come back online."

No other cryptocurrencies, including Ripple (XRP), were stolen, contrary to the early reports covered by Cointelegraph.According to the exchange’s representatives, the hackers have managed to steal the private key for the hot wallet where NEM coins were stored, enabling them to drain the funds.All the stolen money belonged to the customers of the exchange. The ‘inappropriate’ movement of the funds was reported by Coincheck to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, as well as the police later on the same day.Shortly after the breach, the company halted all withdrawals from the site, hoping to stop any further damage to its funds. When asked whether they will begin allowing “at least” fiat currency withdrawals soon, Coincheck replied that that will be done after they have determined the best way to proceed.It has come to light that the funds were being stored on a simple hot wallet rather than a much more secure multisig wallet.Coincheck’s representatives have claimed that the security setup differs between various coins on the exchange.Other cryptocurrencies on the site are currently stored in multisig wallets, but the NEM was not. When pressed by the media, the company insisted that “security standards were not low,” however the lack of multisig protection for NEM may indicate the opposite.The company made clear that they use various wallet types for housing different assets. Specifically, Bitcoin and Ether are stored in cold storage wallets, with Bitcoin additionally having a multisig address. Ether, “given its nature,” is not stored on a multisig wallet.According to their statement, more than half of Coincheck’s 80 permanent employees work on systems development, including security.Going forward, Coincheck claimed that it knows the address where the stolen NEM is currently being stored by the hackers, and is hoping to be able to track the culprits.While the company cannot currently disclose how many users were affected, they have expressed a desire to refund all the money that was lost.When asked whether they are going to resume operations or will have to declare bankruptcy, Coincheck said that ‘in principle’ they plan to keep operating.While the exchange has expressed a desire to refund all lost funds, they nevertheless are still considering how to approach the situation. Per the press conference, the “worst-case scenario” would be that the funds can never be returned.When asked whether they have any words for the customers, Coincheck representatives have said that they “deeply regret” what happened."

It is important to acknowledge that the use of cash or any currency in financial crimes is banned.The mainstream media, especially outlets in India, interpreted the statement as a ban on cryptocurrencies and released premature reports claiming the government has banned the market. This week, on national television, India’s Finance Minister strongly refused cryptocurrency ban rumors.Sunny Ray, the founder and president of Unocoin, told Cointelegraph:“We are happy that the Finance Minister has recognized the importance and popularity of cryptocurrency, and has chosen to talk about it on budget day. As far as the exact content of what he said, we are largely neutral about it. However, we are pained to see his words being misinterpreted and misreported, by a section of the media.”Ray emphasized that the statement of India’s Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was misinterpreted by the media which reported it as a ban on cryptocurrencies when Jaitley simply noted that the use of cryptocurrencies in illegal activities will be prohibited and restricted. Also, Jaitley stated that Bitcoin is not a legal tender. But Bitcoin is not a legal tender in anywhere in the world. Legal tender implies that it is illegal not to accept a certain asset. It is certainly not illegal to not accept Bitcoin in Japan, the US, South Korea, and everywhere else globally.Ray added:“During question hour in Rajya Sabha on Jan. 2, 2018, the Finance Minister had made the exact same point, where he stated that, ‘Bitcoins or such cryptocurrencies are not legal tender.’ This has been the position taken by almost all governments around the world, and we regard this statement quite neutrally. It is our understanding that only currency notes and coins are legal tender. To extrapolate that to mean that such assets are ‘illegal’ is silly at best, and grossly irresponsible at worst.”Sandeep Goenka, the co-founder of ZebPay, another major cryptocurrency exchange in India with millions of users on its mobile app alone, shared a similar sentiment as Unocoin’s Sunny Ray. Goenka stated that the India Blockchain Committee remains optimistic in regards to the statement released by India’s Finance Minister and that the media grossly misinterpreted his words.Goenka further explained that local exchanges welcome the Indian government's intention to eliminate the use of cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. Last year, Indian cryptocurrency exchanges assisted local enforcement in investigating into a bank theft that led to the loss of millions of dollars. As local exchanges have done in the past, they intend to continuously support the government in its crackdown on illicit activities surrounding cryptocurrencies. Goenka told Cointelegraph:“Every citizen and business in this country should play their role in eliminating financing of illegitimate activities, regardless of whether such financing is done using legal tender, cryptocurrency, gold or any other medium. We welcome this move by the government and want to wholeheartedly support the government in this move. We encourage the government to work with our members, as we are committed to detect, report, and eliminate suspicious transactions in pretty much the same way as other institutions do.”Coinsecure CEO Mohit Kalra also reassured investors within the local cryptocurrency market that the government is not banning cryptocurrencies and it exchanges will operate as usual. Kaira advised customers not to be affected by the FUD and false reports issued over the past week.“According to Mr. Jaitley, they will be stopping illicit activities happening using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For us, it’s business as usual. Would advise customers not to panic sell at lower rates,” Kaira told Cointelegraph.Coinsecure COO Jincy Samuel emphasized that the cryptocurrency ban reports are nothing more than FUD, adding:“This is in no way different from the various other statements given in the recent past. Nothing new has been determined. Just seems like a lot of unnecessary media FUD.”"

The team is seeking to raise funds through an ICO to draw massive audiences and capital to the platform and to get more exposure on the market. Arbidex’s pre-sale garnered significant attention from both private and institutional investors.The campaign starts on January 23rd and will be running till February 15. The company plans to raise $10 M Arbidex token sale accepts ETH, BTC. The ABX token price is fixed at 1 ABX worth 1 USD. During the crowdsale 40% of ABX-tokens will be available for exchange based on a fixed formula. Remaining 60% will be distributed as follows: 29% to private placement and presale, 11% to the team, 10% to advisors and bounty program participants, 10% to reserve. ABX-token is based on Ethereum with the standard token interface ERC20. Token source code is available in White Paper. To participate in the crowdsale you need to login to Arbidex websiteUnlike many other overhyped blockchain projects, it looks the team behind Arbidex has already built an operating platform with a set of technical tools for an exchange arbitrage that is interacting with several cryptocurrency exchanges accumulating about 10 million US dollars in deposits. Technical architecture and the efficiency of arbitration strategy were tested over the 4-month period by the team with their own deposits.Arbidex aspires to minimize trading risks by accumulating liquidity from all major cryptocurrency exchanges and completely automate the arbitration process for the user. It is basically a trading platform designed to aggregate in one terminal crypto-assets and liquidity from all major exchanges with a capability to search for arbitration options and automatically implement them. The platform is able to analyze thousands of crypto-currency pairs and find most favorable ones making up to 2-3% revenue.Here’s an explanation of how it works. A trader signs up to the platform to start handling transactions with any amount he wants. Deploying a search algorithm for the most favorable exchange rates through multiple exchanges, the platform brings about the opportunity to buy cryptocurrency at a lower rate and sell at a higher. Also trading risks are insured by being shifting to the platform.

Any purchasing transaction with any tradable crypto-asset will be made at the most favorable rate, while the commissions charged by the platform are lower than regular ones charged by crypto-exchanges at the moment. ABX token is used at Arbidex platform. It is an access tool to the platform, as well as an internal accounting tool. We envision the platform to be designed for professional community of traders. Hence, members of our community - ABX tokens owners will be receiving an enhanced platform functionality that allows them to make extra profits from trading and arbitrage transactions, as well as the opportunity to develop it together with us. ABX Token has the following functionality: access to premium platform features; an internal settlement facility with an integrated discount on Arbidex service; the right to participate in the platform development.CEO Kamilya Arslanova says: ‘Since October 2017 my whole life has been devoted to the developing the most wanted trading platform of all times. No kidding! You probably know that difference between some coins and tokens prices might be up to 5% on different exchanges? But the trading ecosystem now is not providing any user-friendly tools for a trader to make money out of that. That’s why we invented Arbidex’.The official Token Sale starts on Jan 23 17:30 UTC. For more information please visit arbidex.uk.com and download the white paper.TelegramYoutubeMVPCompany name: ArbidexCompany site: https://arbidex.uk.com/Company contacts: mariastankevich@arbidex.ch"

Spending Bitcoin or any other digital currency is not currently all that easy. It takes time to convert back into fiat currency, and there is often a large fee.","A Singapore-based company Paycent aims to make it easier for buyers and sellers to use their digital currency. Right now they are in the process of releasing the integrated debit card which gives customers the capability to unlock their funds instantly.The overall goal of the company is to make it possible for mobile and cashless payments to be accepted anywhere. Blockchain is the underlying technology that enables this advancement, and the team has worked hard to bridge the gap between fiat and digital currencies.The new Paycent integrated debit card is the key to bringing digital currencies into our day-to-day life. It has no yearly maintenance fees if the card is active and in use. You don’t need to hold a PYN token to get it. A user will pay only one time fees for card activation and delivery with any digital currency.Pre-registration for the debit card has started on Jan. 15, and only 20,000 cards will be delivered in this first batch. The selling point for many of the early users of this card will be the low fee of 1.5 percent, paid in PYN tokens, which is much superior to the current transaction fees on most digital currencies.The hybrid wallet along with the debit card is planned to be live in the first week of March and it is currently available for registration on the Paycent website. Once operational, the card will work at more than 36 mln points in over 200 countries. Users will be able to convert any digital currency to fiat in real time basis and can use it via Paycent card at online and offline stores and cash withdrawal at ATMs globally.Paycent has set themselves apart in a few ways. One is the manner in which they are conducting their ICO. Rather than releasing all of their tokens at once, the team at Paycent decided to release them in eight phases.The company says, there are two major benefits to this method. First, it helps the protocol by proving the concept along the way, which would then result in more money being earned. It also increases transparency and aligns incentives within the network better. Users are motivated to buy earlier by giving bonus Paycent tokens (PYN) of varying amounts to each phase.The ICO commenced in November and has proven to be a success. Phase one of the ICO was successful, with 80 percent of tokens distributed to over 14,000 different contributors.Paycent’s end goal is to help users worldwide enter the cashless world. The true potential of a company like this comes from the fact it can create an infrastructure that users who have never had access to banks will be able to engage with. In this regard, it is an inspiring goal with limitless market potential.The original mission of Bitcoin was to create a new financial system that wasn’t dependent upon any single authority, and this might finally be possible with Paycent.The Paycent team is pro-active on Telegram.

OneCoin’s founder, Ruja Ignatova, is Bulgarian-born but has German citizenship.OneCoin, which promotes itself as a “centralized model [that] protects its members' safety and ensures compliance on AML [anti-money laundering],” does not fit the definition of a cryptocurrency, for it is not decentralized, does not run on open-source software, and does not have a public ledger.The documents and servers were seized from “One Network Services” EOOD, a Bulgarian company serving as a representative and distributor of OneCoin, as well as 14 other companies. 50 witnesses were questioned during the raid, but no arrests have yet been made.The company is registered officially in the United Arab Emirates as “OneCoin Ltd.,” but according to the Bulgarian police report, the company operates through“Hundreds of affiliated companies on 4 continents [...] [which] are being investigated in England, Ireland, Italy, the United States, Canada, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and many other countries.”A OneCoin representative faced charges of fraud in Kazakhstan in May 2017, and in India, police had arrested 23 people in connection with OneCoin’s pyramid scheme by July 2017.More recently, in August 2017, the Italian Antitrust and Consumer Protection Authority (AGCM) branded OneCoin a Ponzi scheme and fined them 2.5 mln euros, the first financial fine on the company.Cointelegraph has previously denounced OneCoin as a Ponzi scheme, warning readers to stay away from the coin."

Due to the weekend, independent confirmation has not been received. Calls to Friedman LLP have gone to voicemail.","It does seem unusual for either company to take such an action without issuing a formal statement, particularly since this would create a firestorm. Many in the crypto community have had concerns about whether Tether truly maintains adequate reserves to redeem all the outstanding tether tokens. The company had hired Friedman LLP to conduct an audit in an effort to resolve the community’s concern.Tether has been the source of much controversy for the past year, and the company has struggled to respond to critics. The company, which shares some of the same owners as Bitfinex, a major cryptocurrency exchange, wrote last fall:“Friedman LLP has been engaged to perform historical balance sheet audit procedures for Tether Limited. However, as the amount of Tethers in circulation has increased substantially in recent months, we have also asked Friedman to analyze our bank balances and our issued and outstanding token balance on an interim basis. Friedman agreed to perform consulting services for us in an effort to provide management with useful information concerning Tether’s cash position and Tether tokens issued and outstanding as of an interim date. Friedman was able to provide consulting services for us on an expedited basis, using a procedures date of September 15, 2017. These consulting services do not constitute an audit or attestation engagement, which would include a significantly expanded scope of procedures and take substantially more time to complete.”Any “dissolution” of the relationship between Tether and Friedman LLP would invite great suspicion from the community, as this would seem to run contrary to Tether’s desire for greater transparency.Tether (the company) claims to receive deposits of US dollars from investors, following which they create an equivalent number of tethers (the currency) and give those tethers to the depositor. Tether claims to have $2.2 bln on deposit in its bank accounts to back every tether token in existence on a 1:1 basis. Without an audit, though, it cannot be proven that Tether in fact has those reserves, or that they are not being used for something besides the backing of tether tokens.Some in the digital currency community have expressed deep skepticism over the issuance of tether tokens. It is not uncommon for the company to release massive amounts of tether, 50-100 mln at a time, which leaves many wondering who the investors are that deposit those funds. Since the disruption of Bitfinex’s banking relationships early last year, the exchange has become heavily dependent on its sister company’s tokens to move funds in and out of the exchange. Some have speculated that Tether may be operating a fractional reserve, issuing more tokens than they have backing for, and sending them to Bitfinex. The exchange then uses those tokens as collateral to create leveraged long or short positions in the Bitcoin market.Charlie Lee, the founder of Litecoin, has commented:There's a fear going on that the recent price rise was helped by printing of USDT (Tether) that is not backed by USD in a bank account.

I urge @bitfinex and @Tether_to to perform a 3rd party audit to prove their reserves. Please do the right thing. Thanks.In early December, Bitfinex threatened to “pursue legal action” against the anonymous blogger “Bitfinex’ed” based on his claims of wrongdoing on the part of Bitfinex and Tether.This story will be updated as more information becomes available."

connected to Bitcoin software could communicate with each other.","Jan 13, 2018","Cointelegraph launches a series of guides to different useful tools for the crypto community.  Newbies, experienced adherents and even gurus could find something interesting to upgrade their mastering of the subject. Life hacks from experts, pioneers, trailblazers, those who went through the mills of different crypto experiences themselves- firsthand and as simply put as possible.","Cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) markets are ones of the fastest changing in the world. As soon as the ICO-phenomenon started to gather serious traction at the beginning of 2017, every noticeable cryptocurrency blogger and media mentioned BitcoinTalk as one of the key success components, often referring to it as a source of the most desirable and target audience for any ICO project out there.All ICOs make announcement posts (ANN-posts) about themselves and majority of them launch their bounty campaigns on BitcoinTalk, while all trustworthy ICO listings require hyperlinks to ANN-posts when onboarding the projects. Thus, it can be said that at the moment, BitcoinTalk is a mandatory de-facto standard for any project doing or planning to do an Initial Coin Offering.The following guide to BitcoinTalk is based on thorough research on the subject, available information gathered and practical experience.  An exclusive collection of knowledge was tested along the story of a startup, which launched its ANN and bounty campaign posts on BitcoinTalk on Monday, Oct. 2. For the full first two weeks of the ICO campaign, no other user acquisition activities were made besides BitcoinTalk in order to receive a full understanding of how the platform worked and how it could help grow the project.Modern BitcoinTalk is the largest and one of the oldest message boards dedicated to Blockchain and cryptocurrencies on the Internet. It was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto on November 22, 2009, and is a direct successor to his first SourceForge forum, which is now lost.Initially, BitcoinTalk was a forum where people interested in technical details and everything connected to Bitcoin software could communicate with each other. Now it hosts a lot of different sections covering all the major areas of cryptocurrency world, including one made specifically for ICOs. Thanks to its huge user base (more than 464,000 community members) BitcoinTalk soon became a valuable traffic source for everything connected to cryptocurrency.The setupANN-post and everything connected with itIn order to be able to publish announcements and bounty posts, you need to have an account on the forum, but if you plan to do a beautiful “branded” post with images, your account should be at least in a rank of Jr. Member, which means having at least 30 activity points. In order to get that, you need to participate in forum’s life – communicate with other people in various forum threads.BitcoinTalk assigns points using the following scheme:One publication or comment = one activity point, but as soon as you reach 14 points, your score stops growing for the current two-week period. Despite this fact, your activity is being tracked and your points are being registered, but not assigned to your account at the moment.At the beginning of the following two-week period, the process starts again – your activity points continue to grow (even if you didn’t do anything during this new period, your previously registered activity points are now being assigned) until you reach next +14 points. This way, in order to gather the aforementioned 30 points you need to actively communicate on the forum for at least four weeks and two days. You need to keep this in mind if you plan to launch your announcement post by a certain date.You also need to note that your account might get banned along the way if you do a lot of off-topic posts and change your geo-IP often and inconsistently, so we suggest you start with at least five accounts that you plan to bring to Jr. Member rank. We had four, three of them got banned.Besides the in-house leveling up of BitcoinTalk accounts, there are two possible solutions to this situation:– change or regular Geo-IP– a complaint that accounts that you just bought was stolen– because some of the forum dwellers are inspecting users who actively communicate in the threads they are interested in, with the goal of finding high ranking accounts with unnatural behavioral patterns (e.g., account was inactive for three months and then started to positively comment in your thread only) in order to report them for unfair thread pumping.Usually, bans on BitcoinTalk are temporary, but receiving one may hinder your campaign a lot.In order to minimize the risks, we advise you create your own accounts and grow them till Jr. Member rank. You should start doing so at least one month and two days before your planned ANN-post release date.Here you can find the complete list of features and restrictions applicable to each account rank.In case you still want to risk and buy an account, we’ve studied the matter for you. Here are the prices you can encounter on the forums in late November – mid-December*:* Note: prices vary a lot, they depend on the vendor and account history, not solely on account rank, but given numbers do provide an actual understanding of the current market state.When buying an account on BitcoinTalk, it is strongly advised to use an escrow service. Escrows are experienced and respected high ranking forum members that act as the third party in your arrangement and guarantee that your deal will be concluded without fraud. Below you can find a list of BitcoinTalk members that could be contacted on the matter of providing escrow services. The list is descending – the man with the highest trust rating is displayed above. The structure is as follows: nickname, commission escrow takes from the deal, minimum reward sum escrow receives in any case*:* openly available numbers, you can try to lower them by contacting any of the mentioned users in personal messages.It’s a well-known fact that beautiful imagery sells better than naked text, it engages the user and holds his attention, it can bring additional value and help to favorably position your product against the competition.On BitcoinTalk you can create both simple and discreet posts, as well as rich and beautiful publications full of images, but there are many nuances that you should know before deciding which type of ANN-post you should go for.BitcoinTalk is not a mobile-friendly platform. There is no direct option to make an adaptive ANN/Bounty post design for mobile devices, but default layout is fluid, meaning that all your text and imagery will be scaled down to meet the current resolution requirements. You may take that into account when preparing your design and make the content of your images bigger than needed so that it would look better on mobile phones, but it’s totally up to you.During the first two weeks after our initial launch, we didn’t do any advertising or bring additional traffic to our website, receiving only what BitcoinTalk has to offer and that what came organically. We saw that most of the traffic came from desktop (more than 85 percent), that's why we dare to conclude that trying to make your ANN-post “mobile-friendly” is an ineffective approach.Another feature of BitcoinTalk’s fluid layout is that elements that are specifically positioned in a single row. For example, [img][/img][img][/img], when viewing on a mobile device, can break this row and create a second line, despite the fact that there is enough horizontal space for them in the initial row.BitcoinTalk, as many other forums use BBcode to markup its content inside the publications. Implementation of BBcode is a rather standard one but restricted. We would even say old to be precise. Working with multilevel ordered and unordered lists, for example, is a more complicated process than it is on modern phpBB/IPB forum-boards.Post should be marked up and tested in personal messages (My messages → New message). You should send your post layout to yourself or your other account so that no one would complain about you sending spam in personal messages.Before sending your test message, you can look at its preview-version, which might show you how your post would look like once published, but unfortunately, it’s not completely true. In preview version of the post, CSS styles that are applied to pictures with hyperlinks are different from the ones applied in real post. This can trash your complex layout if you don’t know about it in advance. When a post is published, all pictures wrapped in links receive an additional margin-left: 4px (four transparent pixels are added from the left side of the picture), but you can’t see this effect in the Preview mode.Here’s an example of this effect in ELIX’s ANN-post:Now that you know this nuance, all iterations of your post layout should be sent to you in personal messages and afterwards examined in My messages →Inbox (sent messages do count as published posts and BitcoinTalk uses same CSS styles on them).During this step, additional nuances that slow down your working speed appear. If you mark up and test your post layout with a freshly registered user, then each time you press Preview or Send Message, you’ll need to enter a captcha (fortunately, it doesn’t change for a few hours, so you would be able to remember it by heart). For new users (<16 activity points) these personal message sending restrictions apply:Based on this information, we once again strongly advice to create several accounts on BitcoinTalk and in case of encountering this limits, start doing the same thing, but from different account.Nota bene: Unfortunately, recently BitcoinTalk forced same image-posting policies to personal messages that it uses in publications. This means that if your account rank is lower than Jr. Member, you can publish only text (image tags will be converted into hyperlinks), even in private messages.In order to simplify the ANN-post markup process (i.e,. not to make everything from scratch), you can take any post markup as a basis. It’s very easy to do, but generally, people who don’t work with forums don’t know about it.Let’s say you like the UTRUST post. In order to see its BBcode markup, you need to log in to BitcoinTalk and press the quote button:As soon as you do that, window with reply comment will appear, where in the body of the text message a BBcode of UTRUST’s ANN-post will be “quoted.” Everything you need is located inside the tags [quote] and [/quote]. Just copy this code and continue to work with it locally:BitcoinTalk doesn’t host your images, i.e., you can’t upload pictures to their servers when designing a post, like you can on Medium. You can refer to an image that is already uploaded to a server, preferably your own (with the same domain name as your website), using a hyperlink. If you don’t have a personal dedicated server where you store images, or for some reason, you don’t want to do so, you can use image hosting services such as:This is where another nuance appears – BitcoinTalk Image Proxy. Theoretically, it was designed to block the loading of the images that exceed 2.5 megabytes in size, but in practice, it periodically blocks the rendering of images from different hostings for no apparent reason, showing you the following message: “bitcointalk.org image proxy: invalid image.”The main problem here is that your ANN-post images can trigger Image Proxy not when they are rendered for the first time, but three days after the publication, making your post look broken (this is exactly what happened to us).It is advised to upload your complete image set to different hosting services from the very beginning and prepare several BBCode copies of your post with different image links. In case you encounter this Image Proxy behavior, you will be ready to react to this situation by editing the post and instantly changing all broken images to new, working ones – this way you will minimize your reputation risks. In our tests, we found out that it is safer to use Imgur hosting services. This is probably so because Imgur is most popular image hosting service right now and a lot of companies host their ANN and Bounty post images there, so hindering it with Image Proxy is disadvantageous for the forum in whole.Another thing to note: you can encounter a situation where you open your published post (or sent personal message) and find some images not being rendered at all. This is a standard situation – no need to worry, just refresh the page a few times. This happens a lot and most of the BitcoinTalk commoners know about it, so they will easily refresh your page if needed.All beautiful, selling ANN-posts are made of images – some projects use small amounts of pictures, but very large ones, while others use a lot of small images. Because all images are examined by BitcoinTalk Image Proxy, their loading speed isn’t something to be desired. The general rule of thumb here is that the lesser the size of your images, the faster they load and less Image Proxy related problems are encountered.In order to decrease your image size – they should be optimised, preferably using lossless algorithms.These services can help you to achieve this goal:For anyone who wishes to dive deep into this topic, we advise to take a look at these materials:Do you really need to bother, how effective this can be? Let’s compare ANN post of our project – Forty Seven Bank and ANN post of Tokenbox. Our image canvas is a lot longer than one of Tokenbox. We have more graphical content.Forty Seven: 38 images, total file size – 824 kilobytes;Tokenbox: 8 images, total file size – 2.26 megabytes.The difference is 2.74 times.In terms of markup specifics, all posts can be divided into four distinct types. Each of them has their own advantages and disadvantages.Example – Ethereum Blue.Advantages:Disadvantages:Term simple graphical post implies a canvas that almost fully consists of few or even one single image, which is created using some kind of graphical tool. This type of post is laid out using a rule “one image per row.”Example – UTRUST.Advantages:Disadvantages:Complex graphical ANN post is a post that is sliced and marked up in such a way that all images NOT covered in links have additional four transparent/background color pixels from the left side and all images that ARE covered in links do not. This type of post can have several image-links placed in one row (e.g., you can have image-links of your documents placed in one horizontal line).Examples: Forty Seven Bank, eGoldAdvantages:Disadvantages:Hybrid post in a topic that uses a combination of images and richly formatted text.Examples: Sintez, BPC, Tokenbox.Advantages:Disadvantages:Most of the people who’ll participate in your translation bounty campaign are professional bounty hunters, whose goal is to deliver their work as fast as possible and receive their promised steaks (bounty campaign points). They don’t care much about the visual quality of their work if it slows them down. For example, you’ve launched your graphical ANN and bounty posts on the first day of the month but were able to prepare properly sliced Photoshop files with graphical content only on the second day. Most of the bounty hunters, in this case, would already have started translating your posts on day one. Because they didn’t have the Photoshop source files available to them on day one, they would work with what is – raster images from your posts. They will be able to change the texts in your images, but the quality of such alterations will be questionable, resulting in localized posts looking worse than original ones. These situations can be solved later on, but it requires time, which is of essence during the ICO campaign and that’s why it is utterly important to have all your properly sliced Photoshop files ready on day one.Most of the bounty hunters are familiar with image editors and have them installed on their machines. Mostly the ones from Adobe, but often the versions of programs they use are very outdated (Adobe Photoshop CS2-3, Adobe Fireworks CS5-6), that’s why when preparing the sliced Photoshop files, we suggest you merge as many layers as possible, leaving only the text editable. We also suggest not to use new Adobe CC features such as double or triple gradient layer effects, artboards, etc. The simpler your file is, the more predictable result you get from a bounty hunter.It’s not a commonly known fact, but it is possible to place a whole email template, with recipient address, subject, and body text set in advance in a regular “mailto:” link. It is very convenient for a person who decided to write you an email – it will save him a lot of time if he encounters such link. Here’s an example that offers a visitor to become project’s advisor. These type of links also work In terms of BitcoinTalk, but you have to place them using [email][/email] tag, not the [url][/url]. You can also wrap images in [email] tags the same way you do it with [url].Posts on BitcoinTalk cannot be infinitely long, they have a character limit set, but if you encounter it, forum will just show you an error about you having an improperly closed tag somewhere in your post, i.e., will misinform you. Officially the characters limit for one post is 64,000 symbols, but in some cases this limit fired at 63,000+ characters, while others reported they were able to publish posts with 65,535 and 68,575 characters in length respectively. Besides that, this restriction is a floating one. It varies from one forum section to another. In Tokens (altcoins) and Bounties (altcoins) it is approximately the same as mentioned above, but in Russian localized section, for example, the allowed character amount was two times smaller.You’ll probably won’t encounter this limit while publishing your ANN post, but it will come in handy when doing a bounty post.Based on the experience of launching our own ANN and bounty posts and making a lot of changes to them, the conclusion would be that it’s better to do hybrid ANN posts, because:It is better not to use image-links for ANN posts in different languages, but rather to make them text ones, otherwise it could create a lot of additional work for the creator as well as for the bounty campaign participants.It looks beautiful, but because there are around 16-20 main languages that your ANN post will be translated to, you and your bounty hunters will have to create these 16-20 images for each language, resulting in around 256-400 images. It’s just not worth it.Before you publish your ANN post, there are several things you should know.Each day dozens of new ANN posts appear on BitcoinTalk and dozens of “old” ones ascend to top positions of the section because of the active discussions happening in them. Tokens (altcoins) section is somewhat similar to very dynamic Featured section of some kind of popular App Store – all market participants want to get their place under the sun, because it provides visibility to the project, which in return gives free traffic.It would be discussed later - how to get to the top of the section, but right now we will speak about how to get noticed when you’re already on the top. All headings in the section are made of text and mostly all of them have blocks in brackets, such as [ANN][ICO]. In order to better distinguish your post you can use ASCII symbols and emojis – you won’t get banned for this:Using these symbols, you can better draw attention to your post and easier onboard new visitors to your topic.For example, instead of using normal square brackets [EXAMPLE], you can use these symbols【EXAMPLE】that by default have thicker lines to them and are better drawing attention. If to wrap this example in emoji, then your heading will distinct even better, for instance ?【EXAMPLE】?.That’s it, but it is important not to overdo it.The most often encountered emojis on BitcoinTalk are:? ⚡??✅?⭐Tokens (altcoins) section is always monitored by bounty hunters, especially by translators. As soon as they see new post appear, they jump into it and instantaneously leave a reply message with text stating something similar to “I reserve the Indonesian translation.” This is all good and well, despite the fact that it’s better to be able to reserve the first reply message for yourself – you can use it for thread updates or at least have an opportunity to divide your main post in two if it gets too big.After the publication of your ANN post, the tab you’ve published it in usually loads slower than the entry appears in the altcoins section, so in order to reserve the first reply for yourself, you need to do:If you’ve done everything fast enough, first post reply will be yours and you will be able to use it as intended (by editing its content). In case you weren’t able to make it (bounty hunters are very fast after all), you’ll have to use your main post’s footer to publish the updates.In order to reduce the risk of losing your first reply message to bounty hunters, we advise to publish your ANN post when there are less people on the forum. BitcoinTalk is an international platform, meaning that there are always users online, but we definitely recommend avoiding publishing your post from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. EST.There are many things you can do right after publishing your ANN post, depending on how well did you prepare for the guerilla community management, but there’s a minimum program you should do.If you’ve made a high-quality attractive ANN post, you will start receiving your first comments about participation in bounty program, language translation reservations and general questions about your project within the first minutes. It is very important to respond to those comments promptly and in full while staying polite and positive. Keeping your FAQ close to increase your answer speed is generally a good idea. If you manage to respond to people’s questions while offering them a way to continue a conversation with you, you will get into victorious situation. Every time someone leaves a comment in your post, it jumps up to the top of Tokens (altcoins) section. There it receives visibility, that’s why the more discussion is happening in your post, the more popular it gets. You have to remember that BitcoinTalk moderators are working for a salary, not for free, so they do their job well – all off-topic posts and pointless comments are quickly deleted.Even participating in topic discussions, you need to keep an eye on personal messages – a place where you’ll receive offers of paid help from different forum dwellers. Some of the offered services may be of use to you, but in any case, you should always be wary and check the reputation of users who are offering them.During the first few hours after the publication of your ANN-post, we suggest you keep at least two people watching the thread and answering user comments and questions.When launching local ANN posts in different languages, prepare that some people may be very salty and even poisonous. You still need to behave politely with them.This is where this article comes to an end. Next one would be about specifics of bounty campaigns on BitcoinTalk.

This has been a particular problem in recent months, as buyers flocked to get their hands on Bitmain’s Bitcoin S9 miners, as well as their Dash D3 and Litecoin L3+ miners.We are proud and happy to announce that we are launching the Antminer A3, a new Antminer model to mine cryptocurrencies using the hashing algorithm Blake(2b).
The actual price and option to buy will be available here https://t.co/mrymOaMy4i after 2:30PM (17 Jan, GMT+8). pic.twitter.com/Ye0cxNn95MThe announcement of the Antminer A3 launch came out of the blue and has already caused a stir in the mining community due to its focus on the Blake(2b) hashing algorithm.As it stands, the Blockchain cloud storage service Sia uses Siacoin as its cryptocurrency, which is mined using the Blake(2b) algorithm.Nebulous Labs, the studio behind Sia, launched its own ASIC cryptocurrency miner Obelisk which has been in presale since 2017. Two miners are available, the Decred cryptocurrency miner DC1 and the Siacoin miner SC1. The first batch has already sold out and is expected to ship in June of this year.Bitmain’s surprise announcement effectively muscles in on the market before Obelisk has shipped its new SC1 miners. The Chinese mining company has promised delivery within 10 days following full payment.This has not gone unnoticed, and Obelisk founder David Vorick posted a stern warning to Bitmain on the Obelisk Reddit forum, hinting at a soft fork that would disable the Bitmain A3 units from being able to mine the coin.“Bitmain has a long history of being abusive towards coin communities, their customers and towards coin developers. We prepared for something like this by adding an extra feature to the SC1. We can do a soft fork that slightly changes the PoW algorithm which would invalidate the Bitmain ASICs, but allow the SC1 units to continue working. In the event of an attack from Bitmain, we can activate this soft fork.”The Obelisk founder and Sia lead developer, known by his nickname taek, made it clear that a move like that would be a last resort to protect users that have preordered Obelisk miners.“At this time, I do not think it is necessary, but if they start mining empty blocks or otherwise prove problematic for the network, we have recourse that does not involve destroying the usefulness of the SC1 units. This fork would, of course, require community adoption, it's not something the devs could decide to activate on their own. It would be a UASF because the majority hashrate would not be standing behind the soft fork.” In a parting shot, Vorick said a final decision on the correct course of action rests in the hands of the mining community. “Overall, I do not think we have much to worry about. Hopefully (and very likely), this soft fork will never be necessary. But I wanted to remind everyone (including Bitmain) that, at the end of the day, it is the community that has control, not the miners. If ASIC manufacturers act in a way that is harmful to the network, we have recourse.”According to Obelisk’s website, 3,598 SCI units were sold in the first preorder batch. 1,585 SCI units have been sold to date in the second presale batch.Bitmain’s mining pools, Antpool and BTC.com, account for over 29 percent of the world’s hashing power, which some experts believe challenges the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Furthermore its estimated that 70 percent of the world’s Bitcoin miners use Antpool hardware.Business is ruthless, and Bitmain’s secret launch of the Antminer A3s show that they are looking to outfox their competitors at every turn.Bitmain hasn’t broken any rules, but it's good to see that Obelisk are willing to stand up and make preeminent moves of their own. But once again, it's likely that the mining community will have the final say."

"" ...","Jan 28, 2018",Portugal’s Central Bank Director Hélder Rosalino said that he didn't consider cryptocurrency a currency or legal tender and hinted that the Central Bank of Portugal has a similar position.,"His views are in line with many countries around the world, including the US where “a cryptocurrency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.”The Finance Minister of Portugal Mario Centano, who is also the president of the Eurogroup,  said last December that he is looking to European regulatory guidance concerning cryptocurrencies since they are ""overseeing the general picture."" The Eurogroup is a group of nineteen finance ministers of EU countries, who meet once a month to talk about major economic and monetary policies that are implemented across the EU. Finance ministers from France, Germany and the UK have proposed that cryptocurrency regulation should be coordinated at a global level with discussions taking center stage at the next upcoming G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina.   As the Portuguese banking and finance regulators hint at and seek a coordinated regulatory solution for cryptocurrencies– their extreme price volatility with tsunami-like price fluctuations have Portuguese banks spooked, to no end.   When in December 2017 Bitcoin’s price first surged 100 percent to $20,000 and then nose-dove 50 percent in value, bringing down the prices of all other cryptocurrencies in its wake, Banco Santander-Portugal, the fourth largest Portuguese bank, shuttered their customer’s cryptocurrency trading activity.As a backlash, more than 1,000 its customers signed a petition stating that the bank was deviating from the financial innovation trend and was ignoring the unhinged technological shift towards Blockchain technology all over the world. Some customers even went to file complaints with the DECO, country's consumer protection organization.Caving to customer pressure after admitting that the Santander Group began using Blockchain technology in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reduce costs and make cross-border payment transactions more efficient, Banco Santander-Portugal changed its policy about shutting down its customer’s cross-border cryptocurrency trades at foreign cryptocurrency exchanges like Luxembourg-based Bitstamp and US-based Coinbase.  “We are committed to creating a leading international Blockchain payment ecosystem that presents significant opportunity for cross-border payments globally,” explained José Luis Calderón, the global head of Santander Global Transaction Banking. Banco Santander-UK began working with American Express and the Ripple network, to allow American Express' US business customers to make instant, traceable cross-border non-card payments using the Blockchain network – RippleNet – to Banco Santander-UK.“We’re taking a huge step forward with American Express and Santander to solve the problems customers experience with slow cross-border global payments,” Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple revealed. RippleNet provides optional access to Ripple (XRP), which as of Jan. 28, 2018, is the third largest by market capitalization cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin and Ethereum.Released in 2012, Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" It supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodity or any other unit of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes.  Currently, Ripple requires two parties for a transaction to occur: a regulated financial institution ""holds funds and issues balances on behalf of customers"" while ""market makers"" such as hedge funds or currency trading desks provide liquidity in the currency they want to trade in. In addition to Banco Santander, over 100 banks and payment networks have adopted RippleNet as a settlement infrastructure technology.  As Banco Santander-Portugal began restating its customers’ ability to trade cross-border on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, more good news arrived.Personal income taxation does not apply to cryptocurrency gains in Portugal.  “A recent binding ruling from the Portuguese tax administration says that gains from the sale of cryptocurrency are not taxed in Portugal unless the individual taxpayer carries on a business or professional activity and earns said income in that context (profit). The tax administration acknowledges that this sale is not taxable as personal income, particularly as capital income or capital gains. Thus, unless the individual taxpayer carries on an active trade or business concerning cryptocurrencies, income from the sale or purchase of cryptocurrency is not subject to tax in the context of the Personal Income Tax (PIT) code, Rogerio Fernandes Ferreira, the lead tax partner at international law firm Rogerio Fernandes Ferreira & Associados pointed out.Taxation may only take place when its regularity constitutes a business or professional activity for the taxpayer.“Portugal does not charge a “cross-border tax” in addition to or as an alternative to the personal income tax,” Ferreira addedHowever, since Portuguese individual taxpayers may undertake cross-border cryptocurrency transactions on a foreign crypto exchange – they may be subject to cross-border taxes imposed by a foreign country that may be minimized or eliminated under an income tax treaty.  Recently the EU Commission has prepared draft tax legislation on the digital economy, which calls for formulating an appropriate proposal, with cooperation with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and other international partners. While the Portuguese consumer protection association DECO has appealed to the Ministry of Finance, and the European commissioner in charge of consumer defense, proposing that individual cryptocurrency gains in Portugal should be taxed in the same manner as stocks.DECO’s tax proposal has similarities to the method in which the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes cryptocurrency gains. The IRS characterizes cryptocurrencies as property. This means that every time a cryptocurrency is transferred, it might trigger a gain, subject to US taxation. A cryptocurrency held as a capital asset by a taxpayer would be taxed as capital gains. A cryptocurrency held as inventory or for resale by a taxpayer would be taxed as ordinary income. If it is used as a means of payment, it would be treated like a currency, converted to fiat at its fair market value as disclosed on a cryptocurrency exchange and taxed as ordinary income.Since cryptocurrencies are used in cross-border transactions, US sourced cryptocurrency gains of non-resident taxpayers would be subjected to a withholding tax that could be reduced or eliminated under an income tax treaty. For these purposes, the cryptocurrency-related income traded over the Internet would be determined under the international communications source rules.In summary, it can be said that Portuguese individual taxpayers who are increasingly excited about trading cryptocurrencies cross-border on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges are urged take into consideration the tax laws in all the jurisdictions they trade in and store their cryptocurrencies in secure foreign wallets to avoid hacking risks.Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for TaxNotes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.

The six plaintiffs stated that their personal losses amounted to $771,000.It is alleged that BitConnect guaranteed a 40 percent monthly return that it promised to generate by trading the investors’ funds on the cryptocurrency market.Ultimately, the plaintiffs claim that instead of genuinely generating revenue via cryptocurrency trading, the platform actually used the funds from new investors to meet the expectations of the existing ones.Launched in February 2016, BitConnect was a cryptocurrency community platform which introduced its own cryptocurrency Bitconnect coin (BCC) in November 2016.According to data from Coinmarketcap, the BCC has reached the peak of its popularity in Dec. 2017, when its market capitalization hit about $2.7 bln.Just days later, on Jan. 4, the state of Texas issued a cease and desist order against BitConnect for the selling of unlicensed securities which has led to the crash of the BCC token and the platform’s closure.Meanwhile, BitConnect has managed to attract a different kind of attention by releasing a bizarre video from its annual ceremony in New York.In it, the company’s eccentric representative Carlos Matos claims that his own investment in BitConnect has paid off several times over. “My wife still doesn’t believe me,” said Matos, describing how rich he has become. "

... but probably everyone in your family would still like some Bitcoin 
or ...","Jan 7, 2018","Even though cryptocurrencies are getting more and more exposure, their legislation seems to be a grey area for most governments, especially when it comes to declaring your income in digital currencies. The Internal Revenue Service, the US tax collection agency, has issued Notice 2014-21 stating that Bitcoin and altcoins are subjects to federal income and payroll taxes. So what to do with your crypto money and how to declare your taxes right?","Let’s start with the dreary subject of records. Yes, that applies to crypto investors too. You’d better have some if you are thinking about taxes. If you’ve ever tried to tell the IRS “I lost my receipt,” you don’t want to do it a second time.The IRS has heard every excuse in the book. While it is not without sympathy, you’ll find it far easier not having to go to the additional effort of proving something by another means. Periodically, the IRS issues reminders to taxpayers regarding the importance of safeguarding your tax records.That’s especially true in cases of natural disasters that make traditional record-keeping go haywire. But think of it year-round wherever you are. The IRS suggests creating a backup set of records stored away from the originals. It is good advice for crypto investors.If you are sitting on some big gains, you might consider how your tax picture will look for the entire year. It isn’t too soon to start thinking this way. In fact, try to do it long before year-end so you can make adjustments. You might want to sell or hedge some, even if you think the market is still headed up.There is a lot more than taxes involved in such decisions. But it can be wise to at least think about it. For example, what if your tax year already has a big capital loss in it, or you have a big carryover loss from prior years? In general, unused capital losses can be used to absorb up to $3,000 per year in ordinary income.But unless you have capital gains to offset your capital losses that $3,000 would be the extent of your tax benefit. Some people sit for years and years with unused capital losses that carryover each year. So, if you also have unrealized capital gains, you might consider selling some gain assets, to be able to absorb your losses. Run some numbers and see how it looks.Another topic as tax time nears is to ask whether you really know what you are selling. That is, if you have 100 Bitcoins and you sell 10, which 10 did you sell? There is no perfect answer to this question. Most of the tax law considers shares of stock, not cryptocurrency.  However, many advisers think that the same kinds of rules should be applied in the case of multiple crypto assets that you hold. If so, specific identification of what you are selling, when you bought it, and for what purchase price, is likely to be the cleanest. But that may not be possible.Some people use an averaging convention, where you essentially average your cost across a number of purchases. Consistency and record-keeping are important. You don’t want the IRS to claim that you denied the government its fair share of each sale. And remember, if you are claiming long-term capital gain treatment, being able to prove that you held the cryptocurrency for more than a year before selling is key.Loaning money shouldn’t be a taxable event to either the borrower or the lender, except for interest payments. So, can you loan out your cryptocurrency to people? You can, but the question is whether that loan will be treated the same as a loan of money by the IRS.The jury is still out on that question. The IRS says cryptocurrency is property for tax purposes. You don’t want the loan and the repayment (of different cryptocurrency?) to be treated as taxable dispositions. Some of it may depend on your documents, and how much you make it look and feel like a real loan.Hedges of cryptocurrency are another hot topic to consider. Hedges can help to avoid some of the volatility that has characterized the various crypto markets. But be careful that you are doing your best to avoid a disposition, meaning a sale for tax purposes, that you don’t want.The holidays may be over, but probably everyone in your family would still like some Bitcoin or other crypto issues. The prices have been so ever-present in the news, that gifts and donations are still very much in the news. But is it smart tax-wise?A charitable contribution would be the best type of transfer. If you give to a qualified charity, you should get an income tax deduction for the full fair market value of the crypto. If you bought for $500, and donate to a 501(c)(3) charity when it is worth $15,000, you should get a $15,000 charitable contribution deduction. What’s more, you won’t have to pay the capital gain tax on the $14,500 spread.Giving to private parties is not as impressive. The same gift to your niece gets you no tax deduction. And it requires you to file a gift tax return since the gift is worth more than $15,000. For 2018, $15,000 is the amount of so-called “annual exclusion” gifts you can give to any number of people each year with no reporting required.Any gifts over that $15,000 amount require a gift tax return, even though you probably won’t pay any gift tax. You normally would use up a small portion of your lifetime exclusion from gift and estate tax. For 2018, that number just went up dramatically. The amount you can transfer tax-free during your life or on death just went up to $11.2 mln per person. That is $22.4 mln per married couple.Finally, don’t forget about the coming onslaught of IRS Forms 1099. Normally, these not-so-fun little tax forms arrive around the end of January, reporting income paid to you in the previous calendar tax year. The IRS says that wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable, must be reported on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.Similarly, payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors are taxable to them, and payers who are engaged in business must issue Form 1099. A payment made using virtual currency is subject to Form 1099 reporting just like any other payment made in property. That means if a person in business pays virtual currency worth $600 or more to an independent contractor for services, Form 1099 is required.If you are a recipient of Form 1099, as most everyone is, keep track of them. Each one gets reported to the IRS and applicable state tax authorities. If you don’t report or otherwise address the reported income on your tax return, you can expect that the IRS will follow up.This may seem confusing, but you shouldn’t worry. The IRS is usually much more lenient to those who fill in taxes, even with mistakes, rather than to those who avoid doing it at all."

Secured under Mongolian leadership, during the Pax Mongolica period, the Silk Road was particularly safe from raiders as well as taxes, which stimulated free trade between China and the Mediterranean countries enabling political, economic stability to follow.Recently the Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed a cyber-initiative grander in scale than Pax Mongolica after consulting with Ethereum co-founder Blockchain expert Vitalik Buterin and experts from fifteen other countries- including the US, India, Israel, Armenia and Turkey- about their Blockchain and cryptocurrency initiatives. Putin’s first of it’s kind cyber-initiative will connect some of the most promising emerging market economies stretching across Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and South America, via Blockchain and smart contract technology by using a new multinational cryptocurrency to be collectively adopted by the BRICS and the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) countries (Member States).Member States, known for their tremendous economic growth potential, could hail this first of its kind cyber-initiative. As they have been reeling from the global credit crisis of 2007/2008, which hindered their economies. Federal rate increases augmented their mounting debt burdens and falling global commodity prices stymied their export led growth. The cyber-initiative could reshape Member State economies, by spurring technological innovation for income growth and economic prosperity.As reported by Russian media source RT, days before the end of 2017, the Central Bank of Russia, proposed to create the first joint multinational cryptocurrency for BRICS and EEU countries. By jointly adopting a new cryptocurrency, the Member States could increase their investments in Blockchain, smart contract technology pushing towards creating cashless societies and improve managing their liquidities with substantial support from the New Development Bank.Many economists, veteran bankers and traditional financial institutions have sought to downplay the influence of cryptocurrencies in the overall world economy, such as the German insurance giant Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian who said: ‘‘Bitcoin’s price will explode, but mass adoption is not going to happen.”But if adopted and implemented, the first multinational cryptocurrency could be used by more than 41 percent of the world’s population. It could potentially improve trade efficiency among the Member States by replacing other fiat currencies used in trade settlements. And it could create a technologically resourceful trade block that could reshape global trade via Blockchain and smart contract technology.However, for this initiative to succeed, among other things, Member State transnational legislation concerning cryptocurrencies would need to be updated in a synchronized fashion. As currently there are substantial differences between Member State legislation concerning cryptocurrencies as summarized in the table below.  Based on instructions from President Vladimir Putin, Russia’s central bank and finance ministry jointly prepared a bill for the regulation of сryptocurrencies and ICOs which was submitted to the Duma for approval on Dec. 28, 2017. The bill is expected to be adopted in March and finalized by July 1, 2018.The bill characterizes cryptocurrency, including ICO tokens not as legal tender but as “other property.”The bill allows for ICOs but establishes restrictions on them. Those who are not qualified investors will be able to purchase tokens of a certain type for an amount not exceeding 50 thousand Rubles ($869). The ministry also suggests limiting the maximum amount of funds raised by an ICO to one bln Rubles ($17.4 mln). Although the President of the Russian Association of cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RABIC), Yuri Pripachkin, argued: “ICO fundraising should not be limited as they can attract an unlimited amount of foreign investments to Russian projects.”Presently mining and trading of cryptocurrencies is not regulated under Russian laws. The bill defines cryptocurrency mining and trading as a taxable activity. Individual entrepreneurs and legal entities could engage in cryptocurrency mining and trading activities, subject to tax by analogy with the taxation of business activities.Cryptocurrency trading would not be subject to a value-added tax (VAT).The bill does not address cross-border tax rules that could apply to transnational cryptocurrency transactions among Member States in the event the new multinational cryptocurrency is adopted.Member States, with the exception of Armenia, Belarus, Iran and Kyrgyzstan adhere to OECD BEPS action plan. It is not clear whether Member States will follow an approach similar to the EU in formulating an appropriate transnational tax policy for their new multinational сryptocurrency transactions.Disclaimer.

It covers everything from Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ICO regulation and investment analysis. If you want to become our guest author and get published on Cointelegraph, please send us an email at mike@cointelegraph.com.","After reading about how a partner in one of the biggest and most prestigious international law firms was busted by an undercover US Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agent for trying to garner Bitcoins in a corrupt transaction from a Silicon Valley tech company, it’s likely you won’t feel sad about smart contracts beginning to take over certain functions of lawyers. You might even secretly thank Ethererum’s co-inventor Vitalik Buterin, for it.   A calm lobby of Hilton Garden Hill in Cupertino, CA was transformed into a crime scene exactly at 9:55:10 am on Jan. 31, 2017 when a man, shrieked “my life is over” as he was being handcuffed and arrested by FBI agent William Scanlon. The arrested man was using a fake name “Dan” and wearing an obvious wig to disguise his identity.  Unfortunately, his cover was blown when Scanlon, who worked at FBI’s public corruption division, identified him in his report as no other than Jeffrey Wertkin, a partner at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld who was an ex-US Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutor.Apparently, Wertkin, while still working at the DOJ in Washington DC, stole whistleblower complaints brought against a Silicon Valley tech company, which was sealed from public view.   To give the tech company a leg up in the government’s ongoing investigation and to obstruct justice, Wertkin tried selling these sealed whistleblower complaints against the tech company, in exchange for 310 “untraceable” Bitcoins worth $310,000, but was instead busted by the FBI.Wertkin’s dreams of becoming an “undetectable” Bitcoin millionaire was shattered on Nov. 29, 2017 -- when Bitcoin was trading at $7,000 – and when he pleaded guilty to two charges of obstruction of justice and one count of transporting stolen goods across state lines. DOJ prosecutors said they would seek 30 to 37 months of prison time when he’s sentenced on March 14, 2018. The law firm has since fired Wertkin.It should be noted that Bitcoins are ill-suited for corrupt transactions. Because, Bitcoin transactions are tracked and made public using Blockchain, which is a digital ledger distributed over a network of computers rather than located on a single or multiple servers. Transactions made in Bitcoins are recorded chronologically and publicly. It is almost impossible to alter the historical records on a Blockchain and more importantly, access to a Blockchain can also be restricted.   Buterin explained, “All transactions under Blockchain come with auditable trails of cryptographic proofs.  Rather than simply hoping that the parties we interact with behave honorably, we are building Blockchains that inherently build the properties in the system, in such a way that they will keep functioning with the guarantees that we expect, even if many of the actors involved are corrupt.”The Blockchain’s main disruptive element in today’s commercial and economic ecosystem is its ability to eliminate the necessity to trust intermediaries to certify a transaction. This feature lends Ethereum Blockchain well to being used to create smart contracts.Smart contracts are computer protocols, or algorithms, which can verify the negotiation process or performance of contracts--to the extent, legal relationships can be reduced neatly into code-whereby clauses are automatically enforced once the pre-programmed conditions are satisfied. They are coded instructions, which execute on the occurrence of an event.“‘Smart contracts’ – can automatically move digital assets, including ‘contracts’ according to arbitrary pre-specified rules, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code,” explained Buterin.Lawyers realize that smart contract technology will be an unstoppable disruptive force for the profession.  For example, Blockchain’s ledger with the inalterability of the data, mixed with smart contracts could help clients create an immutable, time-stamped and legally-defensible record of when a trademark or copyright is first used. Thus, should a client pursue registration of said mark, the evidence would be there to leverage the option in their favor. The Blockchain is the perfect mechanism for achieving these goals because by nature records in a Blockchain network are time-stamped, secured and scalable.On Jan. 9, 2018 Kodak, a camera manufacturer, announced the launch of its KodakCoin cryptocurrency utilizing Blockchain security technology, a digital ledger of rights ownership for photographers to register both new and archive work that they can then license within the platform aimed at enabling image rights management for photographers. Using the Blockchain for copyright registration and tracking makes sense, so the company’s stock price shot up 89 percent upon this announcement.""With KodakCoin, participating photographers are invited to take part in a new economy for photography, receive payment for licensing their work immediately upon sale and for both professional and amateur photographers, sell their work confidently on a secure Blockchain platform,"" Kodak said.The camera company's ""photo-centric"" cryptocurrency is being launched in an ICO to accredited investors who meet the financial threshold of-- either $200,000 in income or $1 mln of net worth - from the US, UK, Canada and other select countries under a licensing partnership with Wenn Digital. It will also involve a Blockchain-backed image rights management platform called KodakOne.On a separate note, Kodak on the same day also announced a new Bitcoin mining rig leasing business line called “KashMiner.” Users of KodakCoin and KashMiner are urged to take into consideration the US as well as cross-border tax implications when evaluating the overall economics of transactions utilizing Kodak’s new virtual currency based products."

#TenX · #Tezos. Related ...","Jan 10, 2018","Around $6 bln has been raised via ICOs in 2017. Almost 37 percent of that amount was made by only 20 ICOs. Names like Filecoin, Tezos or Bancor created lots of buzz, but what happened to their tokens afterwards? Can investors get higher returns by buying tokens a few months after initial offerings?","The five largest ICOs from the top twenty by the amount raised show that returns on investment can reach up to 870 percent within three to four months. Please note that projects whose tokens are not tradable or traded for less than two months were not included in the review. The data was collected and processed within an ICORating agency research.Returns since ICO (USD): +1,138%Progress: Tezos may have been one of the most promising ICOs of 2017, as its technology was intended to simplify launches for new projects and to compete with Ethereum. Though the project’s roadmap contains no exact deadlines, and its founder Arthur Breitman posted the last tech update on Dec. 22, it seems that the platform would not be launched anytime soon.Moreover, Tezos has recently been filed with two lawsuits and accused of violating both US federal and state law. Its tokens were qualified as securities and, by not registering them as such, the company violated the Security Act. The project was also accused of fraud as tokens were distributed under the pretense of charitable contributions. Some of the investors have asked for refunds, but their claims were refused, which was explained by the fact that this was not presupposed by the initial agreement. Despite these issues, the price of Tezos tokens has never dropped below the ICO price and has shown a 12.4x return in US dollars since the ICO.Returns since ICO (USD): +108%Bancor aims to introduce an easy way to issue smart-tokens and convert them with no counterparty. The project has made progress since Launch Festival 2017 when its app was only in test-mode. Now it can convert 14 cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and BTN token, but the token-issuing option is not available yet. Bancor token demonstrates the lowest returns for ICOs among the reviewed.Returns since ICO (USD): +1,521%Progress: Status combines a mobile messenger and a browser to connect smartphone users with the Ethereum ecosystem. The founders stated that the beta-version was scheduled for Q2–Q3 2017 and that it would provide end-users with features such as encrypted messaging, a P2P exchange, an Ether wallet, etc.The release seems to be delayed, though that doesn’t mean there is no progress. From weekly public reports posted by Status team leaders, it seems that sooner or later the project would be finished. Nevertheless, this couldn’t guarantee success with users.Besides, the SNT token price is not growing exponentially, as no product uses their utility token to date. At the same time, there is no reason for a huge drop as the project is following its roadmap. All in all, the SNT token has multiplied its price by 16.2 since the ICO.Returns since ICO (USD): +1,023%Progress: Kin IСO was rated as low risky and its hype level seems high. The Kin ecosystem seems to be another promising approach to so-called “conversational commerce,” which is still only a concept for almost every messenger except WeChat.For the ICO market though Kin might  be one of the most viable projects as it has a tangible product and 300 mln active users per month. It is still a question how the average Kik user will liquidate their Kin. Also, there is no news about Kin’s integration with Kik which was scheduled for last quarter of 2017.Kin’s plan to move from Ethereum also doesn’t seem to be straightforward as it was faced with investor complaints. Despite Kik’s advantages over the very similar Status platform, Kin tokens demonstrate one and a half the return, which is about +1,023 percent since the ICO.Returns since ICO (USD): +550%Progress: TenX claimed to simplify the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life. The project has already launched its app. Its Android version has been downloaded over 50,000 times since August despite being in beta mode. The app is still in development and its expansion is planned for the beginning of 2018. After exponential growth, the price of the PAY token dropped from $5.33 to less than $1.5, but overall it has added 550 percent in value since the ICO.PAY token was also included in William Mougayar High Growth Cryptoassets Index, which is comprised of a strategic selection of undervalued crypto-assets.In 2017 the most successful projects by ICO were those, which promised to make Blockchain and cryptocurrencies more suitable for common use: exchanges, deposits, payments, token issuing, rewards, etc. But that does not mean the project’s focus guarantees ICO and post-ICO success.Generally, it is much more important for projects to have viable documentation and business goals, to follow the product roadmap and to inform investors about the progress on a regular basis.At the moment the two major problems of the post-ICO market might be overestimation and transparency. For investors and funds, it is crucial to have relevant project evaluation both before and after ICO. Unfortunately, it is not always obvious for founders, -- some of them go off media or rating radars after the successful initial offering and make projects susceptible to informational attacks.Another reason is that founders could overestimate their project and deadlines to create more buzz before ICO. Thus the implementation is delayed, and investors are constrained to sell tokens.These reasons, as well as other circumstances, could make token price drop down. Anyway, $6 bln was invested in tokens last year, so that the  post-ICO rating would matter a lot in 2018.  Brian Kean, CBDO at ICORating agency."

VPN service, or digitized money in solutions like Bitcoin or Ethereum.","Jan 10, 2018","In the golden era of advertising, finding an audience was as easy as publishing an ad in a widely circulated newspaper, running a radio or TV spot, or putting up billboards in relevant areas. With the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of new media types, however, casting such a broad net is the least efficient way of attracting customers. As attention spans are lowered in proportion to the number of competing ads in our periphery, advertisers must focus their messaging on specific audiences more than ever before.","For small businesses, targeting is especially crucial. Ads must be sharpened on several levels by demographic, geographic location, channels used and more. The goal is not just to get foot traffic into their store, but for it to be the right kind of traffic. To serve these businesses, location-based advertising (LBA) has emerged. Location-based advertising helps local brick and mortar shops by combining mobile advertising with geo-targeting technology. The success of this new brand of advertising justifies the rate at which the LBA industry is growing. Almost $30 billion is expected to pour into the industry by 2020, a 24.6% annual growth rate from 2015’s $9.8 billion according to BIA Kelsey.However, despite the efficacy of this marketing niche, it still faces many challenges. People have admitted their privacy concerns with GPS-based ad targeting and demonstrate that they are hesitant to opt in. Additionally, some of the promotional services that have entrenched themselves in the LBA sector make bringing in customers from online a frustratingly inefficient process. Blockchain is already disrupting this status quo, however, and threatens to tear down the barriers that are already in place in this young industry.Merchants and retailers in a specific location must take advantage of granular targeting tools. This will prevent them from wasting precious ad dollars on those with no chance of becoming a customer. More important than reach, however, is how adeptly a local business can create an online community to support its offline operations.Determining the target audience’s demography and adjusting the content of their messaging is important for this endeavor. So also is creating enticing promotions that incentivize customers to walk through the front door. For this, most businesses choose a location-based promotional platform like Groupon.The interactions that platforms like Groupon encourage between businesses and customers are shallow and unproductive. Locals will be targeted for the coupon deals in their area, and can buy them instantly. This system reveals two key problems: customers don’t need to provide any additional value other than their money, and they’re only encouraged to go to the restaurant or store if they can get a discount. The coupons themselves are restricted to certain times of day and to specific products or menu items as well. For businesses, arduous work must be done to optimize these discounts so that money isn’t lost when customers redeem them.Other companies such as FourSquare provide companies and consumers with a distorted view of the market. Companies must pay for user data that is curated by marketers, and don’t have real data on how effectively their dollars were spent. Users, on the other hand, must wade through hundreds of posts attempting to discern if what they are being shown locally is a real user opinion, or a sponsored post that was boosted higher artificially. This way, there is no real incentive to trust the system, or actively participate in it.Where the status quo fails at creating motivation to be loyal, long-term customers, Blockchain steps in. New LBA platforms built on the technology offer local businesses a way to nurture online communities where value continually cycles between themselves and their most loyal online advocates.A decentralized ledger technology, Blockchain is like a software platform that runs on a network of its own participants instead of a central server. Its unique infrastructure naturally addresses the security drawbacks in centralized content hosting and makes storing information and value on the network safer than ever. Blockchains usually use cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange for whatever is being transferred between the network’s users, like space on a cloud storage platform, bandwidth on a decentralized VPN service, or digitized money in solutions like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Middlemen have no place on Blockchain as there are no gates between users and content providers where fees or tolls can be installed.Cryptocurrency acts as a type of monetary reward, but can be customized to incentivize stakeholders only for the activities that benefit others in the ecosystem. Location-based advertising is a pertinent application for this technology because it can better align the interests of those being targeted and those doing the targeting, nurturing a mutually beneficial connection between them. Innovative companies are pursuing this concept with enthusiasm.By tokenizing their services, businesses reward people in their local area who complete tasks that inherently create value, like posting on social media, writing a brief review and so forth. LBA platform tokens can be spent at these retailers like cash, with more freedom than a mere coupon. Those consumers who work hard to contribute, participate and spend their tokens frequently are tracked by the immutable ledger and given a score which allows them to borrow more tokens to use in their favorite stores.Such a self-sustaining system recycles value in an airtight manner, meaning merchants don’t have to breakeven to win loyal business, and can get tangible advertising results in exchange for a small discount.Most vitally, however, Blockchain can offer merchants access to irrefutable data that can optimize their efforts. Because of the way the technology is built - with transactions being recorded in an immutable and open ledger - user data remains protected. It also offers businesses the ability to fully trust their results as there is no middleman or filter distorting the view. This gives merchants the ability to better fine tune their promotions, and offer more relevant deals to customers based on transparent data.Tokenizing services helps to drive transparency in location-based advertising, providing better reach for local businesses and offering customers a better deal in exchange. Mobile devices have the capability to be a portal to the best local experiences, but not when middlemen set up toll booths on either side. Thankfully, Blockchain is helping to build an express lane where local customers can quickly find the local establishments most enthusiastically chasing after their business."

I’m actually in Europe right now. Thanks for the reach out.”Ari Paul, the CIO at digital currency hedge fund BlockTower Capital, denied the legitimacy of any deal on Twitter, citing his own source at Circle and calling the Modern Consensus article “fake news”:I just posted a link to an article asserting that Circle was acquiring Poloniex. Someone helpfully replied that the article was fake news. I confirmed with Circle that the article is not correct. Circle is not acquiring Polo (according to my circle source.)Modern Consensus is a blog founded by Ken Kurson, former editor-in-chief at the New York Observer, that covers technology news in the cryptocurrency and Blockchain spheres.Another twitter user responded to Paul casting doubt on his alleged Circle source, given that Kurson put his reputation at stake in publishing the news:Do you think there is any possibility that your source at Circle is wrong or intentionally denying? Asking because the post on modern consensus is by Ken Kurson, who appears to be someone who would care for their reputation.Kurson cited one of the sources, who he referred to as “highly placed”, with apparent access to the acquisition discussions as saying:“Circle and Poloniex agreed to terms and Circle has already approached the regulators. The regulators came back with a list of KYC demands [Know Your Customer] and Circle has agreed to meet all the conditions.”Both Circle and Poloniex did not respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comments on the pending deal by press time.Circle, which received $50 mln from Goldman Sachs in a funding round in 2015, contains Circle Pay for fiat transfers, Circle Trade as a liquidity provider of cryptocurrencies, and soon will add Circle Invest, an app allowing retail customers to invest in crypto markets.Poloniex is currently the 14th largest crypto exchange by 24-hour volume on CoinMarketCap, trading a total of almost $300 million on the day to press time. The exchange allows users to trade in 68 different coins, a huge number as compared to Coinbase's popular crypto exchange platform GDAX, which offers only four, but is in 7th place by trading volume. The Poloniex exchange faced problems this year with incorrect user balances and a very slow withdrawal waiting period."

The controversial app aims to allow kids to ‘safely’ message and video chat with friends and loved ones. By allowing parents to control the Facebook account, they can monitor their children’s IM activity.","Underlying the parent discord is the sentiment that instant messenger users do not feel as if they have control over their data and privacy on chat apps.  Many parents, themselves, face illicit activity on their Facebook accounts. The average user confronts all sorts of malware, from adware to phishing schemes,  trying to take over instant messaging. Opening another virtual door to the household’s online life and handing children the keys is anathema to most parents.The Internet of Things introduces another growing security risk as household appliances, entertainment systems, energy systems and controls link up digitally connected life. Business data from the office and factory is also interconnected with mobile devices. Cybersecurity is key to ensuring this interconnected world functions safely and efficiently. Encryption solutions, however, have failed to lock out the hackers, phishers and spammers—the so-called man-in-the-middle (MITM).A new proprietary encryption identification system called Crypviser prevents the MITM from accessing, stealing or manipulating data across personal and business communication systems. 1.2 bln active users use Facebook Messenger monthly, making it a key target of hacking schemes. Sell data is another major privacy concern. WhatsApp is under investigation in France for providing user data to Facebook without users’ permission. The popular IM, whose content is said to be openly accessible by US intelligence agencies has over a billion users.Data is exchanged through public keys directly between the parties, allowing instant chat, audio, video, documents, photos and conferences to be safely exchanged without being intercepted by third parties.The IM communications and payments app allows users to circumvent the centralized systems of messengers such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Viber. Instead, parties communicate directly over a public network on the Blockchain. The platform uses patent-pending Blockchain authentication and verification system to prevent MITM attacks. If a third-party does enter the system, an intelligent intrusion detection system ensures detection and protection. The decentralized system further protects data by storing it on the device rather than on a messenger service’s centralized server. Crypviser can securely run on multiple devices. Any attempt to hack, steal or tamper with data would require changes to all transactions stored on individual computers on the transparent Blockchain.Crypviser provides a complete communications and data storage solution to allow users to operate within the secure CV ecosystem. CV offers a full communications suite for the private community user, secure business and large corporation. Standard communication suite services start with instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. These packages include the CV proprietary authentication system and encrypted local storage. The CVPay payments system and an electronic wallet are also included, allowing store and transfer CVCoin between Crypviser users.IOS and Android apps are currently in beta testing mode. The Crypviser messenger will officially be in operation in early 2018. The free app allows users to verify the security codes for chats and calls individually, whereas a paid app fully automates the encryption process, providing the highest level of security. The app can be purchased and chats verified using the CVCoin available on cryptocurrency exchanges (currently at www.openledger.io).Marlene Elliot, Guest AuthorDisclaimer.

Director of ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab, Dragan Boscovic, commented:“ASU welcomes this initiative and is ready to play its role in creating a potent Blockchain research and innovation environment for young talents to develop practical Blockchain applications.”When thinking about digital currencies, there’s a tendency for the community to focus on the development side of the equation. New versions of the software, updates to add new features, roadmaps and the like - these usually get far more attention than research. However, the new features that get everybody so excited are made possible by researchers who discover the means and methods to add them.While Dash’s Core DAO (distributed autonomous organization) is focused on development, marketing and the day-to-day aspects of maintaining a digital currency, there are at least two research groups working to move the project forward. Dash Labs is a DAO founded by Dash founder Evan Duffield, based in Hong Kong, that is working to develop hardware solutions to enable on-chain scaling using massive blocks.Likewise, researchers at ASU are working on researching ways to improve Dash and solve the problems of cryptocurrency in general. Last summer, Dash funded ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab with a $50,000 donation. Dash Core Team CEO Ryan Taylor wrote:“Initial research [will] focus on throughput capacity and latency performance of blockchain technology, model and assess it for different network architectures (including Dash's multi-tiered architecture), applications, and use cases to propose a ""scalability"" deployment guide and best practices.”Taylor notes that the partnership is exclusive:“Until now, the majority of Blockchain research has been focused on Bitcoin, with minimal focus on other Blockchain applications…The sponsorship incorporate[s] Dash as the exclusive digital currency for ongoing academic research.”Dash isn’t the only digital currency project to partner with a major university. In the summer of 2015, MIT launched the Digital Currency Initiative and solicited donations which were used to hire three full-time Bitcoin developers. This move followed the effective collapse of the Bitcoin Foundation, which had been providing much of the funding for development. None of the funds actually come from MIT, rather, they come from outside donors and are funneled through the Digital Currency Initiative.By May 2016, MIT had raised $900,000 to fund these developers’ salaries. Later that year, this number had risen to $2 million. This funding is crucial, as Nasdaq points out:“Funding Bitcoin development seems to have always been problematic.”While some developers are willing and able to work full-time on open source projects like Bitcoin without compensation, most are not. Therefore, funding is desperately needed to maintain and advance the project.While MIT has serious fundraising muscle, dependence on the altruism of others is always a shaky proposition. While most digital currency projects rely on donations or an initial endowment (via ICO) to fund development, Dash has chosen a different method. Dash self-funds its development team, paying developer salaries out of a portion of the block rewards.Each month, 10% of the block rewards are reserved for successful treasury proposals. This means that as much as 6,650 DASH, worth $5.8 mln at press time, can be paid out directly by the network to those who manage to get their treasury proposals passed. Dash’s treasury system pays for marketing efforts, business development and integrations, conference sponsorships and more.Most important, Dash’s treasury pays Dash Core developers’ salary each month. At present, Dash employs a staff of 50, including 23 developers, four project managers, eight marketing specialists and 15 other administrative employees. These team members are paid a total of $300,000 per month, directly from Dash’s treasury system. No donations are necessary, and nobody is required to work for free.It’s this treasury system that funded the $350,000 partnership with ASU.One of Dash’s community members who goes by the handle of “TanteStefana,” wrote that while MIT funds Bitcoin’s development, Dash funds ASU’s research lab. She points out that the direction of influence is completely different: Bitcoin is at least partially dependent on the good will and fundraising efforts of MIT. This means the university could theoretically attempt to influence the project.With the partnership between Dash and ASU, money and influence flows in the opposite direction. It’s Dash that’s providing funding to ASU, making it impossible for the university to wield any influence over the project.Cointelegraph had the opportunity to speak with Dragan Boscovic, director of ASU’s Blockchain Research Lab, who commented on why Dash is such a good fit for the university:“First, the Dash Core team’s offices are at ASU’s SkySong Innovation Center in Scottsdale, which is also where the Blockchain Research is located, enabling an excellent level of interaction between Dash, ASU faculty and students in a variety of disciplines, including computer science, engineering, business and law. Second, ASU is focused on “building problem solvers and entrepreneurs,” with a large Research and Development budget. Dash is one of the most innovative digital currency solutions with breakthrough algorithms, network topology and services. It’s a natural partnership. Third, there’s been quite a demand for an online graduate course focused on Blockchain technology enablers and applications. The course will help ensure that Blockchain finds an accelerated path toward rapid, mainstream adoption.”When asked what set Dash apart from other digital currency projects, Boscovic replied:“After partnering with Dash this summer and evaluating the possibilities of expanded collaboration, scholarships, Blockchain specialization courses and an accelerated research and innovation effort were identified as ways to move Blockchain applications forward. This speaks volumes about Dash network governance and their capability to self-fund strategic initiatives such as this one.”"

The president has already set aside 5 mln barrels of Venezuelan oil in preparation, with the currency set to launch in 6 weeks in the form of an auction, as it will be pre-mined.However, on Jan. 9, the Venezuelan parliament declared the Petro an illegal currency. The parliament has stood in opposition to President Maduro since his Socialist Party lost its majority in 2016, and has been vocal against what they see as a fraudulent currency.Parliament Deputy Williams Dávila said, according to newspaper El Universal, that the Petro’s creations only serves to:“Evade financial sanctions, [and is] openly violating the Constitution, and legitimizing illicit transactions.”Venezuela, a country facing both hyperinflation and EU and US sanctions, has seen a massive amount of Bitcoin use among its population, which is choosing to use digital currency over the failing government-issued Bolivar. Some see the high volume of Bitcoin use in Venezuela as the start of one of the first “Bitcoinizations” of a sovereign state.While the upcoming launch of the Petro is uncertain due its tenuous political context, the idea of using cryptocurrency for oil trading had come up before in 2016, when the strained relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia caused alarm over oil market stability."

As the source says, the number of such jobs is expected to grow in 2018 as well. Needless to mention, skillful developers are few now and in high demand. A new project titled Fabric Token intends to solve the problem of the lack of Blockchain specialists and current difficulties in decentralized application development by setting up a marketplace and launching the application for smart contract generation.","Blockchain technology is not without its own challenges. It is currently difficult for people and businesses to use Blockchain and develop decentralized applications due to lack of user-friendly interfaces, documentation, in-depth guides, the Fabric Token team states on its website. Another side of the problem is that it is extremely expensive to hire experts in the field because there are so few of them as of yet.The Fabric Token startup was founded in the fall of 2017, and it is still in its early stages now. Nevertheless, it is going to “empower individuals and businesses with easy access to Blockchain technology and smart contracts,” according to its white paper. The paper also specifies that The Fabric Token platform will consist of four main components – The Fabric Token, TokenGen, DApp Workbench and the Fabric Store.The project’s inner means of payment, which is appropriately called the Fabric Token, will be used as a utility to pay for products and services within the platform. For instance, if someone wants to take advantage of TokenGen and generate secure smart contracts for their own token and crowdsale, they will need to pay the small fee in Fabric Tokens in order to get access to their code.TokenGen is due to be released in February 2018, and it is supposed to allow people to easily generate smart contracts for the token economy by going through a simple and straightforward step-by-step process.The web application called DApp Workbench is probably the main product of the ecosystem. The tool will allow businesses of any size to easily integrate Blockchain technology and smart contracts into their business process management. The software will include a desktop application, which will feature a drag-and-drop UI, allowing users to graphically build their workflows using the BPMN standard. On the back-end, DApp Workbench will use smart contract components for specific use cases to cover businesses’ needs for operations. The product will also have a cloud, where smart contracts will be tested, compiled and monitored.The final component of the FT ecosystem is the Fabric Store, which will be a decentralized marketplace for smart contract components, similar to the Atlassian marketplace. The Fabric Store will allow third-party developers to contribute smart contract components to the platform, further expanding the functionality scope of the proprietary software.The Fabric Token team plans to launch its crowdsale on Feb. 15, 2018, at exactly 10 UTC. The total supply of the tokens will reach 100 mln. The fundraiser cap is 80 mln FT equaling roughly $9 mln. The ICO is going to close either 45 days after the launch or whenever the fundraiser cap is reached.Disclaimer. Cointelegraph does not endorse any content or product on this page.

Pay-to-Play Gaming Is Flawed, Blockchain-Based Platform Says.","Jan 22, 2018","Despite the fact that Facebook and LinkedIn are used by millions today, these social networks seem to miss a major trump card in future – they do not use Blockchain. Meanwhile, a startup called TraDove has become the premier B2B social network based on Blockchain.","“We make it fast, safe and easy for buyers and sellers around the world to connect,” says TraDove’s website. According to it, today over 250,000 corporate users from 100,000 companies are running platform from over 80 countries. Employees of Nestle, Tata Motors, Huawei, Toyota, Walmart, General Electrics, Boeing, Siemens, Ford, and other international giants have already joined the B2B network.TraDove is trying to challenge the way international trade companies are being connected today. TraDove CEO Kent Yan, an MIT graduate in engineering, believes that importing, exporting, purchasing and other regular trading procedures may be changed by the opportunities that Blockchain provides. The startup wants to bring transparency and authenticity to the B2B enterprise space.They are effectively creating an intelligent platform to connect business partners via a social network. Spanning both local and global markets, TraDove operates with a commitment to help corporate buyers and sellers make deals.According to Kent Yan, the TraDove was created as a reaction to frustration with international trade that Mr. Yan feels. The social B2B network was formed to authenticate, vet, and review buyers and sellers with the use of smart contracts to execute safe B2B global interactions.""As a result, I came up with this idea to create a business-oriented social network to connect corporate buyers, sellers and other partners together so they can find each other in clicks rather than weeks or months,"" Kent Yan said in the Q&A to the E27 news website.TraDove intends to use Ethereum-based smart contracts to build an intelligent platform for connecting business partners via a social network. By design, Blockchains are innately resistant to modification and are hashed to prevent cyberattacks. This is especially important for large enterprises.""B2B is not transparent, it’s very hard to validate and qualify a good buyer or supplier,” said Mr. Yan. “You can read what you find on the Internet, but there is not a central network where these buyers and suppliers can be rated and vetted,"" he added.TraDove’s cryptocurrency - BBCoin – is supposed to provide a better payment instrument for international trade. The coin should become the first B2B token in the market, that opens up corporate demand for cryptocurrency and boost companies’ sales, marketing and trading needs. BBCoin will also be used as a payment instrument for trusted B2B transaction, especially international trade.Using the cryptos, companies may eliminate local banking stress and enjoy ease and low cost of payment to send money in and out of countries. “We will let corporate sellers use our basic services for free and use BBCoin to pay for prioritized or value-added utilities, such as notifying sellers as to buyers' searched or expressed needs,” says the company’s website.TraDove has launched its crowdsale campaign with a presale, it’s hard cap is expected at over $5 mln.

This game changer compels people used to the conventional online banking ecosystem to check out the alternative Blockchain technology.To cater to the needs of the people and provide a solution to the existing neobanking system, the Hush project comes into play with a business model that is regulated, tokenized, participative and crypto-compatible to its European audience.Developed by a team with vast experience in the banking sector, including Eric Charpentier, founder of the Morning neobank in France, the Hush Blockchain-powered neobank will provide simplified services regarding usage and disposal of cryptocurrency money, including an IBAN for fiat currencies, and a wallet for cryptocurrencies.The core objective is to authorize crypto holders to store their coins in a secure wallet, and exchange them into Euros based on their personal needs. Users will have full control over configuration features when withdrawing or transferring funds, whether in fiat currency of cryptocurrency. The Hush wallet, which will also include USH tokens, can be used to exchange the tokens for Euros daily.To attain its mission, Hush intends to rely on its active user community to help co-build the next-generation neobank, suggesting features, participating in the development process and discussing interfaces. The end goal is to empower the community to adopt Blockchain technology and use it get control of their funds in cryptocurrency form.The new Hush platform will leverage USH tokens to enable users to uncover the perks of simplified crypto-money usage. The token will also act as a financial lever for the development of a complete community-based, mobile neobanking experience. Placed at the center of the user experience, the token will be the contributive and participative voice of the project, meant to be used to pay for Hush services (which brings a 50 percent reduction in commissions when paying with USH), receives loyalty rewards or take part in the Hush Ambassador program. Participating has its benefits from the three available reward formats: the first one includes hush badges, based on USH held and cumulative points. The second reward format offers USH tokens for participating in major activities, and the last one includes acquiring new badges.Following the launch of the ICO, the initial cryptocurrencies available will be Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether and Dash.

borders, peer-to-peer over the Internet, in a trusted and secure manner.","Jan 18, 2018","On Jan.10 the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of the “Big Four” accounting firms, from auditing India listed firms for two years for failing to spot $1.7 bln accounting fraud at IT services company Satyam Computer Services.","The Satyam accounting fraud scandal followed by its downfall broke on Jan. 7, 2009 when Satyam’s then chairman, Byrraju Ramalinga Raju admitted to fictitiously overstating the company’s cash balance by $1.7 bln or by 94 percent with the help of its auditor PwC. Due to this accounting scandal, Satyam’s shareholders lost as much as $2.2 bln as its stock value tanked.As the independent guarantor of Satyam’s financial information, PwC -- following in the footsteps of Arthur Andersen -- ignored the “glaring anomalies” in the financial details reported by Satyam, which inflated its revenue with 7,561 fake invoices.  Arthur Andersen was auditor of Enron Corp., whose shareholders lost $74 bln in the all-time worst US corporate accounting scandal in 2002. Arthur Andersen not only breached public’s trust by aiding in Enron’s accounting fraud but went a step further by obstructing justice as well.  Arthur Andersen’s accountants rolled up their sleeves and shredded tons of Enron’s fraudulent accounting/audit records as the company's billions in losses hidden in off-the-balance-sheet-offshore-entities came under US government scrutiny. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) shuttered Arthur Andersen on March 14, 2002, by charging it criminally.  This reduced the number of worlds big accounting firms from “Big Five” to “Big Four.”    As the sun set in India on Satyam and PwC due to their collective corrupt undertakings, in the land of the raising sun—Japan--a new triple-entry accounting ledger system made its world debut on Jan. 9, 2009.  A programmer (or group of programmers) using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto launched the groundbreaking Blockchain network and the first units of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, allowing people to send it, across borders, peer-to-peer over the Internet, in a trusted and secure manner.Nakamoto’s Blockchain technology was the first working example of a triple-entry accounting system, which was first proposed by Professor Yuir Ijiri, CPA in 1989, followed by cryptographer Ian Grigg in 2005. Defined as an open, distributed ledger--Blockchain technology records and verifies transactions without any trusted central authority. Blockchains are resistant to modification of data and cannot be altered retroactively. The technology greatly reduces the potential for errors when reconciling complex and disparate information from multiple sources.  Because every transaction is recorded and verified, the integrity of financial records is guaranteed, making the falsification or destruction of the records practically impossible.  Blockchain technology is designed to ultimately reduce fraud, as well as the need for auditing resources.India has not made accounting on Blockchain with its triple entry accounting system a mandate yet. Under the Companies Indian Accounting Standards Rules (Ind AS), 2015 G.S.R. 111(E) various classes of companies are required to use a double entry accounting system, that was  formulated in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392).While breaking from tradition is challenging, both industry and the Indian government at the federal and state level are pushing towards adopting Blockchain technology with its triple-entry  accounting system with great force to transform India’s economy—which is the seventh largest and the fastest growing in the world.The most striking example of the Blockchain technology transformation in India has been scandalous Satyam’s sale in 2012 to its rival Tech Mahindra that initiated multiple Blockchain initiatives during the last quarter of 2017. Australian energy trading company Power Ledger and Tech Mahindra are testing microgrids on Blockchain, new platform enables households and businesses to trade power from solar panels and battery storage, and it also facilitates the crowdfunding (ICO) of renewable energy assets. Tech Mahindra also announced that it is working on developing a solution using Blockchain technology for vehicle registration and related activities.On the federal government side, the State Bank of India with assets over $460 bln promised that it will implement Blockchain solutions in a number of financial processes including the management of its Know Your Customer (KYC) system.  “In the future, virtually every function in the world of Financial Services will be displaced, disintermediated and decentralized,” explained Ron Quaranta, Chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance, which has partnerships with Asia Pacific Countries, during an American Institute of Certified Public Accountants/CPA.com Executive Roundtable.On the state government side, Andhra Pradesh became the first state in the country to pilot Blockchain technology in two departments, land registry and transportation. This was followed by the state of Maharashtra announcing the use of the Blockchain-integrated platform to secure various government data, potentially including land ownership records as well.Currently, India is in the process of developing Blockchain and cryptocurrency legislation.In April 2017 the Indian government formed an Inter-Disciplinary Committee chaired by Special Secretary (Economic Affairs) to examine the existing legal framework with regard to cryptocurrencies to formulate appropriate regulations.In June 2017, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi announced a complete overhaul of India’s goods and services tax (GST) system.  But there is yet to be clarity on the application of international, federal and state level GST taxes on Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.   The Indian Supreme Court pushed the government -- central bank and other agencies --to respond to calls to regulate cryptocurrencies as soon as possible.In response, India's finance minister, Arun Jaitley, clarified that the government does not recognize cryptocurrency as legal tender.Selva Ozelli, Esq., CPA is an international tax attorney and CPA who frequently writes about tax, legal and accounting issues for TaxNotes, Bloomberg BNA, other publications and the OECD.Disclaimer.

TokenStars, a decentralized platform built on the Blockchain, aims to connect celebrities with fans and advertisers, and it already counts 15 stars onboard.","Supported by celebrity advisors such as world football champions Lothar Matthäus and Gianluca Zambrotta, Hollywood photographer Rico Torres and NHL top-scorer Nikita Kucherov, TokenStars targets a global celebrity management market topping $100+ bln. The startup aims to disrupt the monopoly of the top 10 talent management agencies controlling over $25 bln in contracts. Redfoo (LMFAO), a popular American DJ, hockey star Pavel Datsyuk and Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver are already using the first platform module to raise money via a Blockchain-based charity auction.Two dozens of celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Jamie Foxx and Floyd Mayweather, have already endorsed various projects on Blockchain or publicly invested in ICOs. However, most endorsements are merely ad contracts and do not represent the actual involvement in the $500+ bln crypto market.A celebrity management platform powered by the Blockchain could help stars connect with fans and advertisers directly without having to deal with agents who charge high fees. Built on Ethereum, TEAM by TokenStars aims to streamline the way brands, fans and celebrities interact with each other, whether it’s an endorsement contract, fan competition or a merchandise shopping.The end goal is different for all community members. An aspiring celebrity gets upfront funds to drive a career from their avid fans or via hard-to-get advertising contracts. An already established star can find new revenue streams by selling merchandise or exclusive communication options to fans, start a contest or a charity initiative or find new sponsors.In return, the celebrity pays TokenStars a commission from the sponsorship deals and prize money. Commission is paid in tokens, which are bought on exchanges. The growth of token value is a strong incentive for token holders. Additionally, token holders are awarded for scouting and voting for the rising stars. As a result, TokenStars aims to become a one-stop-shop for celebrity management actions.The TEAM platform is live, and it integrates 12 major modules divided into four layers by function. Blockchain technology ensures that a platform can provide transparency and scalability as well as successfully compete with today’s highly lucrative celebrity management industry.The first layer, crowdfunding, is already live. It includes the modules targeted at celebrities eager to raise funds from supportive fans, to get advertising contracts or to support charity initiatives, as well as at fans that want to become part of the TEAM ecosystem.To showcase its platform in action, TokenStars has already arranged two brand contracts. The Contests and Charity module launched in December 2017, is currently powering the Charity Crypto Auction, where celebrities donate some of their personal items, all of them being sold at the auction. Memorabilia items from Redfoo (ex-LMFAO), crypto-star Roger Ver, and biathlon Olympic champion Tarjei Boe are just some of the items being sold.“One of my favorite things about cryptocurrencies is that they can really make a change in the world. Whether it’s business, arts, sports or now non-profits, they attract the attention of people all over the world to the things that matter. That’s the reason I’m happy to support Crypto Charity Auction by TokenStars,” says Roger Ver, a Bitcoin evangelist and early investor.Bidding on Ver’s signed T-shirt helps to raise money for Mises Institute which promotes teaching and research in the Austrian School of Economics, and individual freedom, honest history and international peace. Another lot, a T-shirt from Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis, is already gone for a whopping $987– a 20x from the actual price. Two more modules of TokenStars platform will be out in Q1 2018.TEAM by TokenStars is the utility token used in activities on the TokenStars platform. It includes agency commission repayments from advertisers and celebrities, offering exclusive incentives to fans, and rewarding users for scouting rising stars.To ensure all activities performed on the platform are verifiable, TokenStars leverages the perks of Blockchain technology. The decentralized model ensures low money transfer costs and fast transactions, empowering the global community to participate without involving third parties.After successfully raising $4.9+ mln in the ACE token sale for tennis, TokenStars switches to TEAM- a decentralized Blockchain-based platform that combines sports and showbiz into an ecosystem that brings world-known celebrities, fans and advertisers under the same roof.An impressive lineup of over 15 international celebrities in entertainment and sports, including FIFA World Cup champions and NHL stars, already support the project. The TokenStars TEAM advisory board has renowned names in several industries, like football (Lothar Matthäus, Gianluca Zambrotta), tennis (Tommy Haas, Cedric Pioline, Robin Soderling), hockey (Nikita Kucherov), Hollywood (Rico Torres), poker (Alexander Anter), and more.The TokenStars TEAM presale started on Dec. 20 and it will last until Jan. 27.

PolySwarm’s CEO, Steve Bassi, previously founded Narf Industries, an information security R&D firm that won a grant from the Department of Homeland Security to implement Blockchain on identity management. Steve and his team also consulted for DARPA and Fortune 100 companies. Mark Tonnesen, former McAfee CIO, recently joined on the advisory team, says the PolySwarm’s website.According to the Cybersecurity Ventures recent report, cybersecurity related costs are expected to double by  2021. The report predicts that cybercrime damages will cost the world $6 tln annually in just three years.Cyberattacks are considered to be the fastest growing crime in the US, and they are increasing in size and frequency. There are 400 new threats every minute, and up to 70 percent of emerging attacks going undetected by signature-based antivirus.These shortcomings are caused by today’s market incentives. According to the PolySwarm’s brief, the $8.5 bln industry is dominated by few very large companies, that try to solve for common “known” malware, but fail to detect new threats. A market of single-vendor solutions rewards duplication of effort across vendors, discourages investment in specialized detection capabilities and encourages vendor lock-in via mutually incompatible software packages.Another problem, according to PolySwarm, is that today’s market incentivizes overlapping coverage among competing products, duplication of cost and effort for all parties. To fulfill its mission effectively, Swarm is looking to enlist enterprise IT teams and antivirus software companies that spot new files, new software, new documents that need to be scanned, to farm out those scans to a distributed network of researchers. It allows security experts to monetize their software, and enterprises to obtain more complete threat coverage.Unlike other bug bounties, threat detection is automated, there is no human in the loop, which allows for higher speed and enables scale. These experts get paid in Nectar (NCT) tokens based on the accuracy and speed of their engines: the market rewards experts who are best able to defend enterprises and end users.The marketplace uses Ethereum smart contracts and the Blockchain to bring enterprises, consumers, vendors and security experts together into a single marketplace for more complete cyber threat detection.On Jan. 8, 2018 PolySwarm officially announced its plans to launch an ICO. The sale will start on Feb. 6. PolySwarm's token Nectar will have a finite supply, 70 percent of which will be sold during the ICO, the token won’t be minable.  The start has an ambitious $50 mln funding goal. 70 percent of the tokens will be sold during the token sale. The company will keep 15 percent of the tokens, while the other 15 percent will be used to grow the network, including strategic allocations to potential security industry partners.  The PolySwarm’s core team have shown transparency around the project, making GitHub Code available, planning to launch and MVP prior to the crowdsale and actively answering technical questions on PolySwarms’s Telegram group.Disclaimer.

major hurdles facing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.","Jan 17, 2018","The global cryptocurrency community has been abuzz with speculation in the wake of a leaked white paper linked to the popular, encryption-based messaging app Telegram.","News of Telegram’s plans to launch a Blockchain platform originally broke in December, although it still remains unclear if the project legitimately exists.  Cointelegraph has reviewed the leaked white paper, which lays out ongoing plans to launch Blockchain services and its very own cryptocurrency using Telegram as a springboard.While the legitimacy of the white paper and its actual association with Telegram has not been confirmed by the Durov brothers, who founded Telegram, the white paper promises some interesting applications to users of the messaging app and wider audiences.With access to 200 mln Telegram users, the developers of the project hope to reach a massive audience with what they are calling the Telegram Open Network (TON).TON is being touted as a scalable multi-Blockchain architecture using a proof-of-stake protocol to address what the white paper describes as major hurdles facing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.The white paper cites a lack of capacity to manage high volumes of transactions, unfriendly user applications and a limited market to use cryptocurrencies for goods, content and services as stumbling blocks TON will address.By using Telegram’s massive user base, the developers hope to reach the critical mass required for mass adoption if its services.According to the white paper, the TON Blockchain is “a scalable and flexible Blockchain architecture that consists of a master chain and up to 292 accompanying Blockchains.”The various protocols chosen promise to be able to process millions of transactions per second.This will be facilitated by the use of an infinite ‘sharding’ paradigm which will allow the Blockchain to split and merge in response to different network loads. Instant hypercube routing will supposedly manage transaction across different Blockchains. Along with a proof-of-stake protocol, the use of 2-D distributed ledgers is said to allow TON to build “new valid blocks on top of any blocks that were proven to be incorrect to avoid unnecessary forks.”Once their Blockchain is up and running, TON will launch a number of services with the Blockchain. This will include a data storage service, a virtual private network service, a DNS as well as its very own payment system.The payment system will use TON’s very own cryptocurrency, called Grams.Users will be able to use Grams to pay for content and services that will be provided by Telegram and other decentralized services.Of course, to make all of this a reality, TON will launch a token sale sometime in the first quarter of 2018. There will a total supply of five bln Grams, of which 200 mln (four percent) will be held by the development team in a four-year vesting period.In what is described as a bid to prevent speculative trading, 52 percent of the overall supply will be held in the TON reserve during the initial development and launch. The other 44 percent will be sold using a formula ensuring a steadily rising price per token.Now that we’ve got through the nitty gritty of the proposed TON ICO, we can discuss the legitimacy of the project and its purported link to Telegram, its founders and developers.Both Nikolai and Pavel Durov, as well as a number of Telegram’s senior developers, are listed in the white paper. However, there has been no official comment from either of the Durov brothers.Nevertheless, there seems to be mixed sentiment on social media.Some users are excited by the promise of a mix of decentralized, encrypted data services linked to TON.You can already find in the internet leaked Telegram ICO white paper, but the most excited part for me that there are TON Storage(aka decentralized Dropbox), TON DNS(friendly account names), TON Proxy(anonymizer) #Telegram #TON #TelegramICOAnother user expressed concerns at the initial holding structure of Grams by the development team:@durov Does your team have any clue of how POS works? I'm sure your ICO will do very well, but to be quiet honest in your white paper proposal you're already a threat to ""Ton"". Coins/Tokens in POS are not to be distributed like a company and holding 52%. What in the world pic.twitter.com/YdgE96fcjpConversations with a couple of Blockchain and cryptocurrency experts bring to light a number of points to consider.The best way to describe this white paper is ‘fun fiction,’ according to ICObench.com advisor Vasily Sumanov.With a massive user base, it’s not hard to see why fans of Telegram would want to see it metamorphosize into something far greater. A state free community with its very own cryptocurrency and linked services - a crypto-utopia of sorts.If this piece of work really is fun fiction, the authors have produced a compelling white paper that promises many things. The sharding technology may not be available in current projects, but it's also not clear if there is a need for a Blockchain that can store that much information. How much space would a node need to store a Blockchain that has 292side chains?The writers have also used good-practice mechanisms in the restriction of available tokens during the initial stage of development, which would chase away speculative investors in favor of long-term capitalists that see real value in the technology.If this ‘leaked’ white paper has done anything, it has shown that there is great interest in an ICO that is linked to established applications that provide crucial real-world solutions.Telegram and its creators will no doubt have appreciated the attention, but whether they are actually busy concocting their own legitimate ICO based on Blockchain technology remains to be seen.Sumanov, who also doubles up as an academic researcher, believes the Durov brothers would not leave anything to conjecture, with a guns-blazing announcement if they were truly launching an ICO.“Really, it is too simple and too ‘good.’ I think, that if Durov plans to make an ICO, he will make a public announcement with a really original white paper. Taking into account that Mr. Durov is a libertarian, I believe he will somehow make the integration of his own cryptocurrency and services into Telegram. Will be this done using an ICO or not? Only time will tell,” Sumanov told Cointelegraph.Conversely, ICOBox founder Mike Raitsyn is far more optimistic about the authenticity of the white paper. Given that the Durov brothers have previously spoken about the possibility of an ICO, Raitsyn says the documents look legitimate.Furthermore, he insists that the success of Telegram and the network it has built could be the catalyst for a truly universal cryptocurrency.“Despite their revolutionary potential, existing cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum lack the qualities required to attract the mass consumer. The current state of Blockchain technology is very promising, but it is obvious that the market is experiencing an acute need in a mainstream user-friendly cryptocurrency that would attract mass users and employ the full potential of the new technology,” Raitsyn said.The technology that will power TON is also a first according to Raitsyn, providing unique features like sharding technology which promises to increased speed and scalability to its Blockchain to support a massive user base.The expert isn’t concerned about the grand scale of the project, saying the broad scale of offerings is a natural progression of Blockchain technology.“TON will be a third generation Blockchain project which would offer vastly superior capabilities to users. TON has been designed as a multi-Blockchain platform, which would meet the growing demand for a platform offering a broad range of services. It will provide speed and scalability, intuitive user interfaces and an engaged use base to exchange value.”If Raitsyn is correct, the Durov brothers will make announcements later this year to either confirm or deny the legitimacy of this project.Polynom Crypto Capital founder Alexey Ivanov told Cointelegraph that the most crucial part of TON’s plans is the massive Telegram user base. If they make good on their promises, only social media giants could rival them.“They have almost a 200 mln audience to reach and give them the payment platform. They can only be outdone by Facebook or Google,” Ivanov said.Meanwhile, adverts promoting the presale of Gram tokens have been seen on Facebook.On Tuesday, Jan. 16 Pavel Durov sent out a tweet warning people of potential scams around the TON ICO.This is scam. Be careful.However neither one of the Durov brothers have come out with a public statement regarding the TON ICO."

HT can be used in various ways, of which, the most basic use of HT is for the discount on trading fees, of up to 50 percent.Huobi Token (HT) is not an initial coin offering (ICO). Users can only get HT by purchasing ‘Point Card’ on Huobi Pro. Point Card is Huobi’s pre-paid card for basic service charge-trading fees. 1 point = 1 USDT. For example, if you purchase the 1,000 Point Card package, is will only cost USDT 990, and you will get 1,000 HT for free. Points can be used for offsetting the trading fees.Huobi Global will only be distributing and strictly limiting to a fixed total of 500-million HT, never to be increased.Huobi Tokens (HT) can be exchanged to USDT, BTC and ETH in Huobi Pro.Each quarter, Huobi Pro will use 20% of its income to buyback the Huobi Tokens in the open market. All the HT that were bought back will be allocated to Huobi Investor Protection Fund (HIPF) in a certain proportion. The HIPF is used to protect investors’ benefits and compensate for the losses by Huobi users when risks occur in the platform, to ensure market stability and protect the interests of investors.For example if the quarterly profits of Huobi Pro is US$100-million, Huobi Pro will be using $20-million to buyback HT consecutively over a period of time.With the HT you can buy different grades of VIP membership, which provides you trading different fee discount percentage accordingly, up to 50%.In the future, HT will be available for usage on Huobi Global Platforms such as Huobi Japan, Huobi Korea, and Huobi Wallet.Huobi Pro has released an announcement for HT, you can find more information here.Subordinate to Huobi Global, Huobi.Pro is a secure digital asset exchange serving global traders.

In their report, the researcher comments:“It’s not clear if we’re looking at an early test of an attack, or part of a ‘legitimate’ mining operation where the owners of the hardware are aware of the mining. On the one hand the sample contains obvious messages printed for debugging that an attacker would avoid. But it also contains fake filenames that appear to be an attempt to avoid detection of the installed mining software.”Noting the “unusually open” nature of the alleged host university, it could even be that the author is not North Korean, or that the recipient is in fact not what it seems.The AlienVault report breaks down the possible scenarios, given the data at hand:“The hostname barjuok.ryongnamsan.edu.kp address doesn’t currently resolve. That means the software can’t send mined currency to the authors - on most networks. It may be that:AlienVault also notes that if the North Korean government is in fact behind the operation, it may be part of a move to use cryptocurrency to “provide a financial lifeline” in light of sanctions against the country.In late December, the CEO of Crowdstrike, a US cybersecurity company, told reporters that he was certain the North Korean government was stealing and stockpiling cryptocurrency.The new malware’s appearance marks the latest phase in the cyberwarfare afflicting the two Koreas. Last month, North Korean state-funded hackers were reportedly heavily involved in cryptocurrency theft targeting the South Korea’s exchanges.In an experimental ‘white hat hack’ in late December, a Seoul-based media outlet used security experts to successfully compromise accounts it created on five major South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, highlighting the ease with which malicious parties could steal funds."

The Strange Case of CCN and the Google June 2019 Core Update.","Jan 18, 2018","The Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB) has announced that the government’s long-discussed idea for a state-issued cryptocurrency, referred to as the CryptoRuble, will be launched in the middle of 2019.","The Russian government has been going back and forth on launching the CryptoRuble (known earlier as the Bitruble) since 2015. As recently as late December, 2017 during a meeting on legislation for digital currencies, the Deputy Minister of Finance and the first Deputy Governor of Russia's Central Bank both stated that they did not think it was necessary for the state to issue its own cryptocurrency.According to Arseniy Sheltsin, the head of RACIB, details of the CryptoRuble project will be officially presented and discussed in July 2018, and the coin itself should be issued a year later. The Government and the Central Bank of Russia are also expected to prepare regulatory measures for Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency mining by July 2018.Early in 2018, one of President Putin’s counselors noted that the CryptoRuble could help the Russian government strengthen the economy by avoiding the impact of international sanctions against the country.According to Russian crypto journal Forklog, the coin is set to be pegged to the ruble, non-mineable, and will be the only legal cryptocurrency in the country. The government hopes the CryptoRuble will attract foreign cryptocurrency investments.Overall, the highest leaders in the Russian government have held mixed to negative opinions towards cryptocurrencies. At a state press conference on January 12, Putin stated:“It is known that there is nothing behind the cryptocurrency, and it cannot be a store of value, it doesn’t have any material value, and it’s not backed by anything...”Russia’s Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, also recently criticized cryptocurrencies at the Gaidar’s Forum in Moscow. He compared the virtual currency trend with the dotcom bubble and suggested that most cryptocurrencies are likely to cease to exist, while Blockchain technology will remain, declaring:“We can not completely exclude the scenario that took place at the beginning of the 90s when many companies arose on the basis of the developing Internet technology and in the beginning of the 2000s those companies mostly disappeared from the scene.  Nonetheless, the technology itself not only survived but currently plays an important role in our life. In a likely manner cryptocurrencies may disappear in several years, but the technology which stands behind them, I mean blockchain, will become a part of our everyday reality. This scenario cannot be denied,”In response to the Russian government’s recent critique of cryptocurrencies the CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board of the largest Russian bank Sberbank Herman Gref called on the authorities to not ban virtual currencies. Gref considers both cryptocurrencies and Blockchain to be the “new huge technologies whose power cannot be realized at the moment.” He also declared “in no circumstances should [cryptocurrency] be banned”.Several other countries have also announced plans to introduce their own state-issued cryptocurrencies, such as Venezuela and Senegal."

News. Bitcoin Dominance Growing — What It Could Mean for Altcoins.","Jan 13, 2018","Communication flow and logistics is an essential aspect of human existence which forms the backbone of the transfer of goods, services and value.","As international trade and logistics continues to expand, more efficient methods are being developed to enable effective service delivery and value transfer. However, Blockchain technology is bringing another dimension to disrupt the logistics industry in areas such as transparency and efficient tracking.John Monarch, CEO at Shipchain, notes that the logistics sector employs the most people in the world. He explains that as this sector expanded over millennia, it has required innovation to scale and sustain practicality for the growing human population. This is happening again at the time of writing, with the fourth industrial revolution.Monarch tells Cointelegraph:“Connected devices revolving around the Internet of Everything (IoE) need a higher level of security. Blockchain technology is a matchless solution in this regard because it provides the best protection through distributed ledgers, advanced encryption, smart-contracts and reduced intermediaries. As a result, this will tackle corruption, ransomware, theft, premium-fees and tracking issues.”He concludes that once Blockchain networks begin taking their first steps on a mass-market level, they will save the international trade industry at least $50 billion per year. And upon maturity, Blockchain technology could save the logistics industry a whopping $500 billion annually.Blockchain professional Aleksandar Matanovic tells Cointelegraph that Blockchain technology will indeed work as a tool to improve processes by bringing inherent properties into the industry.Matanovic says:“As in many other industries, I don't see Blockchain as a tool to increase efficiency, there are much more efficient systems than Blockchain-based ones. I see it as a way to make systems more transparent, more robust and less dependent on intermediaries.”The COO of BitLand, Christopher Bates, explains that one of the main issues with chain of custody is knowing when property changes ownership or custodianship. Bates uses a car’s history as an example:  “It is pretty important to know if a car has been in a major accident and has frame/structural damage, he says. “If there was an immutable accessible record that kept track of the car history, there would be no way a car salesman could sell a car that had been extremely damaged.”Bates also explains that ownership of land has many problems affecting it around the world.  One of the most consistent problems is when a parcel of land is double or triple sold, meaning a person will sell land to multiple people with only one of the sales (if any) actually being legitimate.  In some places, land titles are kept on paper or are tracked by only a single individual.  In these cases, it’s often impossible to truly know the proper chain of custody, and individuals manipulate ownership records for personal gain.  Given that shipping anything is a sequence of custody handovers, having an immutable record of chain of custody transaction makes it impossible to lose track of who is responsible for a piece of property during each handover.  Existing courier services often track packages along their route, but such methods are imperfect. Bates says:“The issue therein is that since they are mutable, shipment records can be hidden or erased completely to the detriment of the people at large. Governments are able to hide their black budget spending by erasing shipping records or preventing records from being issued at all. On the one hand, governments will argue this is for national security, but on the other hand, the taxpayers that are sponsoring these budgets deserve transparency in spending.”  Blockchain technology combines chain of custody control with the transparency of immutable record-keeping.  This creates an ecosystem that deters malicious actors, as they will eventually become known due to system transparency.  Bates concludes by noting that anyone who claims to be in the decentralization movement should be extremely happy any time a government decides to implement Blockchain tech of any sort.  It means that government is moving towards transparency whether they know it or not."

blockchain, the technology best known as the foundation for Bitcoin.","Jan 21, 2018","The gaming startup B2Expand has added a store to Nexarium, their gaming ecosystem. Players can now buy and sell virtual assets using the native token, Nexium (NXC), as a currency.","Manon Burgel, B2Expand’s head of communication and marketing, has stated that players can use the store to acquire newly created assets such as skins and avatars. The store also serves as a second-hand marketplace where players can trade assets among themselves.Manon:“The store is one of the critical features we are building in our wider blockchain-based gaming ecosystem, which will foster true ownership of players’ gaming assets.”For the last two years, B2Expand has been building Nexarium using blockchain, the technology best known as the foundation for Bitcoin. When complete, Nexarium will include the Nexium token, the store, native and partner games, and game assets.B2Expand created 100 million Nexium tokens on the Ethereum blockchain in November 2016, selling around 28 million to the public through an initial coin offering (ICO) that generated over US$300,000 as development capital for Nexarium.In November 2017, B2Expand released the beta version of Beyond the Void (BTV), a space Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game. BTV is the first native game for Nexarium, with over 10,000 players in beta at the time of writing.The Nexarium game shop is compatible with all ERC20 blockchain assets, Ethereum’s blockchain standard. Nexium is an ERC20 token and can be managed using Ethereum’s infrastructure. Manon:“While you can create a Nexium wallet with tools built-in on the Beyond the Void platform and link it to the game store account, you have the option of using Ethereum wallets. In particular, Nexiums can be received, stored and sent using the Metamask, Mist and Toshi wallets.”Nexium takes on the critical role of currency for players to trade game assets in the game store. Gamers and investors who missed the opportunity to acquire tokens during the ICO can purchase them on exchanges such as Poloniex, Bittrex, HitBTC, Openledger and Etherdelta.B2Expand’s choice to enable external hosting and management of assets such as skins and avatars makes them 100% portable and independent of the Nexarium platform. Players can create or buy assets to use in any game in the ecosystem, collect them, or sell them to other players as Ethereum-based entities. ERC20 compatibility means traders can even sell assets through independent third-party shops.Once more gaming platforms adopt blockchain, B2Expand Game Designer Remi Burgel believes that cross-game trading will become part of the player experience. Gamers will be able to move common assets across platforms. Remi:“For example, a player could move their unique mothership from Beyond the Void to any other space-based game.”In November 2017, video game publisher Ubisoft, in conjunction with leading business incubator Station F, took B2Expand into their startup accelerator program. More than a dozen experts from the program are helping B2Expand implement its business plan, create appropriate designs and observe regulatory requirements.The development team continues to work with beta players to perfect the Nexarium ecosystem. Remi expects the beta game shop to have glitches, but anticipates that all important bugs will be fixed before general release and will not significantly affect the overall player experience.Company name: B2ExpandCompany site: https://www.beyond-the-void.net/wiki/Company contacts: Manon Burgel - COOEmail: manon.burgel@b2expand.com"

This standard policy scares away most first-timers. Cashing out your hard-earned money as a model can also be delayed up to a month due to the payment regulations of these sites and three to five business days rule of traditional bank transfers. And as for the clients, some websites still wall you off until you provide your credit card which makes it pretty hard to remain anonymous.Traditional platforms will often store all sorts of information like ID numbers, geolocations or even private chats, just to name a few which could be alluring data for hackers to steal. These systems are most likely not open source and thus, no one can ensure it completely the data will be encrypted and will be deleted after a while.Comes Live Stars into the picture. The startup company is one of the front-runners in this multi-billion industry to solve these problems by introducing Blockchain technology to the webcam business. Apart from crypto economic efficiency, thanks to Blockchain technology they promise to deliver more privacy, security, control and independence than ever before not only for models but clients as well.Their concept is simple. With the use of Blockchain, their platform will become decentralized helping to cryptographically protect both clients’ and models’ data from fraud. Regarding transactions, Blockchain will also facilitate payment transfers for clients.By issuing their own Blockchain token, named LIVE which is an ERC20 utility token, the company will speed up payments, minimize transactional error and protect clients’ data. This will eliminate third-party payment costs (and time) almost entirely, and thus give their models a much fairer revenue rate of 70-80 percent compared to traditional platforms. Earnings will be accessible to cash out immediately and even models new to the industry can benefit from the start as there is no minimal required sum.As far as anonymity goes, Live Stars will only accept Bitcoins or Ethereum for LIVE tokens during their ICO crowdsale (starting from Jan. 15). The company has managed to raise around $1,250,000 so far at their token presale. If they manage to fully launch their service, the focus will remain on using cryptocurrencies to ensure anonymity. But for those users still unfamiliar with the digital gold, they will still leave a door open and let people buy LIVE tokens with fiat currencies using third-party services.Private video chats and text chats will use webRTC based on one-to-one principle, independently of servers and admins. Another step Live Stars took on their mission to ensure clients can fully hide their identity.Although, this is not the first time the crypto economy mingled with the adult entertainment world but Live Stars and a few other similar startups really try to take the technology behind cryptocurrencies and apply the advantages of Blockchains to the porn industry. They aim to bring a more bottom-up approach and provide a transparent, fair and more secure trade for sex-workers.Yet, while the world frantically, at least on the Internet, talks about the revolutionary aspect of cryptocurrencies, most people still don’t really understand what Bitcoins are and why they seem to be so good for us. And if your average person shies away from buying digital cash, so will models likely to hesitate to enter a webcam business where their income will depend on it.However, according to Live Stars, they have already managed to vow over a number of models to their pre-launched Alpha platform streaming 24/7. This might be the sign the time is ripe for a new Blockchain-savvy generation of sex-workers who will be able to overcome the downsides of the traditional sex industry.And with its global application, Live Stars might be the one paving the way for this much awaited financial and technical innovation for both the adult industry and its digital geishas.Disclaimer.

116,https://cointelegraph.com,"Jan 11, 2018",Encryption Becoming 'Public Safety Issue' - FBI,https://cointelegraph.com/news/encryption-becoming-public-safety-issue-fbi,"... cypherpunks who laid the foundation for the cryptography that powers 
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, massive strides were made.","Jan 11, 2018","Encryption technology has reached a stage where even government agencies like the FBI don’t have the technology to unlock hidden data. In fact, it’s mathematically impossible to break many advanced forms of encryption, regardless of technology or available budget.","While the world’s most well-known investigation authority is tasked with providing the US government with crucial intelligence information, it is struggling to follow up on investigations due to advances in data encryption.As reported by Reuters this week, the FBI was unable to crack over 7,800 devices that contained information the FBI considered vital to ongoing investigations from 2016-2017. The agency has been given legal authority, by the courts, to try and access the data on these devices, but they were simply unable to do so because of the high-level encryption used to protect the information.FBI director Christopher Wray delivered these statistics in an address at the International Conference on Cyber Security.While unpacking the challenges facing the bureau, Wray maintained that the FBI supports advances in encryption and information security. However, that has become a double-edged sword that is making the FBI’s life increasingly difficult:“We face an enormous and increasing number of cases that rely heavily, if not exclusively, on electronic evidence.”Making progress in this regard will take “significant innovation,” according to Wray, but the FBI head does not consider it impossible. To date, half of the devices safeguarded by encryption have been inaccessible, Wray said in his address.While the FBI’s sentiments relate directly to investigations where they have been given legal access to try and break through encryption to unlock information, both state and public individuals have vested interest in encryption technology.Messaging apps that utilize encryption technology have become all the rage, allowing people to communicate without fear of being spied on- for whatever reason. Encrypted communication platforms have become vital in repressive nations like Iran, for instance.Nevertheless, governments around the world have pushed for regulation that allows widespread surveillance of the public. The United Kingdom has done so in a number of instances.The FBI faces an uphill battle against encryption technology and there seems to be no middle ground in this regard. The essence of encryption is to safeguard information by granting access to authorized parties only.Whether or not agencies like the FBI have been given legal authority to decode encrypted data, they are still deemed unauthorized by the encryption itself.The irony here is that modern-day encryption technology stems from developments made primarily by military operations decades ago. The need to protect sensitive information being sent during war times can be attributed to the development of various encryption technologies, which are now widely available to the general public.Once software developers got their hands on the basic code, like the so-called cypherpunks who laid the foundation for the cryptography that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, massive strides were made.In the quest to safeguard information, encryption developers weren’t about to create a backdoor for the FBI and other security agencies to make use of. That would defeat the point and create an entry point for nefarious entities to get their hands on important information.The most likely course of action will be the development of better decryption methods. It’s highly unlikely that software engineers will be making less powerful encryption technology in years to come."

Price Analysis April 8: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BSV, LTC, EOS, BNB, ...","Jan 30, 2018","Following a long-term bearish trend on altcoins this autumn, the cryptocurrency market was surging at the end of the last year. Altcoins as Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Verge (XVG), Cardano (ADA) skyrocketed in the course of two to three week. Many others grew in price by five to ten times with the record-setters, such as Tron (TRX) and Verge - by 20 to 30 times respectively.","Many altcoins proved to be stabilizing. Major players such as Ethereum (ETH) increased immensely with a huge capitalization. It should be noted that the increase in prices has been growing alongside a relatively stable BTC price, which means that all the generated profits were nominated not only in US dollars but also in BTC.By investing a minimum of one BTC in XVG at the price of 50 Satoshi in early December, an investor could sell it at the price of 1,500 Satoshis with a 30-time return on investment within just two weeks. To make a good investment in these coins, one simply needed to register at three major cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Bitfinex, Bittrex, Binance. There you can also monitor listings of new coins that could generate substantial profit as demand for them grows in the long run.Another area on the market that is less known, but no less potentially profitable, is emerging crypto assets that are not yet listed on major exchanges. And this is not surprising, as being listed on a major exchange is rather time and effort-consuming for any startup project. Hundreds of applications are received by markets every day, but cannot be accepted immediately, as new coin undergoes a check of its technical specs of a new coin and its real demand on the market.Each new coin that is to be listed would either draw back the liquidity from other traded pairs or become a dead-weight and delude the traders damaging the exchange’s reputation at the same time. Several instances of this can be observed at the hitBTC listed pairs overview.That is why a great number of really valuable up-and-coming crypto assets with good chances for growth are starting at minor exchanges, where the conditions to be listed are less strict. Here these coins are making the first sparkles and then increase in price several times more once they get to a big exchange, like Bittrex. These are assets that if managed correctly from the start could make an investor very rich.Let’s look into five new assets that, if invested in December 2017, would have generated an amazing profit for the investor and could maybe generate even more in the near future.Only assets with the trade volumes no less than $1 mln were taken into consideration. All the “shit coins” that are growing at pump and dump schemes were filtered. Assets that are traded at major exchanges such as Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex, Binance were not taken into consideration either.All mentioned crypto assets (or “coins”) have been selected by the following criteria:RaiBlocks (XRB) is a coin, built on DAG-technology along with well-known IOTA, focusing on fast microtransactions. One of the important points why this coin was picked is demand for DAG technology in industry and a broad market for future implementation.Dent (DENT) is used for sharing prepaid packages of mobile data. According to Cisco review, 15 percent of mobile data is unused and this is the market of 4.8 bln dollars. User cases are as follows: sharing unused data packages, avoid roaming, automated buying mobile data for IoT devices at best price. This concept is good for future demand on Dent token, so it was selected.IoT Chain (ITC) is a coin from a Chinese-based startup, providing high-scalable transactions for IoT industry. The project is based on a high-scalable DAG version. IoT in general is a trend in the industry and a new high-qualified project, which could present an interesting opportunity in an investment portfolio.Dragonchain (DRGN) is a new Blockchain platform, designed by Disney. The platform is high-scalable, has huge functionality and can serve many fields of operation - smart contracts, identity, intellectual property, p2p financial instruments and many others. Also, the platform is building its own ecosystem with startup incubator. At the moment Look Lateral - an Italian project selling art with Blockchain rights fixation as well as LifeID (Blockchain-based identity) are making a product using Dragonchain. According to the top-tier company behind this project and technological functionality, this asset is surely a “little coin, going big.”XTRABYTES (XBY) is a platform for dApps, offering high-scalability and decentralization opportunities over current Blockchain technologies. The team created a new consensus method, Proof-of-Signature and algorithm Zolt. This project seems good and new-tech oriented, so possible high-demand for XBY coin may arise if XTRABYTES solution becomes used widely.Profitability from holding these “little coins” was compared to buying and holding major crypto assets like ETH and XRP at the same time as demonstrated below. RaiBlocks demonstrated an enormous price growth rate, giving a 70 times increase on the investment; Dent provided 23 times capital growth. Otherwise little, but promising coins that were selected are comparable to XRP and significantly higher profit of investment in comparison to ETH.It seems that these coins with good fundament and technology were unknown in a major part of the community whose price greatly increased once discovered by investors. Besides fundamental reasons of investment, many of them probably keep in mind that after listing on major exchanges price will be rising even more, when a very large community and big money will have direct access to trade these coins.Assets in the crypto industry grow rapidly if there is a large influx of funds coming in from new investors with simultaneous holding by earlier investors. The price increase, in this case, is due to the constantly increasing demand together with the shrinking amount in circulation. After listing on a bigger exchange, like Bittrex or Binance, the demand grows massively, which increases the price even further.For this reason, investors would monitor new coins introduced to smaller exchanges, because these assets are seriously underestimated due to the lack of audience and low trade volume. But constant monitoring can be rather tedious and requires having multiple accounts, which is time-consuming. On the other hand, potentially attractive coins don’t get a decent audience, because investors would rather prefer to purchase a new asset once it is listed on some bigger exchange. That results in a huge price increase and high volatility: massive funds are injected to the coin instantly at its purchase.One of the current issues of the market should be facilitating the access to new assets for investors. On one hand, it will be easier for new users to start investing into crypto assets, and on the other hand, it would bring audience and liquidity to new coins.  This is possible only by means of integrating all exchanges into one technical and visual interface that would allow trading multiple cryptocurrency pairs in one terminal at single-click ease. Once deployed, this would bring about another perk for both traders and new coins: traders would be able to start buying the coin from the date it was listed at any of the exchanges that are part of this integrated network, while the coin gets a more extended and organic timeline of growth.The problem has already been tackled by several teams. One of them is B2BX that ran a successful ICO in late 2017. They plan to make the first official B2B cryptocurrency exchange aggregator or marketplace to connect institutional clients, forex/DMA and stockbrokers with cryptocurrency exchanges. So, when the B2BX product is delivered on the market, cryptocurrency exchanges could receive more liquidity. The project is targeting brokerage houses, liquidity providers and institutional investors, the majority of the traders will have access to the market via their forex or stockbrokers.Another startup that proved to be pretty successful is Arbidex – the platform that integrates crypto exchanges into one single interface with a built-in mechanism for automated arbitrage. The Arbidex team claims that integration of cryptocurrency exchanges together with the additional functionality as an automated arbitrage system will provide more liquidity to trading pairs and eliminate borders between exchanges. Using only one Arbidex account, a customer can buy and sell crypto assets and coins at all connected exchanges.So, new trading pairs on major exchanges like Binance or small like Livecoin automatically are in availability to trade for all Arbidex users. They even offer a breakthrough high-end trading terminal for traders, integrating orderbooks and trading pairs from multiple exchanges with an opportunity to make extra profit.The third solution can seen in the Japanese project Liquid, which is operating under Quinone Corporation, which has the exchange license from the Japanese authority. One of the project goals is to provide liquidity for the cryptocurrency exchange market and to create a worldwide order book.This year seems to be bringing more maturity to cryptocurrency exchange markets. Hopefully we will see the introduction of market brokerage platforms and services with trading tools such as professional trading terminals, analytics, and the possibility to buy and sell the majority of crypto assets in one window. What if 2018 is the year of little coins becoming big?Disclaimer: The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

Blockchain Technology Be Used to Build Evil Social Credit Systems?","Jan 16, 2018","Looking around at the world, trust is probably the thing that is most lacking in our current business environment. Technology is at a strange middling capability, where it can do a lot more, but we never have any strong way of verifying who is on the other end of a transaction.","The emergence of companies like Craigslist and eBay saw many people gain seemingly random connections with others by doing business through the Internet, but it also saw an increase in fraud and worse. These were made possible by the faceless interactions that occurred through new connections made over the Internet, and the result was a populace that was mistrustful of any sort of business being carried out completely through the Internet.Many people were afraid to use their credit cards online for the longest time. The general opinion was that you would almost definitely get ripped off if you did so, and this made difficult for many companies to establish themselves.If people want someone to trust in a business interaction with a massive company, then it should be realized that this feeling applies doubly to the peer-to-peer (P2P) market. Doing deals with someone you have never met requires some level of “trust” that most people are too jaded to have.This is where Blockchain technology factors in. The P2P market can benefit greatly from implementing Blockchain technology so that nobody needs to take a leap of faith, and can instead just depend on the quality of the technology verifying the trust.With the advent of companies like Uber and Airbnb, the sharing economy truly is beginning to take over the world, but some barriers are preventing it from scaling out in other sectors like the car-sharing industry. The world is experiencing lower demand for car ownership and a higher demand for car sharing, but trust has become a barrier to scaling this out.Darenta is a company that thinks they can beat this problem by applying Blockchain technology to create a solution that allows for users to share their cars with ease. The end result will be a safer experience for customers where they can trust each other not to rip them off.If things go according to plan, Darenta could end up being the largest international platform for car rentals on Blockchain in the world. The basic idea is that private car owners can rent out their insured cars over the car sharing IT platform. The project depends upon a mobile solution which employs geolocation, smart contracts and other Blockchain technology.Car ownership has dropped as more alternatives have emerged, but there is still a need for cars in the world. Car sharing can work to significantly reduce the number of cars on the road, which would free up more parking spaces and improve the ecology of Earth at the same time.The Darenta ICO is currently underway, and Productoken is attracting vast amounts of crypto funds and backers. The token adds a new level of functionality to the service since it helps car owners earn more and token holders apply discounts.Around three months after the completion of the ICO, ProducTokens will be permitted to be used in calculations for rent, as well as for encouraging customers to participate in the ecosystem. This participation adds value in the same way that Amazon reviews improve the entire platform experience and have made Amazon the first choice for those looking to buy goods online. Tokens only make sense when they have a use case, and it is clear Darenta’s ProducToken fulfills this condition.Will Bartlett, Guest AuthorDisclaimer.
